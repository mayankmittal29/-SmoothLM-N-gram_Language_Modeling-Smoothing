Average perplexity: 30036.62485472398
I am not at all afraid of her dying .	7669.827268369181
and so accomplished !	12211.915646097563
but without scheming to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery .	12707.10995959954
She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest , by talking of their supposed marriage , and planning his happiness in such an alliance .	58443.415188123836
Hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was very glad ;	5011.663705084146
I told you in the library , you know , that I should never speak to you again , and you will find me as good as my word .	1210.3266571965942
The house , furniture , neighbourhood , and roads , were all to her taste , and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most friendly and obliging .	42346.83033043779
and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle directly .	5288.003388135906
If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection , Elizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty .	101600.41984983443
My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness , and in a cause of such moment as this , I shall certainly not depart from it .	7939.202475231343
The pain of separation , however , might be alleviated on his side , by preparations for the reception of his bride , as he had reason to hope , that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire , the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men .	2523.6225853479655
No , I thank you ;	1768.6147315073792
I have suspected it some time , but I am now convinced .	2589.218829453272
Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again , and weakened her disgust of Collins .	43046.32075155842
It was unpardonable .	8628.349485357952
No , said Colonel Fitzwilliam , that is an advantage which he must divide with me .	3394.464388925312
and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the probability of a rainy season , made her feel that the commonest , dullest , most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker .	8235.975950733171
Their visitors staid with them above half an hour , and when they arose to depart , Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing and Gardiner , and Miss Bennet , to dinner at Pemberley , before they left the country .	3458.4067543117167
But upon my honour I do not .	3882.742191014577
She blushed , and Jane blushed ;	54928.52514272722
I promised them so faithfully !	171595.8289536097
which are naturally lively enough .	83696.28575906566
It was a subject , in short , on which reflection would be long indulged , and must be unavailing .	4652.684572925342
The rooms were lofty and handsome , and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor ;	70713.64033250306
and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour Lady Lucas .	3349.0400625812185
but Darcy , at whom it was all aimed , was still inflexibly studious .	49917.600623146885
What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosing's Park , when he put his letter into her hand !	51891.40847466621
Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas , for Collins was only a clergyman ;	9408.027919916283
The Collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave ;	50691.22260226689
Do you consider the forms of introduction , and the stress that is laid on them , as nonsense ?	70126.31781400368
As for Jane , her anxiety under this suspence was , of course , more painful than Elizabeth's ;	28711.95766336327
Indeed !	6914.001990722626
and I particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at Netherfield , '_She a beauty !	30611.23827933661
I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well , I assure you .	4855.65635362034
and , perhaps , if I have very good luck , I may meet with another Collins in time .	4810.84501860888
From herself to Jane from Jane to Bingley , her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Darcy's explanation there , had appeared very insufficient ;	32605.145292546993
My father , however , is partial to Wickham .	2849.588026680695
The dejection was almost universal .	189555.67491377215
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper ;	8816.851063712133
But in spite of all this fine talking , my dear Lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured , that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair .	3262.928652440021
No why should he ?	56296.60945533674
As Gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she and her children should go to London , at the same time that Bennet came from it .	1076.8905300992992
Yet , how just a humiliation !	97931.76429941949
Nay , when I read a letter of his , I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham , much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law .	19829.733572106095
Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ?	3152.553269504259
Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and which he thought the prettiest ?	9836.539145583312
In the afternoon , the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves ;	1511.584535592806
He has children of his own , and may have more .	2320.4985340100707
Family pride , and filial pride , for he is very proud of what his father was , have done this .	28448.59294983906
It was to this effect : Since writing the above , dearest Lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ;	4419.599901182561
Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield , which was fixed for the following Tuesday .	7018.452224528107
This was his plan of amends of atonement for inheriting their father's estate ;	96238.90652463904
and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached .	16515.67010223185
If you will thank me , he replied , let it be for yourself alone .	3939.33056612061
I hope he will overlook it .	3236.385955009526
Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her .	11147.405216236364
that he should have been in love with her for so many months !	504.0430421958861
She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting .	1488.0359600220306
and as she considered that Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations , and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct , she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before .	5625.457087313494
Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again ?	13728.348015903652
She was ashamed to think how much .	4067.719809781929
Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends ?	13978.713659054636
She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference .	13106.433507901647
1813 .	6847.919774710029
Do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart .	14530.140665393483
and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer !	20787.027378768817
Did you , on reading it , give any credit to its contents ?	41898.74942238584
When tea was over , Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table but in vain .	8620.078819893033
Yes , he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word .	14486.154079525057
and Elizabeth found , that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations' consent , there was still something to be wished for .	14318.831401947566
and neither the carriage , nor the livery of the servant who preceded it , were familiar to them .	27098.34224353205
Oh , well !	56998.06026465105
for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ;	16159.058082645202
Is nothing due to me on that score ?	218048.26004707324
but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter and said , Jane , I congratulate you .	430.41376602139337
Bennet's best comfort was , that Bingley must be down again in the summer .	8104.270553167297
and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , I never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them .	12812.61626832086
The park paling was still the boundary on one side , and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground .	4802.33871321241
Jane certainly could not come back .	22434.654061487134
To the civil enquiries which then poured in , and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Bingley's , she could not make a very favourable answer .	3997.9349608795806
He begged pardon for having displeased her .	34214.385354638776
But she is nothing to me now .	1596.3946247235747
Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time .	21939.433207537528
Miss Darcy , on her brother's entrance , exerted herself much more to talk ;	4082.9529068819675
He made no answer , and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton .	1594.780096699355
the nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people !	57918.00397009252
If , indeed , it should be so !	1391.8806062985495
I cannot fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation .	15969.516610042388
He had rather hoped that all his wife's views on the stranger would be disappointed ;	33418.7652335293
CHAPTER XVI .	1403.50908934543
Her report was highly favourable .	215465.26795593966
Every body said how well she looked ;	34302.95912233869
He seemed scarcely to hear her , and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation ;	7755.997062885112
They were now almost at the door of the house , for she had walked fast to get rid of him ;	901.1049392154976
He is so excessively handsome !	18381.636337800057
for Long has just been here , and she told me all about it .	3257.766082606858
where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure ;	8808.359268153743
Darcy , after enquiring of her how and Gardiner did , a question which she could not answer without confusion , said scarcely any thing .	13822.487770047968
They gradually ascended for half a mile , and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence , where the wood ceased , and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House , situated on the opposite side of a valley , into which the road with some abruptness wound .	36492.45003355679
He was too happy , however , to need much attention ;	1355.246933391544
Why Jane you never dropt a word of this ;	38860.47498201939
It was all pride and insolence .	27928.516734550234
How does Georgiana get on , Darcy ?	29914.80073955221
At such a distance as that , you know , things are strangely misrepresented .	10454.178714349018
and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted .	34319.73845614999
We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured .	3424.93146747198
pray make haste and come into the dining-room , for there is such a sight to be seen !	2106.553377771973
When they were gone , Elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent .	7658.423113430479
My dear Eliza he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way .	1840.181296724296
Her ease and good spirits increased .	74120.19391351391
Elizabeth , who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Darcy had been , was much relieved by discerning such different feelings .	9757.1046085048
Oh , yes !	522.7852403671635
, but its volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous locations .	286155.114637121
Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship , in spite of a great opposition of character .	12444.614500652413
said Charlotte , as soon as he was gone .	446.81073795695994
There is also one other person in the party , he continued after a pause , who more particularly wishes to be known to you , Will you allow me , or do I ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton ?	4794.238824761825
When a woman has five grown up daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty .	29240.63391179314
cried his wife impatiently .	13743.87155389043
Neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude , replied Elizabeth , have any possible claim on me , in the present instance .	21545.193408486808
and addressed herself particularly to Bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation .	6257.619155325327
His manners are very different from his cousin's .	89266.60136518549
But it is so strange !	5855.166901997094
About ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire , to which he belonged .	8735.572289880916
And pray what sort of guardians do you make ?	42559.561670006646
Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in my dressing-room .	21363.06809116645
Can you possibly guess , Lizzy , who is meant by this ?	14511.627246786149
You may depend upon my not mentioning it .	948.5707409762565
and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs .	4911.03397392713
and to prevent its ever happening again , took care to inform him at first , that it was a favourite haunt of hers .	8935.27657444557
certainly , cried his faithful assistant , no one can be really esteemed accomplished , who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with .	21353.45593697468
He was writing , and , without raising his head , coolly replied , Just as you please .	4373.214112969195
March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford .	49345.08635988445
Bennet was perfectly satisfied ;	15137.429955012984
When the gentlemen rose to go away , Bennet was mindful of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time .	2617.0148110868863
that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking Darcy's character , though he had assured her that respect for the father , would always prevent his exposing the son .	28031.17475172091
His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost .	58050.36478072295
I have not the smallest hope .	3418.3265837797544
She coloured as she spoke ;	75588.32408334601
She opened the door , and met Maria in the landing place , who , breathless with agitation , cried out , Oh , my dear Eliza !	4230.879834525685
There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed .	56973.322246815216
You shall hear what she says .	1262.657130393288
I do not see what right Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend's inclination , or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy .	13331.34518925483
A few weeks , he believed .	31176.203118055673
But think no more of the letter .	794.9195974289182
When is your next ball to be , Lizzy ?	23281.603070256868
You see how continually we are engaged there .	18416.909312766118
Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours ;	380728.3208931227
You know I always speak my mind , and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves .	5546.623974916346
See paragraph 1 .	14647.793797913855
I am happier even than Jane ;	18950.80292173672
but it must be done soon .	1464.5326159647068
they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence ;	49156.48261546424
if it must be so , it must .	5075.380089492581
I should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match , cried Elizabeth .	1058.3421829785188
She followed her father to the fire place , and they both sat down .	9595.395358918879
We have judged it best , that my niece should be married from this house , of which I hope you will approve .	13264.491024866891
and , after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable composure .	3831.3932896960696
Yes , she will remain there till Christmas .	7286.057511849029
Special rules , set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license , apply to copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark .	12746.278923822878
and Gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing , by the servant's account , that their niece was taken suddenly ill ;	58527.29571651147
Remember , Eliza , that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do .	2675.1934683198288
but I think I shall like your husband quite as well as Jane's .	10600.673605699063
I do not think we were speaking at all .	759.7714905380279
Well , cried her mother , it is all very right ;	882.4018968904688
and Hurst , principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings , joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss Bennet .	36994.40294516198
Yet he is such a man !	846.4251616671514
You have delighted us long enough .	8382.92925173306
Bennet could hardly contain herself .	25478.889285662015
Be that as it may , she saw him go with regret ;	33033.90677851125
She had even learnt to detect , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary .	47342.94435598764
dear me !	73001.62083072688
when it was no longer likely they should meet .	6238.775987016495
but with the rich , he is liberal-minded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and perhaps agreeable , allowing something for fortune and figure .	24230.68704241776
and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him .	16379.423592667988
You blamed me for coming ?	53047.13870639562
Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield ;	25825.09353041151
and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look .	14434.520530962893
Have you any idea , Lizzy , who this gentleman is ?	22264.055153051468
It was not in her nature , however , to increase her vexations , by dwelling on them .	1083.560071641449
and even Darcy acknowledged , that the partridges were remarkably well done ;	28240.709818100233
There is something very pompous in his style .	38502.98780176097
You certainly do , she replied with a smile ;	9167.228159461625
and though Collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as I have often told her , to come to Rosings every day , and play on the piano-forte in Jenkinson's room .	6105.100404609323
Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to conciliate her .	23530.07351019922
and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet .	1474.8466875446484
They contained no actual complaint , nor was there any revival of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering .	72606.77293072607
Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage ;	15990.37421828072
Kitty was the only one who shed tears ;	17859.902455087453
And then you have added so much to it yourself , you are always buying books .	15917.41483287111
This cannot be !	861.1526794554889
and Elizabeth , who knew what curiosities his letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise .	7197.36177889421
When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer , I made a point of her having two men servants go with her .	12097.441656706931
Elizabeth , on her side , had much to do .	1206.3611417934383
The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a headache ;	93258.07766438606
Indeed , Jane , you ought to believe me .	1094.2001525281407
And so would Anne , if her health had allowed her to apply .	32579.516010761683
I will read it to you When my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to London , might be concluded in three or four days , but as we are certain it cannot be so , and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town , he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel .	8372.186347284713
They entered it in one of its lowest points , and drove for some time through a beautiful wood , stretching over a wide extent .	23448.665528508547
May we take my uncle's letter to read to her ?	101733.67664394372
When the card tables were placed , he had an opportunity of obliging her in return , by sitting down to whist .	8558.553999643702
After a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display .	11783.204328824597
but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands .	10082.093584813585
he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and that , if he marry prudently , his wife may teach him .	37283.757285857275
and Bennet , for many years after Lydia's birth , had been certain that he would .	8968.748967538031
and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements , new carriages and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield , in the course of three or four months .	8598.970099771703
hatred had vanished long ago , and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him , that could be so called .	29302.38682345372
But I will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well .	2936.6518410022627
If his own vanity , however , did not mislead him , he was the cause , his pride and caprice were the cause of all that Jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer .	3619.8313279213658
I fancy , Lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all .	5565.921299866249
Their affectionate mother shared all their grief ;	216167.40468535657
a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room .	6585.433067414053
Pray , how violent was Bingley's love ?	32298.082867613197
but Lady Catherine very resolutely , and not very politely , declined eating any thing ;	21858.653612612285
Now what have you to say ?	10665.158580379497
and in front , a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater , but without any artificial appearance .	48461.84487806466
He carved , and ate , and praised with delighted alacrity ;	164908.66537855187
E5 .	1376184.626012499
But though every thing seemed neat and comfortable , she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance ;	34874.632012408416
When I am in the country , he replied , I never wish to leave it ;	567.9714293596427
It only shews her being deficient in something herself sense or feeling .	77553.48744182919
Yes , very well .	1138.5697649349509
and , though she was not very sanguine in expecting it , the application was a something to look forward to .	5694.3936257328905
Is this a hint to me , Lizzy , said her father , to send for the horses ?	1212.734606156952
and more than commonly anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her .	17615.636875164386
However , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts , and I am very glad to hear what you tell us , of long sleeves .	3116.485010252264
you know he is , as well as I do ;	1765.2172077249513
Pray forgive me , if I have been very presuming , or at least do not punish me so far , as to exclude me from P I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park .	7927.545650271378
Your idea of the ponies is delightful .	30496.743847666778
then recollecting himself , I will not detain you a minute , but let me , or let the servant , go after and Gardiner .	11265.935044144964
In the first place , he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron .	6220.481008683766
but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you .	3120.41159370491
Bennet could not have chosen better .	3941.458472320914
and know them to be so much attached to me !	8785.517897179287
Her sister made not the smallest objection , and the piano-forte was opened , and Darcy , after a few moments recollection , was not sorry for it .	1283.979800800103
Elizabeth was surprised , but said not a word .	187.92470248390285
CHAPTER X More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park , unexpectedly meet Darcy .	37726.74825996309
They have none of them much to recommend them , replied he ;	4078.5217290899313
After walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on resuming their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant , there chanced to be a little alteration .	10995.271034131276
and Collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much .	36786.13455195669
and yet it should seem by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy .	1423.3781546955174
I dare say you believed it ;	1063.9595072587827
You are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on ;	15783.217211047873
nothing , therefore , could be fairly conjectured from that , though Elizabeth , who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings , was perfectly aware , that , had she known nothing of Darcy , she could have borne the dread of Lydia's infamy somewhat better .	4718.690184313504
her voice was weak , and her manner affected .	28821.595913006655
Would you believe it , Lizzy , that when he went to town last November , he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent , would have prevented his coming down again !	5220.554529732423
he kissed it with affectionate gallantry , though he hardly knew how to look , and they entered the house .	5746.805200475422
The particulars , I reserve till we meet .	172660.72997576548
and she looked on the whole scene , the river , the trees scattered on its banks , and the winding of the valley , as far as she could trace it , with delight .	10474.02753883953
It was an animating subject , and Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match .	8628.872176598365
Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ;	11273.559183342708
Neither could any thing be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities which Darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach .	20213.485773253353
She then sought her eldest sister , who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley .	5381.791537153163
From Collins !	50059.93521471717
Will you do me the honour of reading that letter ?	18383.52689035857
So , Lizzy , said he one day , your sister is crossed in love I find .	3227.610016836491
Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately ;	3584.1002296485276
There was no want of discourse .	842.7180665601188
His coming into the country at all , is a most insolent thing indeed , and I wonder how he could presume to do it .	1530.827240125049
So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him !	24775.155750150134
and he was obliged to walk about the room , while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences .	7787.334768196518
How well it sounds .	236468.86558704826
It should not be said , that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers .	1643.2661016772345
and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself ;	17398.338830618482
They found Bennet still up .	25783.749261638524
and they conversed with so much spirit and flow , as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself , as well as of Darcy .	2598.9336905287605
But it is , returned she ;	3130.501275012443
He shook his head .	2829.9084802589614
His daughter's request , for such it might be considered , of being admitted into her family again , before she set off for the North , received at first an absolute negative .	28145.85153622554
Stop me whilst you can .	47324.76806937168
Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure , and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming , when she found herself so affectionately received .	19132.88121639826
Is it possible !	77990.94453255006
Let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ;	14753.2687533153
He delighted in going to Pemberley , especially when he was least expected .	12989.715554786855
I had no notion but he would go a shooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company .	5610.831924384065
Elizabeth was in agonies .	58429.63694055482
Your uncle is as much surprised as I am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned , would have allowed him to act as he has done .	7329.656277047955
This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted : and Elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away .	12380.561488447036
Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to his wife ?	60947.83455455492
On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects .	7250.924872483868
An express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from Colonel Forster , to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers ;	5960.303685880531
This has been my motive , my fair cousin , and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem .	2609.072199853651
You ought certainly to forgive them as a christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing .	51028.441498133274
I will not encourage the impudence of either , by receiving them at Longbourn .	4581.9064589384825
The next morning , however , made an alteration ;	3815.2187266742585
Charlotte is an excellent manager , I dare say .	9836.365265953973
It is evident by this , added Jane , that he comes back no more this winter .	1520.9899124969302
To be sure that did seem as if he admired her indeed I rather believe he did I heard something about it but I hardly know what something about Robinson .	13030.56901329145
With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ;	72617.5696626613
When she remembered the style of his address , she was still full of indignation ;	23210.132950819858
When first Bennet had married , economy was held to be perfectly useless ;	77899.20055604649
The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came , and Bennet was forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle , was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth .	3836.3431662827907
can it be really so !	36875.135322079856
She had never seen a place for which nature had done more , or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste .	20684.83578457979
I hope , added Gardiner , that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her .	16133.061266555605
what can have induced him to behave so cruelly ?	218514.17099472813
Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications .	30794.604486586955
His eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity ;	32514.54815028526
As soon as all had ate , and the elder ones paid , the carriage was ordered ;	18163.144333206867
You know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself .	6921.938696004188
Let me hear what it is .	535.9363443340566
He meant , I believe , replied Jane , to go to Epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the postilions , and try if any thing could be made out from them .	9375.569961866633
observed Bennet .	131901.544869642
and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible .	1004.2567108064253
The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic .	26898.699931464856
My overhearings were more to the purpose than yours , Eliza , said Charlotte .	24713.62802739848
his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had .	17577.842681830076
said Elizabeth .	1787.5588027056042
The first mentioned was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , I had detached Bingley from your sister , and the other , that I had , in defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , ruined the immediate prosperity , and blasted the prospects of Wickham .	5706.482368708854
Darcy is all politeness , said Elizabeth , smiling .	3048.998782609742
said Jane .	1762.3270042612578
It was some days , however , before they received any invitation thither , for while there were visitors in the house , they could not be necessary ;	2670.613432668245
Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth and it was soon done done while Bennet was stirring the fire .	20107.03577586286
I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings , and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three , of whom we shall deprive you .	34630.98301457758
It taught me to hope , said he , as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before .	3073.1805247360885
but since then , we have both , I hope , improved in civility .	4053.198877358246
but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him .	3799.4172314619755
When Jane and Elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in her praise of Bingley before , expressed to her sister how very much she admired him .	12720.413421168652
There can be no love in all this .	1264.0763125134565
Yet it is hard , she sometimes thought , that this poor man cannot come to a house , which he has legally hired , without raising all this speculation !	45832.07072669887
and Bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice .	5076.125293346102
Good heavens !	398762.7451424397
If I had been able , said she , to carry my point of going to Brighton , with all my family , this would not have happened ;	610.9705022970534
Indeed I had .	13444.529252252616
and in the mean time , she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married , to Hill and the two housemaids .	7380.465347977468
Lydia's being settled in the North , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment ;	17592.194056268592
The younger ones out before the elder are married !	7561.318924446586
My excellent father died about five years ago ;	186668.11052224762
We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening , said Elizabeth .	14149.965844159598
And if you will stay another month complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London , for I am going there early in June , for a week ;	2021.8319005263118
Lizzy , you must not do so .	361.00409337427556
Only look at her .	6686.709311221101
and the Hursts have no horses to theirs .	76976.44903275209
She directly replied , You need not be frightened .	31109.922955761016
How nicely we are crammed in !	64651.04754374402
The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning's impatience .	99483.81133668909

Lizzy , when you first read that letter , I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now .	2347.8255011662427
but her's she thought was still worse .	60146.77632465024
and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty .	11406.5679167273
But does Lydia know nothing of this ?	11716.421129276328
She counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent ;	157648.06554355143
Can such abominable pride as his , have ever done him good ?	195739.26789784475
Oh !	3082.833849588038
Good Heaven !	1450.8423596756263
Have all her friends left her ?	35107.89114897633
Their brother , indeed , was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency .	4810.203674103831
The colour which had been driven from her face , returned for half a minute with an additional glow , and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes , as she thought for that space of time , that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken .	14429.390309373306
Pardon me .	9994.177078804174
My dear , dear Lizzy , I would I do congratulate you but are you certain ?	2756.0145885523552
Her father had been an attorney in Meryton , and had left her four thousand pounds .	1003.4180040238626
She had fully proposed being engaged by Wickham for those very dances : and to have Collins instead !	67640.2788433458
I am so grieved for him .	1070.5695852816884
She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together .	3274.8712846723797
no , I certainly am not .	6775.97457515335
You quite mistook Darcy .	47617.8629566173
but this is the true one .	9825.450401994114
Yes , in conjunction with his friend .	4029.0927779388785
and still different from either , was what Bennet sent to Collins , in reply to his last .	12330.684965296112
Bingley was every thing that was charming , except the professed lover of her daughter .	4826.530606016966
They repulsed every attempt of Bennet at conversation , and by so doing , threw a languor over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Collins , who was complimenting Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests .	8090.3995853834795
As all conversation was thereby at an end , Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room .	10059.26907947414
Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject ;	10620.105637168235
When first he came in , he had spoken to her but little ;	5620.90210856695
If it is designedly done , they cannot be justified ;	95141.10930510449
But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both .	18491.222642839606
and , as they drew near the appointed inn where Bennet's carriage was to meet them , they quickly perceived , in token of the coachman's punctuality , both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs .	13268.638153167474
What , none of you ?	22687.865723296163
Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman , and required information ;	34006.92905209758
Well , my comfort is , I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done .	1453.7426632771667
Too much , I am afraid ;	7521.454770585165
This was very amiable , but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any conception of ;	32770.44482571444
His family knew him to be on all common occasions , a most negligent and dilatory correspondent , but at such a time , they had hoped for exertion .	21561.943493336068
His first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance , as far as it would go .	2934.4269497257465
She wanted to talk , but there seemed an embargo on every subject .	5420.683628552731
In every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived .	5524.844970863202
but on perceiving Darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner .	34388.92380133112
She was more alive to the disgrace , which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham , a fortnight before they took place .	15018.901849029113
and Gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in London the very next day , and would assist Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia .	1778.2121009357402
And then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you ;	15353.323450147953
As for Elizabeth , her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last ;	13269.124561303273
They are not married , nor can I find there was any intention of being so ;	11751.791065095658
for you are really proud of your defects in writing , because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution , which if not estimable , you think at least highly interesting .	38027.247977505365
You never will be able to make both of them good for any thing .	2261.542597354132
They walked towards the Lucases , because Kitty wished to call upon Maria ;	29301.11612700022
But you see that Jane , said her aunt , does not think so ill of Wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt .	576.1323976883209
I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ;	12465.26021277782
it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it .	2747.0502385336367
The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend , assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London , might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment .	7160.4311513284365
She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either , or make either appear to advantage .	16277.758884175722
You allude perhaps to the entail of this estate .	5767.4542899739545
She could not win him , however , to any conversation ;	3195.2294712338357
by her ease and liveliness , his mind might have been softened , his manners improved , and from his judgment , information , and knowledge of the world , she must have received benefit of greater importance .	15259.610630752164
Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone .	61206.069272254994
I enquired after their brother , of course .	5568.860711661472
Bennet could hardly comprehend it .	25434.284775035205
and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both .	3671.286404224864
Dear me !	68231.34927640967
by reason , by reflection , by every thing .	35191.543327321066
to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed , and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation , console herself for the present , and prepare for another disappointment .	6054.174434162842
During dinner , Bennet scarcely spoke at all ;	53813.87705058399
To convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself , was no very difficult point .	10247.354734121
my daughters are brought up differently .	76170.35148117579
and after listening a moment , she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry , and calling loudly after her .	17541.06665750998
Why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent , said she , did he come at all ?	8549.727117336599
I do think it is the hardest thing in the world , that your estate should be entailed away from your own children ;	2963.1683386916025
Bennet treasured up the hint , and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married ;	11421.876586574435
Do you know Bingley ?	4841.453553793141
Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy .	13519.902611385534
and very unwillingly said so .	25564.139063713745
Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter ;	37161.28037380269
Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not .	5819.494289719444
He had been some time with Gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river , and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning .	4542.606374489902
He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies , of whose beauty he had heard much ;	5723.66056856682
Good God !	55991.30511883923
Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever .	8973.35946546055
Something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them , but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life .	1679.7770658987213
it came from Netherfield , and was opened immediately .	836.4665695769183
They have each their advantages , and I can be equally happy in either .	14763.060181487948
She was wild to be at home to hear , to see , to be upon the spot , to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her , in a family so deranged ;	13783.154981200816
In making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self-reproach .	9073.220553690204
CHAPTER I Elizabeth , as they drove along , watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation ;	28494.978773092247
Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance ;	25529.89362021921
And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton , of whom I shall subjoin a list , according to his information .	7939.710319616361
But make a virtue of it by all means .	12832.59636882018
Arguments are too much like disputes .	184535.0708998162
I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , Lizzy ?	2082.584643474337
The rest of the evening passed with the appearance , on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no farther attempt to distinguish Elizabeth ;	6429.823198350122
I believe , Ma'am , I may safely promise you never to dance with him .	1356.7696533506742
No , no .	732.0738627388362
and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least .	11467.225711495126
At length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself .	3206.729496755592
She followed him with her eyes , envied every one to whom he spoke , had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee ;	19771.202839806552
I never saw such a long chin in my life .	975.6903825523993
I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield .	1890.564706896307
cried Elizabeth ;	1569.6672588540628
but this was all lost upon me .	4235.219161857788
No , Kitty , I have at last learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it .	6882.602125590366
The principal purport of his letter was to inform them , that Wickham had resolved on quitting the Militia .	5647.42298555865
I shall be very fit to see Jane which is all I want .	10209.03606454338
When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford , every eye was in search of the Parsonage , and every turning expected to bring it in view .	12177.38046265234
her complexion has no brilliancy ;	288612.4776737354
said her mother as soon as she was in the hall .	1439.5325928068958
They will join me early to-morrow , he continued , and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you , Bingley and his sisters .	8699.712523660985
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity .	6641.897553353967
I do not mind his not talking to Long , said Miss Lucas , but I wish he had danced with Eliza .	4448.234668992914
but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder .	2896.749675023328
Yes , there can ;	6746.11830174088
If you received the work electronically , the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund .	1806.6749601567515
Make haste , make haste .	7745.819453122194
My reasons for believing it are briefly these : It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance , or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable .	20755.68096306921
After amusing himself some time with their curiosity , he thus explained .	87642.77003675756
I had not believed it possible .	8534.230791513319
Forgive me ;	11338.798108582507
This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself .	11890.365993490728
Darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say something indistinctly of his concern , and observe her in compassionate silence .	11172.558982185727
At length there was nothing more to be said ;	5712.2496253416275
Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ;	72024.61426899658
She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room .	4111.263218727764
But at least it shews , that she was serious in the object of her journey .	4737.991877804781
but , exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone .	104237.83145823228
Elizabeth quietly answered Undoubtedly ;	206805.7532224178
Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic ;	211578.7458320323
You must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course .	1338.2308999713568
I can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ;	18005.908726550937
Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming .	36018.11833359553
I dare say she will ;	2131.008409202755
But self , though it would intrude , could not engross her .	22329.855418782885
His temptation is not adequate to the risk .	72087.57023676361
a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point , without being resented .	41988.23264321973
Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal from the shire , as clearly as Gardiner could do .	9352.471852438966
To Bennet's acknowledgments he briefly replied , with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family ;	4929.909021888585
When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned , in terms of such mortifying , yet merited reproach , her sense of shame was severe .	6660.646208815054
He is now gone into the army , she added , but I am afraid he has turned out very wild .	807.6246982626149
and , after giving each of them an hasty kiss , hurried into the vestibule , where Jane , who came running down stairs from her mother's apartment , immediately met her .	20147.701773147855
Take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one .	2917.591191997131
I am most seriously displeased .	28299.436052555866
When they ascended the steps to the hall , Maria's alarm was every moment increasing , and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm .	10167.897796597947
My feelings will not be repressed .	32285.529869396196
Nor was Darcy's vindication , though grateful to her feelings , capable of consoling her for such discovery .	7009.853534324421
All that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds , secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ;	10506.43614142386
My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other .	15737.079997701685
She has known him only a fortnight .	11317.414159613196
I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being .	22612.477373074864
and Elizabeth , as they waited for the housekeeper , had leisure to wonder at her being where she was .	2653.2899421758852
Elizabeth , though expecting no less , thanked him with tears of gratitude ;	56971.58413706738
I am sick of them all .	483.4445367157485
You shall not , for the sake of one individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that selfishness is prudence , and insensibility of danger , security for happiness .	14394.954197951964
Elizabeth now began to revive .	93984.28176600709
She received him with her very best politeness , which he returned with as much more , apologising for his intrusion , without any previous acquaintance with her , which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice .	7198.352544977479
Very nonsensical to come at all !	76875.86097081628
Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to identify , do copyright research on , transcribe and proofread public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm collection .	66277.23332594278
From that moment I observed my friend's behaviour attentively ;	207508.0023898603
One enjoyment was certain that of suitableness as companions ;	93850.44890175619
And if I am that choice , why may not I accept him ?	16944.134917308478
D The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you can do with this work .	5489.493013359667
Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival , that Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine ;	5650.090147542508
Elizabeth smiled .	11199.713028407246
Such doings discomposed Bennet exceedingly .	71077.98368141346
My sister , who is more than ten years my junior , was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew , Colonel Fitzwilliam , and myself .	3212.820722106244
It suddenly struck her that it might be from lady Catherine ;	11984.18569789428
E8 .	6847.919774710029
Let Wickham be your man .	68029.83403654351
She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it .	17529.860157248844
At last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance of Darcy , with such a smile over the face , as she remembered to have sometimes seen , when he looked at her .	4231.870776267537
and whenever they changed their quarters , either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to , for some little assistance towards discharging their bills .	32098.02224976667
But I must write no more .	3553.7157647032554
and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation .	50131.98053509008
Write to me very often , my dear .	11213.258277614854
She could see him instantly before her , in every charm of air and address ;	24102.198562235633
But , really , I know not what to say .	651.579185106878
and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it , to Ramsgate ;	32897.41518355015
His plan did not vary on seeing them .	15013.170672807582
Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ?	17103.353054399566
just enough to make one good sort of man ;	5769.077887612148
and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been ;	19396.17070870323
Poor Jane !	58793.90828038285
The more I see of the world , the more am I dissatisfied with it ;	11800.511860344279
He and his sisters were well , I hope , when you left London .	6760.88145087415
International donations are gratefully accepted , but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States .	18773.891210277943
CHAPTER III .	1575.3856872474946
Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect , that the sight of such rooms , so many servants , and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them .	17572.43627555869
Don't keep coughing so , Kitty , for heaven's sake !	58318.95438739606
Under such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief .	4121.896017723174
and at that moment she felt , that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something !	4650.198904033076
Lord , how ashamed I should be of not being married before three and twenty !	7035.691054034827
She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure .	41608.71546831148
nor could she for many hours , learn to think of it less than incessantly .	3945.1645808279263
You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness ;	92145.2930040326
His consenting to marry her is a proof , I will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking .	3287.7973657841026
To-morrow fortnight .	134147.08119236372
but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other , of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that Denny had brought him from London , and that he was to have a lieutenant's commission in the shire .	2835.319005544347
It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way .	2919.256476661347
My youngest of all , is lately married , and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds , walking with a young man , who I believe will soon become a part of the family .	5826.047326194838
They were then , with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance , taken into the house ;	8172.520790204706
But Elizabeth , who had not the least inclination to remain with them , laughingly answered , No , no ;	7788.031928924661
and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement .	18505.821325135912
All field sports were over .	71369.04065420947
My style of writing is very different from yours .	73384.30716339489
c .	6937.161746028588
and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror , Gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power .	14626.641038346783
Thus , we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition .	40092.8687152356
She wrote even to Jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her former professions of regard .	7038.922243259267
CHAPTER X The day passed much as the day before had done .	12894.29224532369
He merely added , that he should not write again , till he had something of importance to mention .	1515.1805393295228
It originated in Gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support , and consequently preferred her husband's .	23712.141315570654
After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with It is your turn to say something now , Darcy .	16502.556125578772
and his commendation of every thing would have touched Bennet's heart , but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property .	31924.20151194924
She comes to us to-day .	50383.973300525424
I will not tell you what it is .	580.079620856883
At length however Bennet had no more to say ;	1142.7636159597666
The power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor , and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance .	17697.971276728957
Then turning to Bennet , he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon .	32451.503658632457
The subjection in which his father had brought him up , had given him originally great humility of manner , but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head , living in retirement , and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity .	13161.75325997393
From the entrance hall , of which Collins pointed out , with a rapturous air , the fine proportion and finished ornaments , they followed the servants through an anti-chamber , to the room where Lady Catherine , her daughter , and Jenkinson were sitting .	25329.264269786974
and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over .	3308.7781268559875
Now , said she , that this first meeting is over , I feel perfectly easy .	2279.5981234925075
The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited .	9036.23183853326
After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight , and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear ;	23694.93860262317
What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy ?	6141.284739780963
Lydia was exceedingly fond of him .	9451.88189238856
When coffee was over , Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him ;	19481.903657033294
I do not believe she often sees such at home .	4088.413527825336
A clergyman like you must marry .	9564.529417567583
But gracious me !	39069.64000560143
It was agreed to .	3074.6225275778597
But she would not be secure .	4310.642040943806
Though I shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ;	28025.80228367364
You are so strange !	13818.073069957672
Having resolved to do it without loss of time , as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday , and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment , he set about it in a very orderly manner , with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business .	10871.246274406
E GARDINER .	71009.29376211051
For my own part , she rejoined , I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her .	11202.971912421905
and in the evening Bennet's invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter .	13970.105861183629
Yes , always , she replied , without knowing what she said , for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , I remember hearing you once say , Darcy , that you hardly ever forgave , that your resentment once created was unappeasable .	9469.275608907914
my sweetest Lizzy !	61476.78822757935
And I think you will agree with me , in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece's .	25726.242023817453
Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations ;	20705.312663473906
CHAPTER XVIII .	1403.50908934543
F6 .	1376184.626012499
that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her , and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening .	3373.4453989493873
CHAPTER III .	1575.3856872474946
What a charming amusement for young people this is , Darcy !	12307.26332383506
I remember , as soon as ever I saw him , when he first came into Hertfordshire last year , I thought how likely it was that you should come together .	2091.3447395248563
But it is all , all too late now .	4039.2230622855527
and Bennet found , with amazement and horror , that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter .	27566.285644159776
She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse , but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other , and how formal and cold was their manner , whenever they did .	5007.897229186966
No one who has ever seen you together , can doubt his affection .	51806.35080694473
Elizabeth listened as little as she could , but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name .	5778.5450621174
that it should be equally unreserved was impossible .	3422.8997164562784
It is because he will not give himself the trouble .	39586.31140192407
Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself , and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam , Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word I say .	4719.0823347335845
He is perfectly well behaved , polite , and unassuming , said her uncle .	6782.316182379342
You have reduced him to his present state of poverty , comparative poverty .	93073.18775498187
Nearly three weeks .	19841.914408823457
Oh !	3082.833849588038
His appearance was greatly in his favour ;	30577.493152990028
I have sent for you on an affair of importance .	16101.999760188766
When to these recollections was added the developement of Wickham's character , it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before , were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful .	36974.949410759276
but Ashworth is too far off !	55664.35732007943
She now lost every expectation of pleasure .	24724.700137870284
Miss Bennet , replied her ladyship , in an angry tone , you ought to know , that I am not to be trifled with .	619.2311139471207
for I consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman .	16250.745506928624
On reaching the spacious lobby above , they were shewn into a very pretty sitting-room , lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below ;	47672.2744860805
You know pretty well , I suppose , what has been done for the young people .	2331.165999554155
At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted .	23329.35793571857
I never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong .	44010.93623442297
Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible .	14062.959854178327
Elizabeth silently attended her .	47485.231792286075
Oh , Jane , take care .	3341.012430914062
Oh !	3082.833849588038
' But afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time .	26616.995376235074
She examined into their employments , looked at their work , and advised them to do it differently ;	63555.718117486926
CHAPTER XI .	1403.50908934543
unless you looked up to him as a superior .	24224.62114362191
I have therefore made up my mind to tell you , that I do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare .	7657.270246966081
and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William , in which she was readily joined by Jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of Collins , and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London .	8177.372816108703
Who do you mean , my dear ?	2329.286097521285
Though Bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage .	2401.635702129767
how can it affect them ?	25546.044673288467
They had nothing to accuse him of but pride ;	2422.1459158518337
He was coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland : when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey .	4683.329578088757
Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game , except when Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh's being too hot or too cold , or having too much or too little light .	41218.7114535397
but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future .	5962.495950345083

He scarcely ever spoke to her , and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself , were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas , whose civility in listening to him , was a seasonable relief to them all , and especially to her friend .	2351.3933738597243
CHAPTER VIII .	1403.50908934543
When at length they arose to take leave , Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn ;	8879.724736098578
I could see him with perfect indifference , but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of .	1085.946476727993
I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes .	5965.676026679502
and the two , who were most anxiously expected , to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen , were in very good time .	5767.56883384719
No one but Bennet , regretted that their stay would be so short ;	28596.38001888753
Lydia has no brothers to step forward ;	79378.69879686082
CHAPTER XII .	1403.50908934543
Well , mamma , said she , when they were all returned to the breakfast room , and what do you think of my husband ?	305.1292939290817
'Tis as good as a Lord !	92092.6709461842
forgive the question are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ?	16040.15014444039
and therefore gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent , his actions were capable of a very different construction ;	4876.6561319572775
But what is that to me ?	4125.475797057112
a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade .	107049.38654996008
To fortune I am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since I am well aware that it could not be complied with ;	7738.348081408851
Girls , can I do any thing for you in Meryton ?	31737.15666732614
[ Illustration : Morning Dress .	23496.442401933655
But the wife of Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation , that she could , upon the whole , have no cause to repine .	8116.948374103588
Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table , and they went up stairs together .	3016.43090537837
Your alliance will be a disgrace ;	10035.901360898346
I have every reason in the world to think ill of you .	2144.4438070365964
Elizabeth immediately recognising the livery , guessed what it meant , and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations , by acquainting them with the honour which she expected .	46142.164655133456
At present , indeed , they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood ;	14024.53292099764
The world has been deceived in that respect ;	48403.82290906918
Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility ;	8160.459872264487
He must write his own sermons ;	87009.0331494389
which will not be yours till after your mother's decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to .	22428.20014658276
She stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation , and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery .	60429.42611113611
Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ?	73175.29316283202
Miss Darcy's praise occupied the chief of it .	5312.247053244144
Recovering himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said , Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of .	10772.188965039282
Is her husband , is the son of his late father's steward , to be his brother ?	5867.6181794062695
Lady Catherine approached , and , after listening for a few minutes , said to Darcy , Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss , if she practised more , and could have the advantage of a London master .	2542.518581866318
but Sir William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane , who were dancing together .	8366.911928790953
How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell , but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you .	13717.324435691213
Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother .	5197.401708901148
Certainly , replied Elizabeth there are such people , but I hope I am not one of them .	1288.3569494001706
See paragraph 1 .	14647.793797913855
I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did .	13563.244759842079
Had his own happiness , however , been the only sacrifice , he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best ;	6317.980844024258
And with a bow to Darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room .	6260.439881609308
She would not betray her trust , I suppose , without bribery and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be found .	6720.888929027451
but they were now necessary , and she assured him with some confusion , of her attachment to Darcy .	5873.178667175076
All was acknowledged , and half the night spent in conversation .	24270.55824416936
If we are ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been , said Elizabeth , and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what Gardiner has done for them , because Wickham has not sixpence of his own .	14964.822391786533
Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father .	66857.93352178589
Hunsford , near Westerham , Kent , 15th October .	322900.5873419373
Bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from London , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time .	4216.013128806763
and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life .	13065.73442816456
I would keep a pack of foxhounds , and drink a bottle of wine every day .	32711.31549600785
Now , seriously , what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence ?	16420.40583054093
and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to elope with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ;	18115.48917416759
Must it be so ?	38084.782286574045
These bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had I with greater policy concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified , unalloyed inclination ;	41670.18490596762
I hope she will turn out well .	9350.858112761196
Teaze him laugh at him .	94024.83976749759
She danced four dances with him at Meryton ;	20152.829301727812
While the contents of the first letter remained on her mind , she was all surprise all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl , whom it was impossible he could marry for money ;	9565.500031371235
Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start , and before he could recover himself enough to speak , she , in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's situation , hastily exclaimed , I beg your pardon , but I must leave you .	10579.598771412466
I know not , Miss Elizabeth , said he , whether Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us , but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it .	2436.079196153332
And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection .	8796.21275312316
Any place would do , of about three or four hundred a year ;	51407.42237358542
The note was immediately dispatched , and its contents as quickly complied with .	21363.359454300975
and when it closed , Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon Charlotte's degree of contentment , to understand her address in guiding , and composure in bearing with her husband , and to acknowledge that it was all done very well .	18504.17683782754
But no letter appeared , and she was completely puzzled .	12940.774174096689
This was a lucky idea of mine , indeed !	4580.385205437425
but it is not sound .	7628.680094238953
What is his name ?	17226.608956358014
Reynolds , either from pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister .	6669.000191787542
Her look and manners were open , cheerful and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and I remained convinced from the evening's scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment .	15740.592774216704
Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer , and forced his younger sister to be civil also , and say what the occasion required .	22210.980926679073
Every thing that is charming !	22259.07190950365
and after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do , which was the more probable from the time of year .	6740.464050296134
Brother-in-law of Wickham !	130485.99999999978
Happy shall I be , when his stay at Netherfield is over !	226468.4803925719
Miss Darcy was tall , and on a larger scale than Elizabeth ;	18620.560875323186
At present we have nothing to guide us .	13935.782913602357
The account of his connection with the Pemberley family , was exactly what he had related himself ;	5840.979497515659
Your sisters are engaged , and there is not another woman in the room , whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with .	3849.151958637425
When I wrote that letter , replied Darcy , I believed myself perfectly calm and cool , but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit .	5827.623623433287
The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth , as the first .	5742.4372771358785
We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Wickham with money .	18336.261039011766
As soon as they had driven from the door , Elizabeth was called on by her cousin , to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings , which , for Charlotte's sake , she made more favourable than it really was .	1551.264924839912
They may wish many things besides his happiness ;	36091.52808193217
I must conclude , for I cannot be long from my poor mother .	9987.6083345859
cried Elizabeth , brightening up for a moment .	2386.272554994175
But however he did not .	3047.690393006497
Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Hurst or Miss Bingley ;	44957.22829028491
Your friend performs delightfully ;	253622.38577093315
and the valley , here contracted into a glen , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it .	28385.17446109814
They could talk of nothing but officers ;	11886.794223018453
Their conduct has been such , replied Elizabeth , as neither you , nor I , nor any body , can ever forget .	12735.51070515113
She had obtained private intelligence that Darcy did not wish for cards ;	41982.39316532118
why is not every body as happy ?	34177.74050160044
nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable .	4177.256333868375
He had never before supposed that , could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter , it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself , as by the present arrangement .	3647.3143930953343
Kitty stared at him , and Lydia exclaimed .	25047.48364129996
Elizabeth could not help saying , It is very much to his credit , I am sure , that you should think so .	455.91290107717856
On their being joined by Bingley himself , Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas ;	30202.03492080939
Wickham passed all his youth there , you know .	18708.326953763968
As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , I shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females .	21699.532439111943
Very little was said by either ;	25370.942464789405
repeated Elizabeth , in utter amazement .	43155.6205897574
her liveliness had been never worse timed .	249823.37404638145
Perhaps it will be as well , if you discourage his coming here so very often .	8768.871657256945
CHAPTER V Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate .	40374.57016672657
She retreated from the window , fearful of being seen ;	33689.63002202808
he sustained it however with fortitude , and so far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into conversation with Gardiner .	3050.378920920574
She shared in their attendance on Bennet , and was a great comfort to them , in their hours of freedom .	5309.283593033668
Does he know his real character ?	27230.746750432718
In her kind schemes for Elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam .	22906.141765112654
We shall often meet , I hope , in Hertfordshire .	3037.9334244313545
replied Kitty , it looks just like that man that used to be with him before .	41324.469864424536
If you were to give me forty such men , I never could be so happy as you .	3287.3114496305525
She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious , made no other reply to Elizabeth's salutation , than a slight inclination of the head , and sat down without saying a word .	3197.042862713461
He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever , on the occasion .	4137.864526106052
What is to become of us !	3865.3334011864026
It was kindly meant .	12116.641304141558
Lydia declared herself satisfied .	67261.95390874906
My sister , I am sure , will not hear of her removal .	1880.8686841750684
The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities , though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings ;	23685.440642081718
If it was not for the entail I should not mind it .	719.2568614004066
And then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it .	1129.671365588469
They have some of the finest woods in the country .	4972.163513498361
Oh !	3082.833849588038
What did you say of me , that I did not deserve ?	2956.8295325375793
You forget that I have made no answer .	1155.621999076926
Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility .	34209.50002370565
Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied , Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully .	8021.2118550485475
I know not what to think .	160.09729956976727
Bennet could not give her consent , or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , though she talked to Bingley of nothing else , for half an hour ;	5720.14392634295
She knew not what to think , nor how to account for it .	625.4952926471028
So much the better .	290.9841751384544
You wanted me , I know , to say 'Yes , ' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste ;	9221.082486048073
It is admirable !	47206.37392245624
They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which I cannot wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects .	17359.253419443172
pride he probably had , and if not , it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town , where the family did not visit .	60555.1919622565
But , Lizzy , you can tell us whether it is like or not .	5738.9084909831645
and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's dying an old maid .	24794.98769697643
The wisest and the best of men , nay , the wisest and best of their actions , may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke .	20944.91843134543
Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper ;	43725.4929573714
and it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning , and never said a word about it till now .	529.1771598273535
After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room , from the sideboard to the fender , to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London , Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden , which was large and well laid out , and to the cultivation of which he attended himself .	6027.678985920285
I should infinitely prefer a book .	8231.989418585215
but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless Darcy returned within the stated time .	48891.832886696335
This is not to be borne .	4078.2502007604267
Had his first appearance , or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining , been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Darcy , the gardener's expression of surprise , on beholding his master , must immediately have told it .	29222.959395190537
Hurst had therefore nothing to do , but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep .	22167.799109052503
I thought it would never be over ;	959.5766509199842
But if I do not take your likeness now , I may never have another opportunity .	5745.448797349538
Elizabeth made no answer , and walked on , her heart swelling with indignation .	1272.6026980968486
And do you like her ?	6300.098271479264
It was an evening of no common delight to them all ;	2867.537265894634
I never can be thankful , Bennet , for any thing about the entail .	6497.674010887785
Were the same fair prospect to arise at present , as had flattered them a year ago , every thing , she was persuaded , would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion .	5743.9761625281235
He danced only four dances !	192765.73980027912
I have not a doubt of Bingley's sincerity , said Elizabeth warmly ;	4356.546433903667
Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother , on his approaching marriage , were all that was affectionate and insincere .	6609.081245434769
Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort .	37174.55145186971
He likes to have his own way very well , replied Colonel Fitzwilliam .	13699.888414871983
It was painful , exceedingly painful , to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return .	8328.97876541538
Yes , thought Elizabeth , that would be a delightful scheme , indeed , and completely do for us at once .	1560.7282389441034
but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off .	47772.94554349069
said he hastily , as he opened the door .	910.5768248426376
She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own , but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action , she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage .	10295.970904812593
As often as I can .	10704.64302110931
If you love Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham , you must be very happy .	1665.4976802445424
She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas .	1089.156241015884
Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming , without changing colour .	1630.337616530128
1 .	4079.0161042043856
You may depend on it , replied the other , for Nicholls was in Meryton last night ;	3245.077873603707
and she could hardly suppress a smile , at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had revolted , in his offer to herself .	6616.031940347775
I told Collins so before you came .	12058.602633191247
I knew , said he , that what I wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary .	2763.6732703361827
Why did not you seek legal redress ?	16951.436408446567
When they repaired to the dining-room , Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place , which , in all their former parties , had belonged to him , by her sister .	4223.27513361041
It was necessary to laugh , when she would rather have cried .	6597.821815897363
Soon after you left me on Saturday , I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were .	3765.5504828058047
but I always speak what I think .	2320.7205812598168
And rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had not Collins thus addressed her , When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ;	9798.241272165687
But that is nothing to us .	503.5930591995341
Our distress , my dear Lizzy , is very great .	5701.319479398086
Not that I mean to find fault with you , for such things I know are all chance in this world .	27807.95469905442
I never saw such capacity , and taste , and application , and elegance , as you describe , united .	13439.63410134245
the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice .	61775.19633604829
found fault with the arrangement of the furniture , or detected the housemaid in negligence ;	100103.62611108029
How can you contrive to write so even ?	35304.51825711341
that my dear mother had more command over herself ;	40288.164886183484
The two first dances , however , brought a return of distress ;	10936.746761774273
The room in which the ladies sat was backwards .	89565.05546423727
My father's opinion of me does me the greatest honour ;	48095.85242247295
It may be easily believed , that however little of novelty could be added to their fears , hopes , and conjectures , on this interesting subject , by its repeated discussion , no other could detain them from it long , during the whole of the journey .	18495.61915461127
but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption !	16420.851271363557
The coach , therefore , took them the first stage of their journey , and brought its master back to Longbourn .	9839.125133693775
cried Jane , what do you mean , Sir ?	1124.440812244552
for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Darcy's steward , and of that , I can assure you , he informed me himself .	2197.580642343404
Her figure was elegant , and she walked well ;	39855.61914024231
I have faults enough , but they are not , I hope , of understanding .	2789.5653850306126
but she could not approve him ;	2943.9400637065723
and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so full of contradictions and varieties , sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance , and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination .	17112.00142201687
Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections ?	45866.736130508
CHAPTER I It is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune , must be in want of a wife .	2471.445510242864
I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then Georgiana , unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me .	15736.740192991694
It is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married , continued her mother , but at the same time , Bingley , it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me .	321.97129759313407
And in the first place , let us hear what has happened to you all , since you went away .	284.53082444245916
Besides , it will not much signify what one wears this summer , after the shire have left Meryton , and they are going in a fortnight .	7264.149524519152
His debts are to be paid , amounting , I believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her , and his commission purchased .	4200.485291572781
He dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday .	17872.604763015057
Her mother's ungraciousness , made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind ;	5949.996766788038
But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes .	7132.096789777008
You are rather disposed to call his interference officious ?	81095.57990175321
and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go , she did not seem to ask for compassion .	5695.18013942668
Whilst wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and Elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of Darcy approaching them , and at no great distance .	5493.537330570806
At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here .	12131.276863071176
and it was but the other day , that I recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her .	1517.9246772916833
We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side , said Jane : I hope and trust they will yet be happy .	6112.183282932957
that she had a new gown , or a new parasol , which she would have described more fully , but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry , as Forster called her , and they were going to the camp ;	3978.548782643578
If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement , I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one .	11622.72043701142
And pray may I ask ?	2334.9901792485107
I should never be happy without him , so think it no harm to be off .	6289.654112883698
have you heard from my uncle ?	5904.780273389959
He repeated the question , with some surprise at her silence .	22902.338099638528
and a report soon followed that Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly .	25938.451590742905
for she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening , although utterly unknown to her before .	4831.602251295872
and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry her , had she been his relation .	965.8843647381273
As for your Elizabeth's picture , you must not attempt to have it taken , for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes ?	19699.995307663165
It would have suited me in every respect .	6539.5414095113365
He immediately offered to fetch her others ;	22463.720897995874
I ought not to have said a word about it .	897.5987001170126
His father was an excellent man , said Gardiner .	10545.553599134026
One ought not to repine ;	72668.3190460484
I cannot catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as I often see done .	18553.060614485017
She was not sorry , however , to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung .	4095.1152679344136
the other is Charlotte's marriage .	67532.45398586815
But you How are you ?	5904.267384914949
He danced only four dances , though gentlemen were scarce ;	167689.66709064454
Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ;	7614.735919116806
Good gracious !	1373.0350778783054
I am more likely to want time than courage , Elizabeth .	13661.111822629844
And though he exclaimed at the term , she found that it had been pretty much the case .	6931.617623821621
and continually was she repeating , Why is he so altered ?	152956.0940388311
You may well warn me against such an evil .	4064.6963016682043
They were of course all intending to be surprised ;	5044.594114013094
my head is always full of something else .	12927.385849525946
She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an inmate of Darcy's house , and mentioned with raptures , some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture .	16904.616825029447
This however was no evil to Elizabeth , and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough ;	20034.325524191423
He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before , on his reading Collins's letter ;	12363.599101218673
Jane , cried Elizabeth , was there a servant belonging to it , who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ?	1621.6250490277928
They travelled as expeditiously as possible ;	23714.639268812287
You are a very strange creature by way of a friend !	12694.996924687095
When Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed , which certainly was not unseldom , she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte .	46014.953561689676
The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity ;	14332.56680909689
Your tempers are by no means unlike .	73004.77751729696
and , after receiving her answer , asked in an hesitating manner how long Darcy had been staying there .	25354.327759931006
His being so sure of succeeding , was wrong , said she ;	16777.26585135956
Allow me to say , Lady Catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application , have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged .	6207.651658522317
GARDINER .	130486.00000000001
and before he went away , an engagement was formed , chiefly through his own and Bennet's means , for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband .	5938.155172862718
you cannot go yourself .	78521.37589544593
That Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham , before his arrival , but without gaining any satisfactory information ;	27916.532642903003
They were in fact very fine ladies ;	11756.673410631089
Well , any friend of Bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure ;	18516.646425716837
Come , let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly .	16275.147758726178
I am , dear Sir , c .	1429.8871080249562
or , as the happiest alternative , been secluded from the world , in some distant farm house .	13599.544032549196
And how impossible in others !	203306.46309671295
but of the truth of what I shall relate , I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity .	24888.417708926892
Nay , if you are so serious about it , I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled .	7329.092800614855
Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity , a warmth , a delight , which words could but poorly express .	106342.63413060641
At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ;	1450.466970996621
but from what the report of their engagement could originate , Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ;	11522.551460996614
my dear brother , replied Bennet , that is exactly what I could most wish for .	3179.449858210301
Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude , but said nothing .	1215.2798804068723
it is very hard to think that she might have been Collins's wife by this time , had not it been for her own perverseness .	1519.1008933848793
He could not speak a word for full ten minutes .	2507.1133661408344
If this be the case , he deserves you .	7482.732799708174
His attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect ;	104025.21202816378
It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast ;	10919.427414689593
I am sure you will be very comfortable there .	1538.1354254641992
At length the Parsonage was discernible .	30196.74268728722
so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as your's seems to have been .	22506.070070323556
I am afraid you will be angry .	215.8694181035161
He certainly looked at her friend a great deal , but the expression of that look was disputable .	10272.719203104822
She was less handsome than her brother , but there was sense and good humour in her face , and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle .	4990.416449008178
London : Printed for T Egerton , Military Library , Whitehall .	18.98976343759161
and she parted from him convinced , that whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing .	22371.13780250496
I often tell my other girls they are nothing to her .	12151.055441014187
Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction and a moment's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible , she sat down again , and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion .	16534.571524686202
I am not afraid of you , said he , smilingly .	691.436101368441
I do not think it is very pretty ;	520.004893132629
Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he ?	4152.898035618906
1 .	4079.0161042043856
but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing , and between herself and Elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to .	7500.925759270098
MY DEAR NIECE , I have just received your letter , and shall devote this whole morning to answering it , as I foresee that a little writing will not comprise what I have to tell you .	8722.617959992243
and , though Kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense , since the disturbers of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended , was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance , by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp .	35121.15940024833
That is capital , added her sister , and they both laughed heartily .	17840.358938358208
Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer , as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces .	14745.943973708801
The girls grieved over such a number of ladies ;	16976.743524034016
said Elizabeth .	1787.5588027056042
Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity , are not worth a regret .	25172.358092741968
It is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and interest , for him to be guilty of it .	1740.9132384901588
What a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago , would now have been gladly and gratefully received !	19868.475826028414
and I understand from Gardiner , that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all , before she leaves the South .	5167.857251854431
said that she had liked him better when they met in Kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning .	2657.2891163109834
We are speaking of music , Madam , said he , when no longer able to avoid a reply .	830.8188059667888
and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you .	3662.9523818018824
They are descended on the maternal side , from the same noble line ;	52606.04881474368
And is this all ?	18040.134666530666
They have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression .	16118.97778880515
The boy protested that she should not ;	29017.658166921923
Bennet accepted the challenge , observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements .	66584.69830887829
They have at least that advantage .	10889.802942088301
It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge ;	2499.37383742441
My father began life in the profession which your uncle , Philips , appears to do so much credit to but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late Darcy , and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property .	7172.159179570489
That will not do for a compliment to Darcy , Caroline , cried her brother because he does not write with ease .	1544.2895813093173
Adieu .	761700.4831990508
you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner .	56260.7269356663
but intricate characters are the most amusing .	60146.77632465024
grieved shocked .	130486.00000000001
This , she would not hear of ;	1219.2954821720552
It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity ;	47969.0492859836
Hope was over , entirely over ;	41210.263045989326
F3 .	7079.122622599643
She longed to enquire of the housekeeper , whether her master were really absent , but had not courage for it .	7761.2760554563
Darcy was punctual in his return , and as Lydia informed you , attended the wedding .	14669.32030067329
It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's interested wishes , and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes , however openly or artfully spoken , could influence a young man so totally independent of every one .	22621.06177216889
I will speak to her about it myself directly .	8071.766677565324
Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley ;	3847.3825144330654
and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand .	7143.017249310657
The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new , yet I think it is well expressed .	17031.540725795163
The supposition did not pain her .	56275.09804020996
Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense .	34726.58076501639
The latter was thinking only of his breakfast .	14323.371627003704
Their father then went to the library to write , and the girls walked into the breakfast-room .	4750.211442390993
and then , what do you think we did ?	1546.0800533318884
he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it ;	5134.995083114307
and , after a pause of several minutes , was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion , who , in a manner , which though it spoke compassion , spoke likewise restraint , said , I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing , concern .	7056.270643771102
and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added , I have never had a cross word from him in my life , and I have known him ever since he was four years old .	1795.5871770753718
Wherever you and Jane are known , you must be respected and valued ;	23347.59353965961
but Darcy can please where he chuses .	34186.581992596926
Only think of that my dear ;	1726.8514679881391
and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room , its aspect and its furniture , he addressed himself particularly to her , as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him .	7305.924715421679
They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends , and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family , when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window , and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle , driving up the street .	4704.593688487344
But it ought to be done , and if you will give me a sheet of paper , it shall be done directly .	461.88452987554484
The least agreeable circumstance in the business , was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet , whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person .	7990.35961921553
And that , said Reynolds , pointing to another of the miniatures , is my master and very like him .	30541.958827262297
I should not be surprised , said Darcy , if he were to give it up , as soon as any eligible purchase offers .	1267.067582788584
I thought him very sly ;	76524.84420344954
When is your turn to come ?	65357.29816687025
'Lady Catherine , ' said she , 'you have given me a treasure .	19188.384954287078
I shall never forget her appearance this morning .	2488.709912040361
But no , recollecting herself , that could never be : my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me : I should not have been allowed to invite them .	2463.4989437290496
We passed each other several times .	65483.64543961686
When they all removed to Brighton , therefore , you had no reason , I suppose , to believe them fond of each other .	1099.0501128109825
Her reflections were in general satisfactory .	82727.26609075959
The officers will find women better worth their notice .	40341.2732590181
E2 .	1376184.626012499
Let us sit down .	18108.86198871174
With your good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others !	14738.705498323521
While Sir William was with them , Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig , and shewing him the country ;	26541.721625359216
she felt all the compliment it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother .	1339.4380642806498
You have sense , and we all expect you to use it .	14707.836703977193
Their other engagements were few ;	94221.84175568107
Change of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home , may be as useful as anything .	45662.86739248917
Oh yes !	40057.924186037235
I often think , said she , that there is nothing so bad as parting with one's friends .	1873.451602415943
Mary had neither genius nor taste ;	97707.80594735817
1813 .	6847.919774710029
You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner in such society ;	22328.863818497615
and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character , in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of Elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end .	8345.102796334817
Elizabeth , for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts , now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since her coming away .	13677.366093508495
repeated Bennet .	67089.20013841403
but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment , had they sat in one equally lively ;	13468.106306249432
Oh !	3082.833849588038
She paused , and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse .	61445.80236508254
And to be kept back on such a motive !	26842.772690061367
