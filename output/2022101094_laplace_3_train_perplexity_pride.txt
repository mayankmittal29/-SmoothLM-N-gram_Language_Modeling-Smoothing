Average perplexity: 5107.4960291224825
I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner .	4309.465679813559
and to him she had hardly courage to speak .	4407.9123172857235
At that ball , while I had the honour of dancing with you , I was first made acquainted , by Sir William Lucas's accidental information , that Bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage .	3265.0112041353327
My aunt Philips came to Longbourn on Tuesday , after my father went away ;	4280.82717419165
Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Robinson ;	6676.82137187537
I should take him , even on my slight acquaintance , to be an ill-tempered man .	3451.399989231826
The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret .	3772.3062023544694
That is all very proper and civil , I am sure , said Bennet , and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman .	1603.800427114402
When I went away , I felt that it would soon happen .	3849.8501408834973
and she felt capable under such circumstances , of endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters .	3709.232743163494
But that is not the case here .	4545.780048707611
Such I was , from eight to eight and twenty ;	7290.244503985444
and so extremely accomplished for her age !	5605.901176457206
or at least it was impossible not to try for information .	5013.553878227048
Nor I , I am sure , said Miss Bingley .	2296.876557885898
The day passed most pleasantly away ;	6362.019536386293
There has been many a one , I fancy , overcome in the same way .	4364.883298783189
It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week .	3544.7062016857776
for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know , and read great books , and make extracts .	4073.2155541351744
and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon , was such an instance of Lady Catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough .	3118.1575038829974
She was quite amazed at her own discomposure ;	4963.181676156237
How abominable !	15295.86788635124
After a few minutes reflection , however , she continued , I do remember his boasting one day , at Netherfield , of the implacability of his resentments , of his having an unforgiving temper .	2652.527804946394
Elizabeth again , and more seriously assured her of its truth .	4139.219630361118
and the effort which the formation , and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read .	2893.549548483743
these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce ;	6305.863154642289
and I have enquired of every body too , who is likely to know .	2874.244241421682
Here was knowledge in which no one could partake ;	7732.295466478456
C below .	22421.855171372856
The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents , about a twelvemonth ago , was now brought forward again .	3393.103729639601
but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine .	4591.361815670375
Since her being at Lambton , she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud ;	4702.637400532065
and oh !	9795.004766726765
Did you see it ?	8025.437805832556
I must be in town next Saturday .	4197.462406695121
A lady's imagination is very rapid ;	8619.119623114293
They stood for some time without speaking a word ;	5003.804245829648
The morrow produced no abatement of Bennet's ill humour or ill health .	5574.623963341245
He had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them ;	3454.593593039502
She told the story however with great spirit among her friends ;	5443.143793882721
How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter !	6141.439291027952
If I had known as much this morning , I certainly would not have called on him .	3254.7822144930137
The old lady is Jenkinson , who lives with them .	4113.430240396715
At least , therefore , I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies .	3409.323531572534
Bennet , in equal silence , was enjoying the scene .	5272.87978884366
That his two sisters and Darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough , and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable .	2782.4825592639904
I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous elopement .	3608.7961080804826
and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and forwarded , as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side .	2597.5711254998378
and the beautiful pyramids of grapes , nectarines , and peaches , soon collected them round the table .	3947.991338077712
Transcriber's note : Spelling and hyphen changes have been made so that there is consistency within the book .	5510.752484939165
But I must tell you how it went off .	3820.238851302445
He bore it however with admirable calmness .	6332.139284219436
To be sure , you knew no actual good of me but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love .	4011.282512727488
Why should they try to influence him ?	6613.1162107413475
His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others , as in his reproaches to myself .	3801.0975277643493
and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own , it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance .	3051.8800263764706
Elizabeth was not surprised at it , as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill .	3668.0789395869374
that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation , than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance .	3879.7709820130717
You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas .	4401.847816912552
People do not die of little trifling colds .	9150.294525133673
With all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it , am I wrong , my dearest Jane , in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many ?	3753.140617162712
And then we were so merry all the way home !	5139.551079090756
Indeed , Mama , you are mistaken , said Elizabeth , blushing for her mother .	3059.168167690014
I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat .	4560.305761193082
and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley .	2994.691481869344
No , indeed , I did not .	2669.538069086717
Darcy's letter , she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart .	4285.59017405456
I cannot think so very ill of Wickham .	3261.5325486410034
he actually danced with her twice ;	7954.703146569293
and Jane more especially , who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself , had she been the culprit , was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure .	3742.1299632090454
said Lydia stoutly , I am not afraid ;	4371.290462351465
and Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages .	3363.4922507250362
Lizzy , why am I thus singled from my family , and blessed above them all !	4846.2554363079
though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present , because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character .	3165.474033936943
The idea of Collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther , and he continued : My reasons for marrying are , first , that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances ( like myself ) to set the example of matrimony in his parish .	3044.59545359302
Upon my word !	10186.256553179373
and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , she could , perhaps , believe , that remaining partiality for her , might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned .	3033.936504333072
Her favourite walk , and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine , was along the open grove which edged that side of the park , where there was a nice sheltered path , which no one seemed to value but herself , and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity .	2917.8452604383547
I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear .	2735.7649959483642
And what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail ?	4396.703207965248
Widely different was the effect of a second perusal .	7739.847766379027
We will know where we have gone we will recollect what we have seen .	4724.284253972004
Her fellow-travellers the next day , were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable .	3480.2511313950104
And then when we came away it was such fun !	4994.332560132001
or rather he has not Wickham's countenance , for his features are perfectly good .	5669.083258191532
How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence , she could not imagine .	3591.19948127089
for at any rate , there seemed a gulf impassable between them .	4108.169088672986
and she told me that it was certain true .	3057.4560631401428
His regard for her was quite imaginary ;	7468.099913241591
and for the last half year , nay , for a twelvemonth , she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity .	3712.529914928858
Her astonishment , however , was extreme ;	4588.397870516189
This is the estimation in which you hold me !	5129.138604311195
when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them , and Elizabeth , looking earnestly in her face , was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever .	3281.354702245189
In short , my dear aunt , I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy ;	2646.3292114344554

What will become of me .	5403.225570548134
But do you always write such charming long letters to her , Darcy ?	3879.070901684891
But how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable ?	4210.098516305615
but checking himself , he added in a gayer tone , Is it in address that he improves ?	4512.991287285015
Professor Michael S Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone .	4662.44835936501
This account then is what he has received from Darcy .	5175.006340943138
They were interrupted by Miss Bennet , who came to fetch her mother's tea .	3439.2967063445403
and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity .	3914.7816842538314
she is not acting by design .	7432.175754626953
Jane was not happy .	7619.418481007293
Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers , and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed , or a really new muslin in a shop window , could recal them .	3249.1015426291046
it gives such an elegance to misfortune !	8242.531474084512
Other schemes too came into her head .	8008.786253843613
I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister .	3747.1560556575223
If I were as rich as Darcy , cried a young Lucas who came with his sisters , I should not care how proud I was .	3282.407522616707
I shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier .	4393.516741991471
though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm , at her lively , sportive , manner of talking to her brother .	4727.35664014357
1 .	9967.378404281952
Yes , madam , said Bennet , delighted to speak to a lady Catherine .	3134.079973080847
Pray , what is your age ?	8051.171975138354
And one of my own daughters .	5481.684976501737

I have been most highly gratified indeed , my dear Such very superior dancing is not often seen .	3000.929612990317
If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of , the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time , for from the day of the invitation , to the day of the ball , there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once .	2826.6470486515536
To this , Mary very gravely replied , Far be it from me , my dear sister , to depreciate such pleasures .	3382.8472772086425
In the evening , soon after Bennet withdrew to the library , she saw Darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme .	2887.9824812961147
She saw instantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage ;	4697.876641032821
Her answer was warmly in his favour .	6536.371506832147
Darcy made no answer , and seemed desirous of changing the subject .	3542.8530208069656
How are they even to be discovered ?	7286.9922830579735
She enquired after his sister , but could do no more .	3963.2850126460717
she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined in company with him four times .	3947.98956000066
Are you much acquainted with Darcy ?	7186.18590715115
We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton .	4600.180545771633
My object then , replied Darcy , was to shew you , by every civility in my power , that I was not so mean as to resent the past ;	3125.649995639665
How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains !	5385.296120216357
I mean , that no man in his senses , would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a-year during my life , and fifty after I am gone .	3876.9647135628825
You must not suspect me .	4069.803823767028
Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred , during their visit , as they returned , except what had particularly interested them both .	3892.6408255657075
Who would have thought it !	7569.916178827887
I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment .	2564.1874821820434
Our plain manner of living , our small rooms , and few domestics , and the little we see of the world , must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself ;	3329.7701792563903
You dare not , you cannot deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of dividing them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind .	3079.653295286079
When they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ;	3459.907991025201
Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow .	5703.341278282218
In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion , with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode , and the improvements it was receiving , he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them ;	2881.8771833464803
I will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away , and come back again .	3017.301573967171
Well , Lizzy , said Bennet one day , what is your opinion now of this sad business of Jane's ?	3080.3918230567115
But I hope you will not mind it : it is all for Jane's sake , you know ;	2562.456153420692
and it is that which makes the wonder .	4306.17364436625
She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought ;	4313.317849581035
Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment , nor were the other ladies often absent ;	3989.847353342776
Darcy danced only once with Hurst and once with Miss Bingley , declined being introduced to any other lady , and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room , speaking occasionally to one of his own party .	2722.7102276968167
and though his pride was hurt , he suffered in no other way .	3631.701953160095
The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master , who was coming down in a day or two , to shoot there for several weeks .	3247.0608296735168
There is a lady , it seems , a Younge , who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what .	2654.4743940436183
He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her ;	4042.7565048733063
He had not been long seated before he complimented Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters , said he had heard much of their beauty , but that , in this instance , fame had fallen short of the truth ;	3179.1518266188673
Miss Bingley was engrossed by Darcy , her sister scarcely less so ;	4035.5801588373006
They will have nothing else to do .	4149.188250254382
In point of composition , said Mary , his letter does not seem defective .	5497.323129374298
he was lively and unreserved , danced every dance , was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield .	4075.7104213093303
it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her .	3419.913578201465
That is his notion of christian forgiveness !	6312.988168421509
what hours of transport we shall spend !	9182.859029659967
Oh !	5043.244884590713
so much ease , with such perfect good breeding !	6807.6932679418815
Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness .	4662.182249616451
It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night .	3755.2052277967873
I cannot quite agree with you there .	4407.924929865236
it is just as he chooses .	7224.017547050836
I am not romantic you know .	2633.6591776569344
Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed , a mixture of pride and impertinence ;	4465.149625665675
She was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself ;	3246.1062875017647
But there are two things that I want very much to know : one is , how much money your uncle has laid down , to bring it about ;	4145.483111149829
but that is what a governess will prevent , and if I had known your mother , I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one .	2809.1812754677585
There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention , while she added , When I said that he improved on acquaintance , I did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement , but that from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood .	3222.6644839792216
Colonel Forster is a sensible man , and will keep her out of any real mischief ;	4322.755436450258
The reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as I have given above .	3281.033949481951
Both changed colour , one looked white , the other red .	7347.250854288681
It had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town ;	4087.0483415891676
but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended ;	3799.434782108766
Darcy !	12692.46521465058
Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far ;	7104.724227705396
though it had not occurred to me before .	5565.6564682135695
to own the truth , with Wickham !	8020.735346903603
Her hopes were answered ;	10260.368820993162
He was my godfather , and excessively attached to me .	3209.857711777721
Well , well , said he , do not make yourself unhappy .	2800.7089451553356
This is quite shocking !	7981.199853482827
How hard it is in some cases to be believed !	6597.731880683939
and he was always the sweetest-tempered , most generous-hearted , boy in the world .	2706.6220717555416
and after observing Collins for a few moments , he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh .	2888.2205998718723

and depend upon it , you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this , as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire .	2845.6177753828993
it must be so , while he retains the use of his reason .	4118.93210770346
Vain , ignorant , idle , and absolutely uncontrouled !	8018.577528386717
but Jane happened to look round , and happened to smile : it was decided .	4570.129093128585
And is it really true ?	7614.516122925884
The letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so .	3490.359507377039
Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters .	5260.422229486724
Collins !	20875.399171594156
Without a governess you must have been neglected .	6936.045772316251
Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening , but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine , and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time .	2543.08343717208

for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her .	2638.054484172146
after honestly telling her what she thought , she thus went on : You are too sensible a girl , Lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are warned against it ;	3606.8102380839314
And so , Darcy did every thing ;	5113.923483402464

said he , smiling .	7200.378398824529
Gardiner did not write again , till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster ;	5242.704744543451
But before they heard again from Gardiner , a letter arrived for their father , from a different quarter , from Collins ;	3803.551788434455
how acutely did she now feel it .	5828.922689172777
cried Jane .	11598.000144140928
I never heard any thing so abominable .	4529.373099826501
It was at Sir William Lucas's , where a large party were assembled .	3879.2321129307934
but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield , and leave the next generation to purchase .	3106.1281810615524
Her father had most cruelly mortified her , by what he said of Darcy's indifference , and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that perhaps , instead of his seeing too little , she might have fancied too much .	2915.858400121455
and though feeling no reliance on her , could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved .	3254.421590806132
Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Bingley's name had been last mentioned between them ;	3964.3165274497396
CHAPTER XVI .	12871.90986889334
Did you go by the village of Kympton ?	7619.942846005225
Bennet's expectations were fully answered .	10486.391158115359
Will you come and see me ?	8358.918789470981
1 .	9967.378404281952
As she pronounced these words , Darcy changed colour ;	6336.803096806365
They all paint tables , cover skreens and net purses .	6139.210311192295
But now we may be silent .	5227.180591983348
After a short silence , the lady first spoke .	5413.567063062506
But here , by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister's absence , I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized .	3963.897690000601
Elizabeth obeyed , and running into her own room for her parasol , attended her noble guest down stairs .	4371.103136632079
For about three years I heard little of him ;	6204.201614692329
Has your governess left you ?	10079.579753717015
but I was over-ruled , as I always am .	3772.6109776548683
The family were assembled in the breakfast room , to receive them .	3988.917029158823
and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion .	4284.186575392809
Unless the elder brother is very sickly , I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds .	4544.881887030735
If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him ;	3213.1152598476506
but so we all were .	6730.753251939577
Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew , but he had never seen any thing but affability in her .	2980.8003096869566
Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had , from the distress of the moment , been led to make Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister ;	2959.496682812604
Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter , that Charlotte , really rejoicing in the match , was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over .	3747.29586626916
You are to understand , Miss Bennet , that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose ;	2844.9381543735103
She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs .	4987.928530172374
The farewell between herself and Wickham was perfectly friendly ;	6215.86623831398
I wonder , said he , at the next opportunity of speaking , whether he is likely to be in this country much longer .	2448.5662383325084
She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance , Hurst and Miss Bingley .	2397.63301130204
And , if I may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your lady possesses .	4009.3662232275196
it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours , which the discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable ;	3889.8720327667447
Let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers .	5703.89145025918
In comparing her recollection of Pemberley , with the minute description which Wickham could give , and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor , she was delighting both him and herself .	3142.3902611670965
He was growing quite inattentive to other people , and wholly engrossed by her .	3242.998622421518
I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Darcy .	3844.253736595623
She had better have stayed at home , cried Elizabeth ;	3173.8692594499007
On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn , your uncle had a most unexpected visitor .	4055.483768545677
and , turning to Elizabeth , said , Miss Eliza Bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room .	2501.5496275436944
It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both ;	3216.0132796326684
Yes ;	10872.67006892519
The favour of your company has been much felt , I assure you .	3344.1471110548596
We have heard nothing from town .	5849.621080383807
Really , Collins , cried Elizabeth with some warmth , you puzzle me exceedingly .	5337.044441790521
They are gone down to Newcastle , a place quite northward , it seems , and there they are to stay , I do not know how long .	2804.41419737136
Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather , which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Wickham ;	4678.038737573911
and , in short , as the time drew near , she would have been very sorry for any delay .	2284.9754762830485
But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation , she made no answer .	3271.2083368363215
Perhaps we might be deceived .	10611.929290532398
the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father ;	4845.731745466837
Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there , that day ;	4606.978362567791
E9 .	26746.76715370772
One seems so forlorn without them .	6995.464852043643
I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever .	2869.2929808575163
You need not send them word at Longbourn of my going , if you do not like it , for it will make the surprise the greater , when I write to them , and sign my name Lydia Wickham .	2739.0404651376093
but he never distinguished her by any particular attention , and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourites .	3258.8542681062286
Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure , and she was eagerly calling out , while her daughter read , Well , Jane , who is it from ?	3495.022294418141
I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more .	2827.8283660487027
His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling .	7748.62745044253
but now as the first shock is over , shall I own that I long for your return ?	4565.390833409799
My faults , according to this calculation , are heavy indeed !	5343.406137632329
You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for resisting every repetition of it .	3178.200330623003
She practises very constantly .	8771.062870465337
She had very little notice from any but him .	3595.0442623409162
In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley , whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose .	3512.7264417217852
but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at Hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of and Collins's happiness ;	2988.7915275853575
Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all ;	6752.3918663853465
Upon the whole , I am much pleased with him .	3041.7061997885253
Collins , you must send a servant with them .	3575.421189741563
It is a grievous affair to my poor girls , you must confess .	3387.2132303803487
and when the carriage drove up to the door , the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces , and displayed itself over their whole bodies , in a variety of capers and frisks , was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome .	3198.1707515196817
It was impossible to imagine ;	4700.779659574362
That is very true , replied Elizabeth , and I could easily forgive his pride , if he had not mortified mine .	2253.513612990526
The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial , and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded , as having passed at the Netherfield ball , and as confirming all his first disapprobation , could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers .	3134.4075063734904
If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room , I shall be very thankful ;	2829.4968282493046
But in all , and in almost every line of each , there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style , and which , proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself , and kindly disposed towards every one , had been scarcely ever clouded .	2906.591506238948
I saw them the night before last .	5324.955603467126
With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes , did Lydia , assisted by Kitty's hints and additions , endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn .	3851.8314285161896
Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ?	5129.100650857603
I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women .	3767.9560644618737
She would be in nobody's way , you know , in that part of the house .	2551.3013643944646
Oh !	5043.244884590713
and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother , and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance , particularly grateful to the daughter .	3527.713111494309
the turning past , he was immediately before them .	4482.577571082724
They had frequently been staying with her in town .	4510.066733121852
They will take care not to outrun their income .	5301.6001071038945
These two girls had been above an hour in the place , happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner , watching the sentinel on guard , and dressing a sallad and cucumber .	4286.788196717234
How you must have hated me after that evening ?	6145.318573910313
She is all affability and condescension , and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over .	2975.6974829151072
If she heard me , it was by good luck , for I am sure she did not listen .	2800.829055178193
He smiled , looked handsome , and said many pretty things .	4384.869446563539
The very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour , and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of .	3554.518550182567
By this time she is actually with them !	7056.850776828928
Not these two or three years perhaps .	7062.775422261512
and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable .	3557.259834331797
It amazes me , I confess ;	6277.085726767935
Miss Bennet , do you know who I am ?	4525.367985606075
As they walked home , Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen ;	3915.130731786424
Its business office is located at 8<DATE> West , Salt Lake City , UT 84116 , ( 801 ) 596-1887 .	5362.281203981799
and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably , when the sound of horses drew their notice , and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street .	3071.0299380384504
Supposing him to be attached to me , would my refusing to accept his hand , make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ?	4414.7959258364135
That had his actions been what Wickham represented them , so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world ;	4008.187945424005
Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent ;	5183.899098963643
Dining out , said Bennet , that is very unlucky .	4749.562350634335
Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a depravity , to which the separation of two young persons , whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison .	3279.3818609608347
Charlotte tried to console her .	7640.472942424228
one meets it every where .	12298.390220112427
they are even impartial towards Miss King .	8310.36692913093
You shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very dreadful .	5273.946034516492
It may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement .	3333.8939216787116
After lamenting it however at some length , she had the consolation of thinking that Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn , and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that , though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses .	2970.7233534631714
For my part , I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody .	3777.5997928869147
Mary , however , continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them .	3660.0763246939327
I am always glad to get a young person well placed out .	3376.158856623638
She shook her head .	5577.687246889702
The park was very large , and contained great variety of ground .	5405.324453900924
what could she mean by it ?	7719.287705631257
Darcy may hug himself .	7429.650846313117
The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her .	4045.092678281196
and I am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not .	1767.3789879165156
It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing , said Bingley .	3639.9922751167524
Most willingly .	23113.64370500188
But do not imagine that he is always here so often .	4252.855256451954
If you were sensible of your own good , you would not wish to quit the sphere , in which you have been brought up .	2837.99221369829
When I consider , she added , in a yet more agitated voice , that I might have prevented it !	2821.2844776507577
The little Gardiners , attracted by the sight of a chaise , were standing on the steps of the house , as they entered the paddock ;	3187.865294714737
It keeps him in good humour , said she , and I am more obliged to you than I can express .	2581.249776845029
Say that urgent business calls us home immediately .	8722.690438202339
every body says that he is ate up with pride , and I dare say he had heard somehow that Long does not keep a carriage , and had come to the ball in a hack chaise .	3146.507799067475
But they did pass away , and and Gardiner , with their four children , did at length appear at Longbourn .	3624.4633275891747
He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention .	4641.388960999514
Let me mend it for you .	5095.39053406803
Her heart had been but slightly touched , and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice , had fortune permitted it .	2810.985756243079
I do think Long is as good a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls , and not at all handsome : I like them prodigiously .	3356.47766115865
On his quitting the room , she sat down , unable to support herself , and looking so miserably ill , that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her , or to refrain from saying , in a tone of gentleness and commiseration , Let me call your maid .	2765.19167711306
1813 .	40535.86118978839
Upon this signal , the youngest of her daughters put herself forward .	5791.53809014597
Bennet had many grievances to relate , and much to complain of .	4706.396846537215
You take delight in vexing me .	5279.139394472606
For my part , Bingley , I always keep servants that can do their own work ;	4501.870612818663
Darcy , you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner .	3615.7180085872214
He owed a good deal in the town , but his debts of honour were still more formidable .	4193.90031709115
Darcy's shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict , gave her a keener sense of her sister's sufferings .	4070.0615434965043
They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her , and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her , So , Miss Eliza , I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham !	3049.3741839857894
yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week .	6096.248040067123
I must have employment and society .	4816.574592504384
It would be nothing ;	5840.502128164298
and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room .	3175.386203542873
I should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me .	3012.3638132563265
No , no , you shall not deceive me .	3671.01409719215
that to be in the same room , the same party with him for so many hours together , might be more than I could bear , and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself .	3146.9948178722
And then , said she , if that very improbable event should ever take place , I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself .	2809.287092893913
Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment ;	7728.204596750521
After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour , without hearing Miss Bingley's voice , Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family .	3117.623700943326
it had been written five days ago .	5732.080151916876
I do not know the particulars , but I know very well that Darcy is not in the least to blame , that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned , and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way .	2071.540700847254
Yes , very handsome .	6464.1243182017915
my uncle !	18429.93698900018
But in such cases as these , a good memory is unpardonable .	4605.859924854287
Darcy !	12692.46521465058
Collins made his declaration in form .	8101.037871287491
Lady Catherine rose also , and they turned back .	4634.885519050576
My good opinion once lost is lost for ever .	4492.220015527777
Send back your answer as soon as you can , and be careful to write explicitly .	4719.094689442313
The feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation .	3945.663097337255
They found Mary , as usual , deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature ;	4908.158578429582
CHAPTER XXI .	15764.050975065456
Their table was superlatively stupid .	10159.245840086676
Jane now came up .	9780.124086266029
She then took a large house in Edward-street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings .	4207.185292428083
CHAPTER XIX .	11147.934488852214
and now , my dear Jane , what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business ?	3118.437859961217
And what arts did he use to separate them ?	5380.466518747274
Mary and Kitty have been very kind , and would have shared in every fatigue , I am sure , but I did not think it right for either of them .	2112.130601943993
cried Elizabeth , with the greatest satisfaction .	4010.4115547191777
Again his astonishment was obvious ;	13016.617015356733
Why did not you all learn ?	8765.054677949298
Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy , though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Bingley's regard , and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it .	3032.5629271989956
He was then , he said , on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her .	2923.6079907536755
It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single .	5104.458608613403
At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies , by not asking them to dance , and I spoke to him twice myself , without receiving an answer .	3410.5899468136517
Your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man I know ;	4900.504308960017
As it was certain , however , that somebody was coming , Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion , and walk away with him into the shrubbery .	3416.223904528257
There can be no doubt of that .	4927.068317383105
and besides all this , she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking , the tone of her voice , her address and expressions , or the word will be but half deserved .	3305.404394198158
Good bye .	16816.044324972187
Bingley arrived .	16645.661763261687
Yes that is what makes it amusing .	7479.986635638485
yes ;	27674.411834426664
I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me ;	3564.1604504738602
and from her correspondence with her sister , there was still less to be learnt for her letters to Kitty , though rather longer , were much too full of lines under the words to be made public .	3190.572235965894
but the latter half , which was dated a day later , and written in evident agitation , gave more important intelligence .	3837.7695680361735
He knows where we live .	7810.88620562028
and , among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army .	3557.7095268141647
In truth I must acknowledge that , with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage , I should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion , while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings .	3269.7875003952317
You do not blame me , however , for refusing him ?	3359.5303343860733
for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion , I should at present detest his very name , and wish him all manner of evil .	4062.0155229937827
and from the observation of the day altogether , she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented .	3386.786759904859
I do not wish to avoid the walk .	2908.57191187408
What pin-money , what jewels , what carriages you will have !	5838.078102724485
Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl , and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose .	3648.8890636530105
She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Forster , and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton , where the temptations must be greater than at home .	2968.7427488196954
but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others , and she had no opportunity of detaining them .	2476.6357346398263
All Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away ;	6334.522214126153
I described , and enforced them earnestly .	6507.0399195100745
for , of course , they were to have a son .	3668.622628601103
But is it certain , absolutely certain ?	6793.28916468976
Mr .	40535.86118978839
CHAPTER XVII .	11147.934488852214
She was not equal , however , to much conversation , and when Miss Bingley left them together , could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with .	2947.777932816775
so I will dictate , and you write for me .	4904.91431121211
The surprise of such an application was great indeed ;	5004.398516398543
but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much .	3114.95152331086
He has been accused of many faults at different times ;	4751.633113354894
Have you had any flirting ?	10029.24096902634
and luckily for the others , the business of love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company .	3418.207823077858
What shall we do with him ?	6990.383068026112
First , that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion ;	4967.455594986658
and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , I hope , acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Wickham .	2457.2652990684865
For your sake , turning to Charlotte , I am glad of it ;	3218.9594765197376
Design !	40535.86118978839
She is a very good kind of girl , I believe .	2535.5965520338327
Every savage can dance .	10423.400329634464
At length , every idea seemed to fail him ;	4577.85097297165
Oh !	5043.244884590713
END OF VOL .	14469.460384122882
F5 .	40535.86118978839
I have heard , indeed , that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two .	2572.786199542725
I will only say farther , that from what passed that evening , my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me before , to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection .	3388.2643965530538
Catherine , weak-spirited , irritable , and completely under Lydia's guidance , had been always affronted by their advice ;	5397.608097251688
The moral will be perfectly fair .	6906.724232675022
and she lay awake two whole hours , endeavouring to make them out .	3417.056723618242
F3 , this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' , WITH NO OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND , EXPRESS OR IMPLIED , INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE .	4577.453170486959
Let me advise you then , my dear Sir , to console yourself as much as possible , to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever , and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence .	3064.5821815188297
how would she have behaved ?	10574.274875214069
There , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard .	2455.125529371009
She could think of nothing but of Wickham , and of what he had told her , all the way home ;	2381.7629095288876
There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley , that could provoke his ridicule , or disgust him into silence ;	4089.0650292587125
and the possibility of her deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret .	3949.3144872815988
Her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely recollected her interest in the affair , and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth , seemed to have fixed them on her more , and more cheerfully .	3186.250219693211
It does not necessarily follow that a deep , intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours .	4274.427945680248
His sense of her inferiority of its being a degradation of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination , were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding , but was very unlikely to recommend his suit .	3733.9663777240794
and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged , as by no means unpleasing , though it could not be exactly defined .	2951.107198136153
or at least , by the predominance of virtue , atone for those casual errors , under which she would endeavour to class , what Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance .	3941.6680840645095
Colonel Fitzwilliam , who led the way , was about thirty , not handsome , but in person and address most truly the gentleman .	4202.610570984679
and till the morrow , their going was deferred .	5205.702330159717
Anxious and uneasy , the period which passed in the drawing-room , before the gentlemen came , was wearisome and dull to a degree , that almost made her uncivil .	4596.570184886285
I have nothing to say against him ;	2810.349974159511
She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged .	4625.83639197141
Gardiner was surprised and concerned ;	9407.38931321901
They are my old friends .	6184.111469067348
And that I suppose is one of your sisters .	4206.965422981082
My mother means well ;	7450.473183349567
I shall like it of all things .	4430.282716747257
I do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to .	3123.0778326447
Have a little compassion on my nerves .	8226.031734456463
And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman , Ma'am ?	4741.410827512054
It was not all settled before Monday : as soon as it was , the express was sent off to Longbourn .	2698.0976300762586
Their manners are not equal to his .	7089.9095545439195
His behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire .	3741.787717360287
CHAPTER IV .	11147.934488852214
It is done , however , and it was done for the best .	2482.057962154965
and all that I can hope in this case is , that she is deceived herself .	2659.4962985714305
and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate .	4007.286447190568
and with a more smiling solemnity replied , It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably .	3548.7952186482744
But Jane could think with certainty on only one point , that Bingley , if he had been imposed on , would have much to suffer when the affair became public .	3022.681728149157
She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind .	4115.49862050477
It is a nice long walk , and Darcy has never seen the view .	3409.0179308493284
our authority was too good .	10829.243919802348
Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the good will of Hurst and Miss Bingley ;	3977.634291280693
He has many friends , and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing .	3568.7556519394866
She talked on , therefore , without interruption from any of them till they were joined by Collins , who entered with an air more stately than usual , and on perceiving whom , she said to the girls , Now , I do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your tongues , and let Collins and me have a little conversation together .	2672.1724506971427
that was impossible ;	11523.592767392243
It cannot be concealed from any one .	4611.035202343919
Denny addressed them directly , and entreated permission to introduce his friend , Wickham , who had returned with him the day before from town , and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps .	3386.072192272804
but perhaps you would like to read it .	4318.986836702805
Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance .	8341.260313843351
Oh !	5043.244884590713
said Jane faintly smiling , You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , I could not hesitate .	3769.90725236474
They were soon gone again , rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise , and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Bennet's civilities .	4004.6310066972437
She held out her hand ;	6620.301663839463
the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door , and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual .	3738.567698241916
Bennet protested against any description of finery .	7867.275080221129
and pride has often been his best friend .	4821.844273541768
Elizabeth related to Jane the next day , what had passed between Wickham and herself .	2885.6889183754383
When the tea-things were removed , and the card tables placed , the ladies all rose , and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him , when all her views were overthrown , by seeing him fall a victim to her mother's rapacity for whist players , and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party .	2693.0265597583157
They were to be off as soon as possible .	2906.678942045205
I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life .	3183.7159061019993
Others of the party were now applied to .	7899.065933850545
I will leave him to himself .	3950.6972518763146
How good it was in you , my dear Bennet !	4258.634779498678
in half a minute the letter was unfolded again , and collecting herself as well as she could , she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham , and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence .	3138.295784967805
When the engagement was for home , some of the officers always made part of it , of which officers Wickham was sure to be one ;	3340.040260242741
till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante .	4971.163696573298
E6 .	40535.86118978839
Bennet invited him to dine with them ;	5503.821022582815
You need not distress yourself .	6205.160693100896
and he was more communicative , and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him .	3120.858747237561
What do you mean , Bennet , by talking in this way ?	4038.4337156525853
A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features , but he said not a word , and Elizabeth , though blaming herself for her own weakness , could not go on .	2974.2604897171013
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement , the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law .	3722.610493764722
In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name ;	6280.325536454516
Elizabeth took up some needlework , and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion .	3886.0491176059218
His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive ;	5107.714332307195
With great energy ;	13536.198362387706
there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day .	5702.356700532924
Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ;	4795.450996727793
She is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and I have no opinion of her .	2111.5917958171053
Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit , and threw back the praise on her sister's warm affection .	4651.651173328588
My visit was not long , as Caroline and Hurst were going out .	4910.993768364162
They will never be distressed for money .	5814.816938120574
for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial .	4318.605187310434
True .	28698.86935136358
your feelings , I know , will bestow it unwillingly , but I demand it of your justice .	4560.8404148188865
I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one ;	3898.3604477277654
My dear Jane , Collins is a conceited , pompous , narrow-minded , silly man ;	3950.853560382365
If he does not come to me , then , said she , I shall give him up for ever .	1944.2458372085455
I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his ill-treatment ;	4108.341768387495
Well , now let us be quite comfortable and snug , and talk and laugh all the way home .	3944.2602419441887
and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world .	1763.3438584695484

Sir William had been delighted with him .	4722.537854336097
and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair .	4891.700607774944
said Gardiner .	16530.04221584069
The business was therefore soon settled .	6182.224590398703
and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated , I felt no doubt of their happiness together .	2989.9343112219353
and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings .	4986.584813460126
but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention .	4519.760517580278
She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there , and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you .	3395.0624940004013
that I had been with you , you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone .	3910.6524043215973
but , with many expressions of concern , he confessed himself engaged elsewhere .	4320.460132946031
Wickham had received his commission before he left London , and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight .	3071.6075680263025
I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn .	3144.2143171458274
My objections to the marriage were not merely those , which I last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside , in my own case ;	3862.712837375087
Sure he will not leave London before he has found them .	5797.492783093756
Her aunt assured her that she was ;	4659.842714761719
How it could occur a second time therefore was very odd !	5696.167425822351
it was evident that he was very much in love with her .	2162.253300321389
I know we dine with four and twenty families .	4730.64831047731
He still loves me , and we are engaged .	4915.367611524743
and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers .	4127.1915445595605
Bingley of course returned with him to dinner ;	6288.370444741931
Its completion depended on others .	9973.558974216165
It pains me to offend you .	5447.341043483784
And if I had not a letter to write myself , I might sit by you , and admire the evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did .	3288.004367809507
though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible , I instantly resolved on setting off for this place , that I might make my sentiments known to you .	3092.2209398844147
His apparent partiality had subsided , his attentions were over , he was the admirer of some one else .	3710.933501862695
but for your sakes , we would do any thing .	4248.637235186898
This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife ;	4088.948736498242
I who knew what he was .	4654.2337281296905
All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes .	6463.884916853143
There I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it ;	4397.505668293445
That will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable ;	6243.597649363527
Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ;	7838.595677106344
He did every thing best in the world ;	3519.352943923811
Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these , what would have been her sensations ?	4221.997362219073
Bennet and Kitty walked off , and as soon as they were gone Collins began .	2835.6417560354935
Not that I have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body .	3657.9526715404672
Miss Bingley told me , said Jane , that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance .	2948.400509920922
she was dying to know what could be his meaning and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him ?	4186.400605047835
I wish I might take this for a compliment ;	4470.535839736355
My father and Maria are to come to me in March , added Charlotte , and I hope you will consent to be of the party .	2446.7557384883517
I saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it ;	3257.141285358717
We were always good friends ;	7570.2610513416985
The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature , must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance ;	4203.3854649279865
This was praise , of all others most extraordinary , most opposite to her ideas .	4801.107089680714
The Gardiners staid only one night at Longbourn , and set off the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement .	3556.7825654627763
She was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia , and , removed from the influence of Lydia's example , she became , by proper attention and management , less irritable , less ignorant , and less insipid .	3344.9345773955815
My dear father , I congratulate you .	3770.3853759314266
and turning round , he looked for a moment at Elizabeth , till catching her eye , he withdrew his own and coldly said , She is tolerable ;	3957.6879271160715
He does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from Darcy more than once , but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only .	3263.812613259958
He made her an offer in this very room , and she refused him .	3176.98851175206
Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase , and listened with all her heart ;	4501.080512957229
It was some time , however , before a smile could be extorted from Jane .	2819.4899824586983
Sometimes one officer , sometimes another had been her favourite , as their attentions raised them in her opinion .	5070.051579703497
and , therefore , abruptly changing the conversation , talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage .	3254.530417276884
My uncle and aunt and I were to go together ;	4137.123038369739

for on first hearing it , Bennet sat quite still , and unable to utter a syllable .	4877.013524592803
I never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter .	3284.551630485602

for Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law , that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion .	3122.7250566043112
] PRIDE AND PREJUDICE : A Novel .	6764.623716520654
You will not , I hope , consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family , my dear Madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter's favour , without having paid yourself and Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf .	3052.54064714374
I have been used to consider poetry as the food of love , said Darcy .	2796.944146885488
She had never heard of his having had any relations , except a father and mother , both of whom had been dead many years .	3268.8072593662487
Or in other words , you are determined to have him .	4758.423823114729
and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again , when Bingley , who as well as the other had sat down , suddenly rose , and whispering a few words to her sister , ran out of the room .	2149.179626771124
and secondly , of my room .	4466.992177467446

A little .	10420.722083314984
On the contrary , there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks .	4238.352097850824
and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly , and live in so rational a manner , as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten .	3511.5171770252755

It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected .	2871.1023518166426
and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day .	2676.2232203058543
Well , all I know is , that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him .	2500.6268698137364
And what claims has Lydia , what attractions has she beyond youth , health , and good humour , that could make him for her sake , forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well ?	3633.2220703781973
May I ask to what these questions tend ?	8751.153440325861
They walked on , without knowing in what direction .	5850.592742711475
CHAPTER VII .	11147.934488852214
It was a fortnight since Bennet had been down stairs , but on this happy day , she again took her seat at the head of her table , and in spirits oppressively high .	3119.1118549760236
She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on which there could be no difference of sentiment .	3792.3416834627265
then some time or other we shall be happy to hear you .	5107.415618156756
causes which , though still existing , and existing to an equal degree in both instances , I had myself endeavoured to forget , because they were not immediately before me .	3945.6740489786353
And can you likewise declare , that there is no foundation for it ?	3810.9709645612024
I knew it myself , as it was known to Miss Bingley , but her brother is even yet ignorant of it .	2441.219264448987
As long as she stays there , it is all very well .	4074.3068522424546
No arguments shall be wanting on my part , that can alleviate so severe a misfortune ;	4979.606557070745
No I cannot talk of books in a ball-room ;	6842.775270419004
I mention it , because it is the living which I ought to have had .	3336.711052416046
I write without any intention of paining you , or humbling myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , cannot be too soon forgotten ;	3073.19988241196
and her calling here was prodigiously civil !	5326.516539408934
She danced next with an officer , and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham , and of hearing that he was universally liked .	3065.050550040511
A thorough , determined dislike of me a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy .	4987.600929763793
Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister , who joined her with a cheerful look , which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors , than Elizabeth .	3441.7510760616015
Which do you mean ?	10738.302838509051
Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in Section 4 , Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation .	2827.0263092698187
But before she had been three minutes in her own room , her mother followed her .	3092.959836337105
And when you have given your ball , she added , I shall insist on their giving one also .	3142.8699585562485
If you received the work on a physical medium , you must return the medium with your written explanation .	3781.3533833769816
We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us , said Gardiner , but perhaps to the Lakes .	4027.4539065964204
But the case is this .	5204.826566317734
1 .	9967.378404281952
I believe her to be both in a great degree , replied Wickham ;	3474.862701549177
I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow , in comparison with myself , I should not pay him half so much deference .	2922.6038383031164
And do you really love him quite well enough ?	5408.1986644082235
He has heartily forgiven me now .	5259.069949744568
Yes , indeed , cried Bennet , offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood .	3452.792955087014
My aunt told me so herself on Saturday .	6038.218102278077
As it principally concerns yourself , you ought to know its contents .	5369.597174771816
You are not going to introduce yourself to Darcy ?	4055.4778244660993
Something very much to the purpose of course .	7284.773461333399
The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family .	3423.255615262212
She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither ;	4256.602322671088
I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place .	2950.1110608143367
but he saw only the father .	5360.206756829088
It would be dreadful !	6699.638531377624
Everything wore a happier aspect .	13615.796103452773
their minds were more vacant than their sisters' , and when nothing better offered , a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening ;	4110.073861824396
I told you so from the first , you may remember .	3931.096343195946
The gentlemen did approach ;	7781.085548415666
They had not been long together , before Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her ;	3316.2371610150044
But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was .	3769.2866032895113
and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another , might be remarked , he meant to make enquiries at Clapham .	3337.35142265335
Were it known to the rest of my family , I should not have merely my own gratitude to express .	3442.0256412635536
If it was to be secret , said Jane , say not another word on the subject .	2858.6229098802373
The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn ;	5078.617326621896
and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying there too .	3219.3618742251642
she could not but say , after a moment's deliberation , I am not .	2491.6418806828733
and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her , she dared not pronounce .	3592.7681295017333
and what is to divide them ?	5055.219350320794
The two youngest of the family , Catherine and Lydia , were particularly frequent in these attentions ;	3364.8021489300777
I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least .	3529.2522029342877
I London : Printed for T Egerton , Military Library , Whitehall .	4001.709602701016
for , what with her board and pocket allowance , and the continual presents in money , which passed to her , through her mother's hands , Lydia's expences had been very little within that sum .	3593.430631739051
Dearest Lizzy , I hardly know what I would write , but I have bad news for you , and it cannot be delayed .	3384.3141704905506
It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ;	3459.06793098735
No , not at all .	3398.0005132111564
You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking , and thinking for your approbation alone .	4470.628875387918
Come as soon as you can on the receipt of this .	4331.567313705053
he introduced us to his sister .	5504.248669473817
Aye because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield , and he could not help answering her ;	3650.942193876566
Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth : My dearest Lizzy , I FIND myself very unwell this morning , which , I suppose , is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday .	3515.1679779422525
and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome , discontented or too poor , she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences , silence their complaints , and scold them into harmony and plenty .	3870.3763121964907
but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear .	2913.831639807573
Lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how much he will give her .	3112.449205256222
Elizabeth was delighted .	6350.810433260328
The wish of procuring her regard , which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire , could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this .	3161.0361470984208
But it is always so .	4577.347712315856
I did not know before , that I had two daughters on the brink of matrimony .	2662.7066899160604
And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment .	3209.7802778722726
but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled , and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with .	3350.316698653474
But so we all do .	5547.107042721452
May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment , or are the result of previous study ?	4912.190997859846
But he is , beyond all comparison , the most agreeable man I ever saw and if he becomes really attached to me I believe it will be better that he should not .	2969.4791333843464
how shall I bear so much happiness !	8646.094744612326
She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia , with anxious parade , walk up to her mother's right hand , and hear her say to her eldest sister , Ah !	3564.314008116892
They were natural and just .	6711.723950221883
Denny and Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Philips's house , and then made their bows , in spite of Miss Lydia's pressing entreaties that they would come in , and even in spite of Philips' throwing up the parlour window , and loudly seconding the invitation .	3172.741355861214
and if she accepted any refreshment , seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family .	2798.6424269537615
He did not talk to me of his own arts , said Fitzwilliam smiling .	3966.200990333778
Pray do not talk of that odious man .	6689.092075936131
It is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half-hour's acquaintance , as to a real , strong attachment .	3564.1095961496862
F 1 .	16723.600952549554
every body had been most kind and attentive to him , there had been no formality , no stiffness , he had soon felt acquainted with all the room ;	3663.83950256075
Let me first see how he behaves , said she ;	4745.218209463305
and I should have gone so all the way , if Kitty had not been sick ;	2861.322351883793
but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time , she had the same story to repeat every day .	3047.9350759018344
Your daughter Elizabeth , it is presumed , will not long bear the name of Bennet , after her elder sister has resigned it , and the chosen partner of her fate , may be reasonably looked up to , as one of the most illustrious personages in this land .	3037.3365049261656
I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this , and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time , without being informed that she was very accomplished .	2368.3825420834423
On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared ;	4875.294078574123
72 of La Belle Assemblee 1 st July 1815 ] PRIDE PREJUDICE .	6703.583806317746
In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty , who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments , to make their appearance before .	3024.168252397156
Lakes , mountains , and rivers , shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations ;	6111.159769209204
But surely , said she , I may enter his county with impunity , and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me .	3038.2880406454915
He took the hint , and when Mary had finished her second song , said aloud , That will do extremely well , child .	3732.9094046950445
and when we got to the George , I do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too .	2714.559936202433
Do not you , Darcy ?	6025.2763378116515
The garden in which stands my humble abode , is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park , her ladyship's residence .	4241.584954722445
I shall go distracted .	5384.3576915825815
If you were aware , said Elizabeth , of the very great disadvantage to us all , which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded and imprudent manner ;	2987.840321063619
Elizabeth was disgusted , and even Miss Bennet was shocked .	4078.589609750331
You both did as much as you could , in planning the marriage .	4117.132421532716
And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate ;	3624.3685800686417
There's for you !	15081.759347945299
my dear , continued Bennet , I am quite delighted with him .	2382.301581443209
Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding ;	4683.620335399315
Elizabeth made no objection ;	7054.872996946157
did you admire me for my impertinence ?	10245.543522535765
The officers may not be so pleasant in General 's regiment .	4472.764076095312
By this time , my dearest sister , you have received my hurried letter ;	4494.04796944222
But not before they went to Brighton ?	6548.640231883517
When that business was over , he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for the indulgence of some music .	4164.52212015789
How much of good or evil must be done by him !	4812.66447326484
only in different lines .	14075.150686849938
Elizabeth , who had a letter to write , went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea ;	3363.488403241325
I think she will .	5579.326993906547
It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane , said she .	3021.807042513464
Miss Bingley offered her the carriage , and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it , when Jane testified such concern in parting with her , that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present .	2682.0326749591545
Did Darcy give you his reasons for this interference ?	7799.919521455015
her uncle and aunt stopped also , and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building , the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road , which led behind it to the stables .	3496.1448209512423
She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others ;	4476.538242584881
I cannot make him out .	4521.880956289273
Then , observed Elizabeth , you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman .	3679.5615832749577
but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me , was a strong inducement .	3507.3601460399477
She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her , but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea ;	2916.842301122293
and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society , and from our connection with Rosings , the frequent means of varying the humble home scene , I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome .	3555.053441310503
and he might imagine , from my father's behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that he would do as little , and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter .	2850.997785329876
The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage , explained to her that , by his wife at least , if not by himself , such a hope was cherished .	3621.9675911355735
It ought to be so ;	4343.050691523462
Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane .	6088.160348450131
that proud and repulsive as were his manners , she had never , in the whole course of their acquaintance , an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together , and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways , seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits .	3166.682941452257
Do you talk by rule then , while you are dancing ?	5643.30767162952
Oh , lord !	7018.246222296502
But , alas !	6180.611333945652
Your ladyship wants Darcy to marry your daughter ;	6733.7835695948015
CHAPTER IX .	11147.934488852214
but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way .	4683.968983150162
It may do very well for the others , replied Bingley ;	4245.118292336429
and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke , joined to the circumstance itself , and many of the circumstances of the preceding day , opened to them a new idea on the business .	3325.9768250813713
or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ?	5843.922835435329
Had I been in love , I could not have been more wretchedly blind .	3713.6505113950543
But still he would be her husband .	5262.609816911023
He had found the law a most unprofitable study , and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained , if I would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for , and I could not have forgotten my revered father's intentions .	2666.380102659915
I must have my share in the conversation , if you are speaking of music .	3377.717140368272
but her sister's was involved in it , as she thought he must be sensible himself .	2988.8507372971267
They shook hands with great cordiality ;	7486.227330539236
Do not charge a fee for access to , viewing , displaying , performing , copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works unless you comply with paragraph 1 .	3348.3115947053807
and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance , of his having ten thousand a year .	3290.0318418117677
There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer ;	3898.996531849338
and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him , as now , when all love must be vain .	3046.0313477550253
Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants .	3659.0019131337344
The marriage of a daughter , which had been the first object of her wishes , since Jane was sixteen , was now on the point of accomplishment , and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials , fine muslins , new carriages , and servants .	3137.816747045356
nor could she think , without a smile , of what her ladyship's indignation would have been .	3918.1739438438603
and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out .	2556.8116256507383
Every thing being settled between them , Darcy's next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in Gracechurch-street the evening before I came home .	3398.348129932564
In as short a time as Collins's long speeches would allow , every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both ;	3973.072774034934
But do not be cast down .	5452.866046284529
I was so vexed to see him stand up with her ;	3082.5797932544465
She is grown so brown and coarse !	5401.129100577631
I am very , very sorry .	3539.5462437496403
He now wished it more than ever .	5220.894259311021
and in farther justification of Darcy , she could not but allow that Bingley , when questioned by Jane , had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair ;	2646.194585100171
The time fixed for the beginning of their Northern tour was now fast approaching ;	4844.149364676825
But what , said she , after a pause , can have been his motive ?	2786.506853987708
they are married !	11986.381240899555
cried Elizabeth , I am excessively diverted .	3962.3578240284905
Could there be finer symptoms ?	11521.772208246111
The possibility of his having really endured such unkindness , was enough to interest all her tender feelings ;	3843.672517179554
he was moving that way ;	8724.276455552537
but with a moment's recollection and a returning smile , replied , that he had formerly seen him often ;	3528.659402243714
And what am I to do on the occasion ?	4744.750701085198
You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns , said Darcy in a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour .	3733.5899781269786
I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction , and nobody but a governess can give it .	3274.238252838872
Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth .	5802.506036745965
I expected you to stay two months .	5133.653723970724
Well , but now for my news : it is about dear Wickham ;	4381.357264730225
It was a journey of only twenty-four miles , and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch-street by noon .	2993.2376840612064
They have both , said she , been deceived , I dare say , in some way or other , of which we can form no idea .	2598.042662989929
Nor was her respect for him , though it made her more quiet , at all likely to make her more elegant .	4169.97351365463
she cried .	9570.023979050748
Collins moreover adds , I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad business has been so well hushed up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place , should be so generally known .	3513.3980109060144
and , as he spoke , he left the room , fatigued with the raptures of his wife .	2613.2056733139552
He cannot afford it .	5211.814745068657
and after relating the circumstances , she thus went on : I am now convinced , my dear aunt , that I have never been much in love ;	2292.8920958334634
I knew that Wickham ought not to be a clergyman .	3261.257092284134
And they are really to be married !	5595.805381328829
A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other , and out of their three months' acquaintance they had been intimate two .	3474.062674987607
Your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as I said before , they had a great deal of talk together .	2721.0180138154547
a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure and affection and intelligence , which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad .	4564.159401801705
Elizabeth went away with her head full of him .	4096.6633671542495
and she was perpetually either making some inquiry , or looking at his page .	3698.4540288303765
But the horror of what might possibly happen , almost took from me my faculties .	4569.012167764038
At any rate , she cannot grow many degrees worse , without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life .	3525.56416409306
Can you deny that you have done it ?	5277.902482957749
Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother's .	6176.93241789544
You could not have started a more happy idea , since you will not take comfort in mine .	3402.3539911431803
No more have I , said Bennet ;	5196.431564496637
Jane was by no means better .	4136.467922289145
Why , at that rate , you will have been here only six weeks .	4561.076146821856
I had not an idea of it .	2540.0010173940514
I never saw such a woman .	3588.9649949944655
Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid , who continued , though slowly , to mend ;	4062.3890101759357
In nine cases out of ten , a woman had better shew more affection than she feels .	5144.114436690499
Elizabeth would wonder , and probably would blame her ;	4974.545816663476
The present unhappy state of the family , rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary ;	4033.128941091107
Darcy took her place by her niece , and they walked on together .	3840.7790999940967
But from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed , respecting each circumstance , I shall hope to be in future secured , when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read .	3303.6564397480734
and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning .	3280.746319063884
but shortly recovering himself , advanced towards the party , and spoke to Elizabeth , if not in terms of perfect composure , at least of perfect civility .	3519.265475606559
I know it all ;	3852.479108497298
La !	26746.76715370772
I know of nobody that is coming I am sure , unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in , and I hope my dinners are good enough for her .	2284.89234219721
You must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm works .	3382.334446837673
Elizabeth could not but be pleased , could not but triumph .	2909.7884798111713
In spite of this amendment , however , she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn , desiring her mother to visit Jane , and form her own judgment of her situation .	3228.523123144667
is not this an agreeable surprise ?	10654.468422346321
He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be , and unconsciously closed his book .	3686.597157501446
But we considered it , we talked of it as impossible .	4394.862219438664
I can hardly write for laughing .	5458.304350805589
Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment , before their approach was announced by the door-bell , and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room .	3425.2991161541986
Her aunt now called her to look at a picture .	5852.718496951114
CHAPTER XI .	12871.90986889334
Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Bennet .	5038.022817092615
Come be quick , be quick !	10645.48868632316
She could neither wonder nor condemn , but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom , afforded no palliation of her distress .	3866.27354050441
Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh , said Elizabeth .	3659.9792343413783
Five daughters successively entered the world , but yet the son was to come ;	5107.701071130849
I do not know when I have been more shocked , said she .	1714.7730248443947
Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object .	5913.579903042562
I know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you ;	3631.4363136570596
Your attendance upon her , has been too much for you .	4191.044396856771
I am sick of Bingley , cried his wife .	3008.683538786805
How can you be so silly , cried her mother , as to think of such a thing , in all this dirt !	2471.198065806317
That is a failing indeed !	5911.633827548958
The Foundation makes no representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United States .	4042.3951267960674
but that Charlotte could encourage him , seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself , and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum , and she could not help crying out , Engaged to Collins !	2799.8482430752374
Had they been only ten minutes sooner , they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination , for it was plain that he was that moment arrived , that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage .	3438.5784795056843
Do not be afraid of my running into any excess , of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will .	4360.520928343031
Certainly , Sir ;	12493.621998939014
Elizabeth , feeling really anxious , was determined to go to her , though the carriage was not to be had ;	2815.788170157957
or in other words , to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more .	5036.348321796684
I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that .	3318.192417696243
Sir William only smiled .	9921.710567024948
and his son will be just like him just as affable to the poor .	4146.185702215431
She seems a very pleasant young woman , said Bingley .	3980.673619767994
but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature , as the compliment deserved .	2626.784376719691
but I am an idle fellow , and though I have not many , I have more than I ever look into .	2668.297383226551
Now I am quite happy , said she , for you will be as happy as myself .	2973.499877726776
but amongst other causes of disquiet , she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour ;	4292.139249446184
It was a large , handsome , stone building , standing well on rising ground , and backed by a ridge of high woody hills ;	3556.5555609603557
she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion , five and twenty years ago .	4225.708978439681
it was a better sized room , and had a pleasanter aspect ;	3971.4378490384124
Do not you know that Collins wants to marry Lizzy ?	5153.08967026228
You are uniformly charming !	6701.835648057296
org Section 4 .	20102.775686599747
Elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them .	3115.4307704047046
We have reason to imagine that his aunt , lady Catherine de Bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye .	3487.978194594077
For what do we live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ?	4707.837951209134
but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley .	4568.050398712586
Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display ;	5943.7147674803955
When I have a house of my own , I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library .	2956.038598514538
But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away ;	4652.46561550234
but respecting his abilities , and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself , she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook , and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which , in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children , was so highly reprehensible .	3260.167925130195
She read , with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension , and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes .	3370.366506759298
To Gardiner , Wickham had one means of affording pleasure , unconnected with his general powers .	5491.620623098335
It is not of peculiar , but of general evils , which I am now complaining .	3142.3111556754043
and I am happy to say , there will be some little money , even when all his debts are discharged , to settle on my niece , in addition to her own fortune .	2768.009512358713
This is the consequence you see , Madam , of marrying a daughter , said Elizabeth .	3101.954741882057
and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday , could have made such a Friday , Saturday , Sunday and Monday , endurable to Kitty and Lydia .	3386.4442977200288
On reaching the house , they were shewn through the hall into the saloon , whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer .	3743.050571305209
Wickham only shook his head .	8122.079048084816
where else can they be so well concealed ?	8975.661379987749
This roused a general astonishment ;	9448.624258500715
said she .	9106.608369586867
and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be as well to be silent .	3311.6802218444027
But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you , who is very pretty , and I dare say , very agreeable .	2585.1706610062397
but when questioned by him Denny denied knowing any thing of their plan , and would not give his real opinion about it .	2840.8309811805725
When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure , she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment .	4328.390751712903
He must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to live on .	2881.337498373265
and that his character was by no means so faulty , nor Wickham's so amiable , as they had been considered in Hertfordshire .	2676.448744263882
Till I have your disposition , your goodness , I never can have your happiness .	4859.948453936061
I do not like to boast of my own child , but to be sure , Jane one does not often see any body better looking .	2726.6350773748964
and when they next met , he looked at her only to criticise .	3650.1967182204553
Were it for nothing but his love of you , I must always have esteemed him ;	4272.9173779220955
his formal civility was just what it had been , and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family .	3296.757034371977
and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents .	4723.673239062997
but , alas !	6666.239838712772
This invaluable friend was a very young woman , and very lately married .	4210.592790699088
Of whom does Jane ever think ill ?	8904.597030314757
The faces of both , however , were tolerably calm ;	4073.622443344942
I am only ashamed of his asking so little .	3566.0768209618327
F3 .	33751.168826691726
Your uncle !	15631.17580029067
but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme .	5695.254020965463
I never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses .	3350.079970296265
I told my sister Philips so the other day .	3996.6345156584757
It is useless to talk of it .	2519.2224420208327
If we thought alike of Miss Bingley , replied Jane , your representation of all this , might make me quite easy .	3629.691539537802
and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give the praise where it was due .	3403.207550297436
Did not you ?	11677.740368264927
It must be an amusing study .	5407.242454862714
and after a short silence Bennet began repeating her thanks to Bingley for his kindness to Jane , with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy .	2905.139726179455
He is the kind of man , indeed , to whom I should never dare refuse any thing , which he condescended to ask .	2750.5741462205488
that abominable Darcy !	11193.57271890392
What an excellent father you have , girls , said she , when the door was shut .	3200.8135366484494
Does she live near you , sir ?	8456.153951153176
I see no occasion for that .	3898.74911727782
Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty , but she smiled too much .	3887.458162907147
She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable .	4320.01897833243
but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood , and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess .	3116.2338202926976
and when he did speak , it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety , not a pleasure to himself .	3266.0618948276037
but on the third , her repining was over , and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once , on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere .	3135.0046649546216
and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds .	3493.816909752496
Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you , and wants him to marry Miss Darcy .	2855.911712814151
and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice .	2894.5110915468954
With them he is remarkably agreeable .	7951.985130965532
I never met with anybody who delighted me so much .	3555.223500225346
CHAPTER VII .	11147.934488852214
Why must their marriage be private ?	9111.233843682692
I speak nothing but the truth .	5459.015953009165
The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart ;	4722.339837517455
If Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin , why is not he to make another choice ?	4670.282255625774
Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight , when she should enter the room .	4498.093312328133
In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society .	4759.35234126561
cried Elizabeth .	6998.027216350108
and what with the Philipses , the Lucases , and the officers , there was not a day without its engagement .	2624.290820704155
I am sorry you think so ;	3237.4594559150187
There are a few things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works even without complying with the full terms of this agreement .	3077.151299140423
On that head , therefore , I shall be uniformly silent ;	3584.1528144327312
and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust , naturally inclined my father to be of service to him , and on George Wickham , who was his god-son , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed .	3038.706997204776
You persist , then , in supposing his sisters influence him .	4127.743348326203
The surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great ;	2878.372973007857
Ten thousand a year , and very likely more !	5457.738762008172
It was first broken by Annesley , a genteel , agreeable-looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse , proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others ;	3435.8449731548667
Lady Catherine observed , after dinner , that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits , and immediately accounting for it herself , by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon , she added , But if that is the case , you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer .	2672.13438347322
His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention , the first to listen and to pity , the first to be admired ;	3561.483882373165
I cannot but wonder , however , at her having any such fears now , because , if he had at all cared about me , we must have met long , long ago .	2846.2758955167283
What will Wickham say ?	8008.627013746158
Elizabeth , though she did not credit above half of what was said , believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister's ruin still more certain ;	2968.7422756239903
And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice ?	6539.300961294435
Another time , Lizzy , said her mother , I would not dance with him , if I were you .	2279.629658038123
She had ventured only one glance at Darcy .	4208.959942774927
My dear Lizzy , they must have passed within ten miles of us .	3379.617899913547
His affection for her soon sunk into indifference ;	6394.151874785373
but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty .	2418.5247819580413
Kitty simpered and smiled , and hoped her turn was coming soon .	5623.1904832485525
and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another , and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be .	2843.7027399099825
What did Colonel Forster say ?	7729.548559796212
and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths , quite mistake the matter .	4149.3099268782535
But to expose the former faults of any person , without knowing what their present feelings were , seemed unjustifiable .	4278.56975881895
Not so much as I could wish , Sir ;	4734.135056673915
Both sisters were uncomfortable enough .	9791.078310564964
she cried .	9570.023979050748
Pray do , my dear Miss Lucas , she added in a melancholy tone , for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me , I am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves .	2939.8390548777834
With no expectation of pleasure , but with the strongest curiosity , Elizabeth opened the letter , and to her still increasing wonder , perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper , written quite through , in a very close hand .	3438.1071153508187
Ever since I have known it , I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it .	3359.5967702297216
Nobody can tell what I suffer !	10960.738659843504
Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister ;	3772.508115860749
Very much .	13857.927626675668
I do not deserve it .	2359.848404792553
Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman , and he was thinking of her with some complacency , when thus accosted by Miss Bingley , I can guess the subject of your reverie .	3190.4027791017006
He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room .	2896.340351751536
On finding Bennet , Elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words , May I hope , Madam , for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth , when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ?	2720.0143754543774
Kitty and me were to spend the day there , and Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening ;	3969.3381198041134
Darcy bowed .	15254.149617344381
but her spirits returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be duped , by the sister at least .	3713.2651484764765
Where shall you change horses ?	12297.997754828939
We all love to instruct , though we can teach only what is not worth knowing .	5043.325686910039
They attacked him in various ways ;	8025.260829026057
That he should even speak to her was amazing !	6067.008450442258
He was struggling for the appearance of composure , and would not open his lips , till he believed himself to have attained it .	2913.80601799323
She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight , and was certain of a willing listener in Jane , whenever she might wish to talk again of either .	3326.4651206128283
The tumult of her mind was now painfully great .	4861.950991484461
Oh , yes !	5724.659857146617
and the respect which he felt for her high rank , and his veneration for her as his patroness , mingling with a very good opinion of himself , of his authority as a clergyman , and his rights as a rector , made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness , self-importance and humility .	2961.954857787921
But , perhaps his sister does as well for the present , and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her .	2616.164627820157
but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to .	4236.332506141231
The first week of their return was soon gone .	5327.49927634898
It mortifies me .	6482.880486602647
Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood ;	4924.412677596498
I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more about it , and to ask when Denny comes back from town .	2864.8133731663984
but if that be the case , there can at least be no want of subject .	3751.746954248425
It must have been his sister's doing .	4466.168608697707
and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning .	2497.178272029485
Collins's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter , to whom they could give little fortune ;	4630.280063953194
but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish .	3096.7654381539305
and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship's carriage was ready to take them all home .	3343.099941844492
The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent , had made a great difference in the country , and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees .	3380.7968136567397
But you are not entitled to know mine ;	4872.956480059785
cried Elizabeth .	6998.027216350108
Jane looked at her doubtingly .	7043.303847687024
E9 .	26746.76715370772
The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished ;	5340.902570350713
Had she found Jane in any apparent danger , Bennet would have been very miserable ;	4642.771441478606
These are home questions and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature .	4510.018641605542
And if not able to please himself in the arrangement , he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice .	3735.362830125259
In the first place , replied Gardiner , there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland .	3087.1458626788926
In Three Volumes .	7986.324365441749
More thoughtfulness , and less anxiety to please than when they last met , were plainly expressed .	5985.508140824872
His former acquaintance had been numerous ;	8403.681910008074
There was no one therefore who could be pointed out , as likely to give any news of him .	3192.425506267305
' Allow me , by the way , to observe , my fair cousin , that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer .	2881.290545281368
It has been most unconsciously done , however , and I hope will be of short duration .	2770.9239621194743
and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood .	4551.0418544119575
Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings , and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them .	3792.925350422274
Other books were produced , and after some deliberation he chose Fordyce's Sermons .	6421.1170579672835
He found her as handsome as she had been last year ;	4250.871016976056
and it was certain , that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one , whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his weakest side .	3121.270547514238
Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory .	7033.635024125202
But here he was set right by Bennet , who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook , and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen .	3238.048851196396
Her character will be fixed , and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous .	3959.041832276423
Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole Park , but feared it might be beyond a walk .	4639.440008615079
and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins , the excellence of its cookery was owing .	3884.2881323602273
She was now in an irritation as violent from delight , as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation .	3067.617511741865
She was immediately told , that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence ;	3574.386537559561
Bingley and Jane , however , soon allowed the others to outstrip them .	3301.6588545723675
If you do not charge anything for copies of this eBook , complying with the rules is very easy .	3713.8405615923025
If you mean Darcy , cried her brother , he may go to bed , if he chuses , before it begins but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing ;	3120.111672572738
No , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems likely to rain ;	2878.807136488512
but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given , to remind her of her post .	3793.1653291517755
They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching ;	3540.278970633909
but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went , for neither Lydia nor Collins were once silent .	3889.8944326652427
no .	24666.23778757897
yes I understand you perfectly .	11521.772208246111
On applying to see the place , they were admitted into the hall ;	4467.946445114155
You know how I detest it , unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner .	4288.520082613217
he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it .	2915.539387592957
It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side ;	3253.2273780650003
it came from Netherfield , and the servant waited for an answer .	4029.111589605857
Four weeks passed away , and Jane saw nothing of him .	4321.074707171845
but in vain .	6727.434927491612
Darcy replied with great intrepidity , Miss Elizabeth Bennet .	5304.255938903536
The gentleman experienced some change of feeling ;	6905.185725100176
I was obliged to confess one thing , which for a time , and not unjustly , offended him .	2811.7553259443757
After many pauses and many trials of other subjects , Elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first , and saying , I am astonished at his intimacy with Bingley !	3288.103649113032
Darcy took up a book ;	7992.596118369038
When she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ;	2691.959632343218
I felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in marriage , because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right .	3362.7922775023662
To this speech Bingley made no answer ;	4721.436894847927
A young man , such as you describe Bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks , and when accident separates them , so easily forgets her , that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent .	3252.3823897326647
I hope at least he has not deceived us .	3861.6486084124504
and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit .	3950.740257343293
but that it was no worse , she had need to be thankful .	3452.935309468905
but no one was less likely than Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life .	3609.792922667088
You are very ill .	5211.737434679249
Lady Catherine's great attentions to Collins you have been a daily witness of ;	4689.564095432693
Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter , and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again .	3491.614695455704
Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Bennet and the children .	6459.228288542051
Elizabeth was again deep in thought , and after a time exclaimed , To treat in such a manner , the god-son , the friend , the favourite of his father !	3179.6428502039917
and she dwelt with energy on his many merits , as they proceeded together up the great staircase .	3702.1082231234695
About a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in London ;	4432.116795116558
They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse ;	5699.926000630902
It was reasonable , however , to hope , that they would not continue long .	2221.343777909093
I am exceedingly gratified , said Bingley , by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper .	3310.1979926632457
Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed ?	7964.370699801988
So , he enquired who she was , and got introduced , and asked her for the two next .	4807.138501529302
The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed , except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention .	3821.3195233161905
Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory ;	3914.899538690892
Not that I shall though , she added to herself , as she finished the letter ;	3260.4890627158097
a sense of very great ill usage , and most painful regrets at his being what he is .	5154.358035088713
My motive for cautioning you , is as follows .	5760.780344680744
He acknowledged the truth of it all ;	4684.12562349239
But little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there .	4527.439183310035
one I will not mention ;	10095.45386534042
A scheme of which every part promises delight , can never be successful ;	5564.169357678729
See <FILENAME> or <FILENAME> : ( <URL> ) or ( <URL> ) Images of the original pages are available through Internet Archive .	4983.949081426813
She did not fear her father's opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means , that she , his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her , was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till Darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile .	2575.5602080375825
and after laughing at her some time , allowed her at last to go saying , as she quitted the room , If any young men come for Mary or Kitty , send them in , for I am quite at leisure .	3118.4627249709306
and fearful , on the contrary , as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long , she urged Jane to borrow Bingley's carriage immediately , and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned , and the request made .	2961.7323972694394
She looked at Jane , and smiled , and shook her head by turns .	3432.4315878554107
Yes , and her petticoat ;	5034.739487603772
I would go and see her , if I could have the carriage .	3085.1887707191286
How was that possible ?	10043.839364040936
It was over at last however .	4858.941517731001
avoiding Bennet as much as possible , saying not much to Elizabeth , and nothing at all to the others .	3189.101893121324
here comes Hill .	18971.43283112221
This was invitation enough .	6847.653517873936
' She did indeed .	11195.96575724683
Lady Catherine listened to half a song , and then talked , as before , to her other nephew ;	3783.1042116388076
But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought , and think only of what will make me happy , your affection , and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt .	2734.95388041285
Their powers of conversation were considerable .	9128.15783849791
Miss Bingley , said he , has given me credit for more than can be .	2766.26595312208
We know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode .	5746.715935593309
At such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth , though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband .	2799.825187655037
To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love ;	4904.51414371672
for who would object to such a partner ?	6711.742848742147
He placed himself by her .	4526.79339609577
You know my mother's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends .	3538.5273264698953
Excuse my interference .	17904.12692570067
That she should receive an offer of marriage from Darcy !	4579.417508740175
But Elizabeth had now recollected herself , and making a strong effort for it , was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished her all imaginable happiness .	2660.386900129191
The hall , the dining-room , and all its furniture were examined and praised ;	4590.180628639203
I will sit in my library , in my night cap and powdering gown , and give as much trouble as I can , or , perhaps , I may defer it , till Kitty runs away .	3246.2707324918965
But it ended in nothing , and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again .	2569.588193431867
Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over , and , though determined not to slacken as a correspondent , it was for the sake of what had been , rather than what was .	2579.8942560462683
There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same , but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh , I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters .	2917.0605460127827
She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest , but Jane with all possible mildness declined interfering ;	4682.368242782978
She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte's observation , and hurried her away to her room .	3462.700402981751
But you forget , mama , said Elizabeth , that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that Long has promised to introduce him .	2487.559636929204
Wickham indeed had gone to her , on their first arrival in London , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her .	2763.7542199550626
Have you never happened to see her there ?	6461.860166722175
Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane , while she was ill at Netherfield ?	5000.936981207133
Oh !	5043.244884590713
Conjectures as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her brain ;	4723.373563324366
She answered with equal indifference and brevity , and the other said no more .	3105.866782745836
I dislike it very much , he replied ;	4775.49795705589
For herself she was humbled ;	10628.65781293365
It certainly is a most iniquitous affair , said Bennet , and nothing can clear Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn .	3128.140438679741
Why any fear of detection ?	10139.128207023155
Bennet all amazement , though flattered by having a guest of such high importance , received her with the utmost politeness .	4336.801458462561
cried he , with an air of awkward gallantry ;	4286.377841474333
cried Lydia .	11249.79761341604
About a month ago I received this letter , and about a fortnight ago I answered it , for I thought it a case of some delicacy , and requiring early attention .	3736.828238948079
They were within twenty yards of each other , and so abrupt was his appearance , that it was impossible to avoid his sight .	2571.612915732168
When this information was given , and they had all taken their seats , Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire , and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment , that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings ;	3079.628091126601
To Catherine and Lydia , neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting .	4642.569520816591
He listened to her with perfect indifference , while she chose to entertain herself in this manner , and as his composure convinced her that all was safe , her wit flowed long .	3328.685731816335
It is something to think of , and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions .	3510.6264574557617
This son was to join in cutting off the entail , as soon as he should be of age , and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for .	3007.781525987599
there is nothing marked in its lines .	7852.250939709243
and in her air altogether , there is a self-sufficiency without fashion , which is intolerable .	3482.268756852926
I do not pretend to regret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire , except your society , my dearest friend ;	2823.6985525221694
Her astonishment , as she reflected on what had passed , was increased by every review of it .	2739.8480856873875
she times them ill .	9779.772996784139
Darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as Gracechurch Street , but he would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities , were he once to enter it ;	3497.6056773565747
CHAPTER XVII .	11147.934488852214
Not yet , replied Jane .	6415.716054446581
but I do not know when that will be .	2599.3899263336066
The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucas's last week ;	5070.547317420487
She expressed her gratitude again , but it was too painful a subject to each , to be dwelt on farther .	3460.6596689609805
Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical .	6756.48298940515
Here , leading the way through every walk and cross walk , and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for , every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind .	4277.266404250995
Elizabeth could hardly help smiling , as she assured her that had not been the case .	3086.867425637765
though , when the letters were read , Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen .	4124.3624378942695
and you , yourself , when last at Longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man , who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him .	2619.3686226651803
and Collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment ;	3242.5568198097667
Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount , and Elizabeth silently consented .	4379.18375088757
And what sort of young lady is she ?	4950.594464192513
She was engaged one day as she walked , in re-perusing Jane's last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by Darcy , she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her .	2796.3811665383387
It would have spared her , she thought , one sleepless night out of two .	3461.925389269193
who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself .	3085.40452373209
to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think , than such as did not .	4564.008543083809
But your arts and allurements may , in a moment of infatuation , have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family .	3354.101826728086
This unfortunate affair will , I fear , prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day .	4155.898120215762
It convinced her , that accident only could discover to Bingley her sister's being in town .	3780.1597892853615
He had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research ;	3771.623113066487
E9 .	26746.76715370772
I am afraid , Darcy , observed Miss Bingley , in a half whisper , that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes .	2413.9195718102083
On this point she was soon satisfied ;	7470.95298679684
He began to wish to know more of her , and as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others .	2954.04162412558
The compliment to herself and her sister , was not unfelt .	3665.758326051485
You must not blame my aunt .	4781.593799811933
has she any family ?	15349.611370468921
She was very wrong in singling me out as she did ;	4265.2211873225115
Yet , indeed , I am in earnest .	4626.804558617897
I am sure you must feel it so .	2435.948654652495
You are charmingly group'd , and appear to uncommon advantage .	4985.909682074064
Let us hope for better things .	7425.629405546884
Charlotte's first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness ;	6573.652642221586
give a loose to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you cannot greatly err .	4600.469658409492
it was melancholy to leave her to such society !	5542.757337695057
Bennet , accompanied by her two youngest girls , reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast .	4813.91693478986
always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body !	6455.693407402763
And in the wretched state of his own finances , there was a very powerful motive for secrecy , in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia's relations , for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him , to a very considerable amount .	3013.9738457567146
Her heart was divided between concern for her sister , and resentment against all the others .	3414.499597012239
I am sure I know none so handsome ;	2709.7099575382003
Were the whole arrangement complete , my disappointment would be certain .	6729.747065391923
its object was nothing less , than to secure her from any return of Collins's addresses , by engaging them towards herself .	4803.750193578699
Catherine was disconcerted , and made no answer ;	5890.578572507914
Elizabeth was surprised , however , that Wickham should consent to such a scheme , and , had she consulted only her own inclination , any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes .	2571.017212778171
But she is too much like her brother , very , very proud .	4119.091864642791
His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party ;	5075.2026842175055
Not yet , however , in spite of her disappointment in her husband , did Bennet give up the point .	2904.7441237651833
Colonel Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity , proved that he was generally different , which her own knowledge of him could not have told her ;	3699.086701981191
CHAPTER XVI .	12871.90986889334
We are not on friendly terms , and it always gives me pain to meet him , but I have no reason for avoiding him but what I might proclaim to all the world ;	2883.2316392811085
I have not seen her for many years , but I very well remember that I never liked her , and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent .	2492.3186510324695
I am perfectly serious in my refusal .	4052.814342932775
You may well be surprised , Miss Bennet , at such an assertion , after seeing , as you probably might , the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday .	3235.3459075919977
But it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations , and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for her , for a woman who had already refused him , as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham .	2927.802102243429
no wonder if they love her better .	7601.34016443185
He could be still amiable , still pleasing , to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town ;	3103.757268918645
It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long expectations .	3136.9695317901856
I perfectly comprehend your feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been .	4013.0238325080063
The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits , in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share .	3815.0473130685036
From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach , and with many speeches of thankfulness on Collins's side , and as many bows on Sir William's , they departed .	3737.2077606123084
The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world , though only a few weeks before , when Lydia had first run away , they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune .	3054.0405944621075
The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse , or covering a skreen .	4536.694224824495
Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia ;	6820.812879238188
As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night ;	3525.8174485529075
Elizabeth , however , had never been blind to the impropriety of her father's behaviour as a husband .	2990.0565609437326
The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic .	4753.958611008242
Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton .	5420.624258830821
and in their brother's manners there was something better than politeness ;	4283.974443608736
Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight .	6773.616989020417
Yes the late Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift .	5110.605942726801
Lady Lucas herself has often said so , and envied me Jane's beauty .	5584.617430925821
We will go round the Park every day .	4901.507438870992
What would she have said ?	8490.026061959292
Of Collins and Lizzy .	10235.229633606314
and his civilities were worn out like his information .	5001.212854732185
Three daughters married !	17637.384347759555
but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just ;	4017.580577332695
One does not know what to think .	4977.74878692416
She resolved to give her the information herself , and therefore charged Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner , to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family .	2755.915356621222
I have heard much of your master's fine person , said Gardiner , looking at the picture ;	3284.845255446696
They may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more exceptionable purpose .	4810.41652859301
Elizabeth could not refuse , though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit .	3522.800430657737
But every body is to judge for themselves , and the Lucases are very good sort of girls , I assure you .	2674.5316605215794
And as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses , to buy them , after they are married .	3711.5515648196824
I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular , but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish .	3529.9346159850493
She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her , must be the work of her brother , and without looking farther , it was satisfactory ;	3083.2673693792535
advised her to return to bed , and promised her some draughts .	6453.593527787173
His regiment is there ;	9102.625527693639
END OF THE SECOND VOLUME .	11158.772736958248
Stay , stay , I will go myself .	6588.823706915495
did not I mention it to you ?	7940.471082954669
Elizabeth privately added , And how much I shall have to conceal .	4651.110373508414
And with these words he hastily left the room , and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house .	3150.106681734827
This match , to which you have the presumption to aspire , can never take place .	4370.556464945554
Exceedingly well .	17684.01734426182
But he paid her not the smallest attention , till her grandfather's death made her mistress of this fortune .	3936.2092273771027
and yet there have been things enough happened in the time .	4247.128878452979
Without allowing herself time for consideration , and scarcely knowing what she felt , Elizabeth on finishing this letter , instantly seized the other , and opening it with the utmost impatience , read as follows : it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first .	3303.4113450360087
The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire , lest she should suffer from the change of room ;	3990.096612944296
I am glad it occurred to me to mention it ;	2644.534737697603
but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us , for she went up stairs half an hour ago .	2778.3354198965553
CHAPTER XIII .	11147.934488852214
An easy distance do you call it ?	7062.868854006886
Lizzy , cried her mother , remember where you are , and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home .	3302.2458222603454
and , to imitate his politeness , she began , as they met , to admire the beauty of the place ;	3181.748214362094
Then taking the disengaged arm of Darcy , she left Elizabeth to walk by herself .	4420.709685643335
But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general .	3425.7786086583055
Nothing child , nothing .	10560.555726448001
It was possible , however , that some of his companions in the shire , might be able to give more information ;	2543.587816832838
Well , cried Elizabeth , have it as you choose .	4338.573068708084
but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him , her anger was turned against herself ;	4047.6541444146787
Had it been your uncle's doing , I must and would have paid him ;	4707.461933164247
She assured him that no one intended to play , and the silence of the whole party on the subject , seemed to justify her .	2493.6586818748037
She was shewn into the breakfast-parlour , where all but Jane were assembled , and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise .	3258.884739790273
and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away .	3493.2998932862097
The observations of her uncle and aunt now began ;	4198.3007945482605
Elizabeth made no answer ;	4053.41924826646
I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home , and see if I can make it up any better .	2926.1803313067494
He must be an oddity , I think , said she .	3221.1526853776254
How can you talk so ?	6192.584020309003
Has she been presented ?	14076.161070601409
There were some very strong objections against the lady , were Colonel Fitzwilliam's words , and these strong objections probably were , her having one uncle who was a country attorney , and another who was in business in London .	3675.3483839388878
I shall see her again !	4020.314314502456
But her mind was so busily engaged , that she did not always know when she was silent .	3040.553275365704
though often standing within a very short distance of her , quite disengaged , he never came near enough to speak .	4431.605678014271
Yes , there was something in that ;	4718.258958445477
After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ;	3924.057530404391
Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention .	5840.949748209482
It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match .	3286.6353328225937
Beyond a doubt , they do wish him to chuse Miss Darcy , replied Jane ;	4738.8170259536955
But of course she did not mention my name to you .	3280.941411200761
But as no such delicacy restrained her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back , she should think herself very ill used .	2953.712179061325
Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts ;	4606.394157501554
If he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to Long .	3455.5636820371265
' Those were your words .	11108.273617797971
It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life .	4420.161252081741
Her nose wants character ;	10260.368820993162
but depend upon it I will carry my point .	4685.9273629610325
Gratitude , not merely for having once loved her , but for loving her still well enough , to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him , and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection .	3878.522690180828
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again , having still a great deal to say to her , and many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends .	3045.9275892904257
Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves .	7215.676748078834
and in your heart , you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you .	3627.1015857173206
Oh !	5043.244884590713
Yes , and I had heard it before .	3155.7201769081285
As he said this , she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer .	3044.7323624292912
Her colour changed , and she said no more .	3887.45214507622
Such formidable accounts of her Ladyship , and her manner of living , quite frightened Maria Lucas , who had been little used to company , and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings , with as much apprehension , as her father had done to his presentation at James's .	2809.6093260947837
When they had gained their own room , Jane taking out the letter , said , This is from Caroline Bingley ;	3669.986916294971
Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest , and then , sick of this folly , took refuge in her own room , that she might think with freedom .	3083.702510160211
The rector of a parish has much to do .	4718.13366818567
You forced me into visiting him last year , and promised if I went to see him , he should marry one of my daughters .	3514.6014306597353
She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors , she wanted to compose her own , and to make herself agreeable to all ;	3344.389018029337
Pardon me for interrupting you , Madam , cried Collins ;	5953.607639018207
;	74878.58955333316
Society has claims on us all ;	9159.841792340738
They were rather handsome , had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town , had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds , were in the habit of spending more than they ought , and of associating with people of rank ;	2791.5109578687193
and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn .	4247.144938966986
After this day , Jane said no more of her indifference .	5204.842160242147
and now we are better .	4855.37338409006
Your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you .	4225.005077210052
There is some sense in what he says about the girls however ;	4958.384758042503
and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself .	3256.7912935761956
Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me .	4790.866311881498
Lady Catherine herself says that in point of true beauty , Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex ;	4026.52178551373
thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together ;	6642.407010195817
Had I but explained some part of it only some part of what I learnt , to my own family !	3834.4477049914226
Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue ;	5526.581482528675
I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love !	4755.615394320731
when we met at Pemberley .	8387.764472993722
My temper would perhaps be called resentful .	7225.608571240069
You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world .	2551.6334316837597
I did not know that you intended to walk , said Miss Bingley , in some confusion , lest they had been overheard .	2478.9211560010526
It was all over before I arrived ;	4662.479360489868
cried Elizabeth , as soon as they were by themselves .	2324.8379878786563
Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in .	6125.016882553523
wished his fair cousins health and happiness again , and promised their father another letter of thanks .	4930.842919682148
This was spoken jestingly , but it appeared to her so just a picture of Darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer ;	2762.499950255004
Miss Bingley , however , was incapable of disappointing Darcy in any thing , and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives .	3163.5713948542016
Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded ;	4442.064146669688
He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins , from a conviction that if they saw him depart , they could not fail to conjecture his design , and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise ;	2979.7579196434435
and she could not help remembering what Charlotte's opinion had always been .	2620.880915254963
CHAPTER XIV .	11147.934488852214
Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable .	6355.5037485303255
In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended ;	4538.72635349856
Well , then , you need not be under any alarm .	4275.374613795263
I think she will be pleased with the hermitage .	4213.622663753544
Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error , and seek to clear one , without involving the other .	4293.512421853655
If they believed him attached to me , they would not try to part us ;	3954.859558677035
but he eluded the skill of them all ;	4355.066924485384
Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me .	6447.581636351935
And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen .	3738.371021271832
She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman ;	3862.9929676736515
I am all astonishment .	4287.840685479926
The conversation soon turned upon fishing , and she heard Darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport .	3020.5496791837973
Dearest Jane !	21603.805852775153
The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy ;	4807.282373714928
And accordingly she did turn , and they walked towards the Parsonage together .	4217.245357801047
and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September , than any body else in the country .	2670.996938445035
I will make no promise of the kind .	3686.438526972321
But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was .	4326.806961509605
Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine , what is to befall her ?	4349.967818384409
I have been a selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle .	2967.380573207808
My dearest child , she cried , I can think of nothing else !	3803.301812137342
and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia , her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost importance , and till he entered the room , the misery of her impatience was severe .	3055.3436899848143
Some acquaintance or other , my dear , I suppose ;	3987.5300559676903
Oh !	5043.244884590713
The venison was roasted to a turn and everybody said , they never saw so fat a haunch .	4907.888625714277
Your picture may be very exact , Louisa , said Bingley ;	5195.55087667549
That he has neither integrity nor honour .	6950.1975102101305
On and Gardiner's coming up , they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment ;	3863.8787164200257
nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion .	6381.457319701993
and you cannot imagine how well he looked !	5331.045055016072
How he lived I know not .	6080.001250379343
She has two nieces of her own .	4198.1203152982225
But tell me , what did you come down to Netherfield for ?	4811.409811072407
and when I am in town it is pretty much the same .	3519.980083646279
Many small donations ( $1 to $5 , 000 ) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS .	5327.10643270571
Very well .	10415.764999866147
Oh !	5043.244884590713
It is of all subjects my delight .	4668.502039157181
I am sorry to hear that ;	3109.52951933624
and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of Lydia's leaving home .	3693.123140208021
A gentleman and a stranger !	8712.678871720294
He sat with them above an hour , and was in remarkably good spirits .	3547.72784563524
Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia ;	3936.2705606756563
what is the matter ?	10654.297978273624
The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia , depended less on any single event , or any particular person , for though they each , like Elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with Wickham , he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them , and a ball was at any rate , a ball .	2788.033963201025
Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ;	4841.658407546358
and pray tell her from me , that she cannot expect to excel , if she does not practise a great deal .	2771.959320715037
I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things .	3173.226749150891
They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room ;	5404.852874742708
nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family .	3764.7844688199757
Is my father in town ?	10815.648977078465
If I could but see you as happy !	5690.067140988301
You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling , I am sure you did .	3028.261123195694
It was not till the afternoon , when he joined them at tea , that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject ;	3059.7623391468387
Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves , vanity to what we would have others think of us .	4923.803000990135
Heaven forbid !	19587.763475129905
Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule ;	9220.099259342309
And of your infliction , cried Elizabeth with energy .	5289.491759126547
From what he said of Miss Darcy , I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , reserved , disagreeable girl .	3492.167487986828
Their other aunt also visited them frequently , and always , as she said , with the design of cheering and heartening them up , though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of Wickham's extravagance or irregularity , she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them .	3333.5785424783967
Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday ?	6970.096191371923
Without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ;	3491.2587243410994
I depend on you for that .	5348.568175184733
I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it ;	2840.403317671504
In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike , she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man's affection , and though her intentions did not vary for an instant , she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive ;	2574.376704837026
I can remember no symptom of affection on either side ;	3923.5984927996797
Your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions ;	4813.22890912968
If you should have no objection to receive me into your house , I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family , Monday , November 18th , by four o'clock , and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se'night following , which I can do without any inconvenience , as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday , provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day .	3058.281396539951
She knew not how to support herself , and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour .	3016.976987523814
for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation .	4249.744276194221
Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Miss Bennet ;	4089.8631797196604
She replied in the affirmative .	7606.882176317877
What is it you mean ?	5906.711148425717
You must feel it ;	4747.419187722335
Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play , she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer .	3332.9236493616017
You must come and make Lizzy marry Collins , for she vows she will not have him , and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her .	2439.9343172168483
replied her sister .	11690.13764643918
I might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little endeavour at civility , I am thus rejected .	3436.161079627573
I can easily believe it .	3346.015945238352
Jane , I take your place now , and you must go lower , because I am a married woman .	3584.617720793083
He took the hint , and soon began with , This seems a very comfortable house .	3936.7254932596543
and from all Bingley's connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it , from that very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him , of their becoming hereafter her own .	3235.1937439279036
Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have !	6613.972077454178
He did look at it and into it for half an hour , was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms , satisfied with what the owner said in its praise , and took it immediately .	3323.8329631059923
It adds even another motive .	7762.508680555607
My good qualities are under your protection , and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible ;	3632.535906772315
Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable .	9482.400996361535
We can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough ;	5481.750352538131
too good for the waiter , is not it ?	6696.595289227265
but it had not been so in Derbyshire .	3460.303380160045
Elizabeth , to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this , heard it in silent indignation .	3337.270671427009
What sister would think herself at liberty to do it , unless there were something very objectionable ?	4781.987492155454
but no one looked more amused than Bennet himself , while his wife seriously commended Collins for having spoken so sensibly , and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas , that he was a remarkably clever , good kind of young man .	3071.7710261484212
Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour , he had been able to get the better of himself .	3577.9649054941183
The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident .	5843.248124524113
My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology .	6387.357735657165
You may depend upon it , Madam , said Miss Bingley , with cold civility , that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us .	2618.1519539558453
They could have been understood only by her mother , who might have felt nearly the same .	3738.402151460274
I am sure I shall break mine , said Lydia .	2273.126605363745
His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary ;	5413.754743403131
What relates to yourself , is as follows .	6203.742830875378
dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter , which , in her ladyship's apprehension , peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance , in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew , which she had refused to give .	3314.256589995496
and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations .	4543.571033608828
I do not know .	2025.8840739861407
To oblige you , I would try to believe almost any thing , but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this ;	3618.3477172119065
There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them , for Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam , the younger son of his uncle , Lord and to the great surprise of all the party , when Collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him .	3196.746160295128
This is my advice .	7487.638777139418
There was also a postscript to this effect .	5191.713535820074
Though her manner varied however , her determination never did .	6264.863450254471
Good gracious !	13026.898755758692
It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day .	3654.3703675064858
Yes , I have had a letter from him by express .	3032.2192404494494
I am perfectly convinced by it that Darcy has no defect .	3686.993841098527
but when he went away , the whole family returned to their usual employments , and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration , for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden , or in reading and writing , and looking out of window in his own book room , which fronted the road .	2858.3574110532973
Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments .	7035.844849187967
Dear madam , cried Hill , in great astonishment , don't you know there is an express come for master from Gardiner ?	5358.725495172307
Gardiner added in his letter , that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day , which was Saturday .	3627.262686425983
and your wit and vivacity I think must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite .	3781.735935280061
only three miles .	17184.63809314993
Kitty , who took all these threats in a serious light , began to cry .	5512.560889962693
Two of her girls had been on the point of marriage , and after all there was nothing in it .	3175.062609157689
I am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection .	2822.031363486753
I fancy she was wanted about the mince pies .	5833.122783761884
You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy .	3310.1216007024987
for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him , I should only think worse of her understanding , than I now do of her heart .	3515.348284415396
A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music , singing , drawing , dancing , and the modern languages , to deserve the word ;	4083.5381038223804
We acted with the best intentions .	8242.735445017248
and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room .	4631.170073406067
there was good humour and kindness .	7584.373138151451
Elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him ;	4490.991332666579
Let me hear from you very soon .	5716.849335335952
and Collins , being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader , was extremely well pleased to close his large book , and go .	3732.7877441522915
How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love ?	4450.684674395416
I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me .	3759.2384934623674
my dear Bennet , as she entered the room , we have had a most delightful evening , a most excellent ball .	2866.935719990276
cried Bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , if that disagreeable Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley !	3367.00054555047
But we are none of us consistent ;	6026.187838872211
Bennet , who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him , continued her triumph .	4187.960759952651
condolence , insufferable .	20102.36327967146
With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content ;	6034.1658594687
Not at all .	5092.919759354693
Let me congratulate you , on a very important conquest .	6025.95514236714
and you must feel , as well as I do , that the woman who marries him , cannot have a proper way of thinking .	2725.5794940763685
but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply .	3315.463069244591
My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness , and I confess that I did not expect to receive more than my due .	3408.1935418218777
though when the first tumult of joy was over , she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while .	3577.6448566780628
Lizzy declares she will not have Collins , and Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy .	3598.492495952653
The journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane ;	5316.65676031438
All were struck with the stranger's air , all wondered who he could be , and Kitty and Lydia , determined if possible to find out , led the way across the street , under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop , and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot .	3447.0244913259794
Bingley was quite uncomfortable ;	9210.922009577998
He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper ;	5825.197009612234
There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law .	3846.6621086165355
But Gardiner could not be seen , and Darcy found , on further enquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning .	2901.8128351631563
The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news , and telling again what had been already written ;	4166.571220453158
No ;	16502.532430239946
I shall not go away , till you have given me the assurance I require .	3674.5890073334012
but she checked herself .	4566.00669265891
Yet why did he come ?	10530.026449780997
and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls .	3984.112653873109
On the contrary every particular relative to his sister , was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself ;	3186.2347579578036
If it be not so , let Darcy contradict it .	4308.48831388416
I guessed as much .	6107.963847874496
But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person ;	3673.0782922885614
This is a parade , cried he , which does one good ;	4779.141544370929
My dear , replied her husband , I have two small favours to request .	3360.8735656687522
cried he , turning towards her .	4985.738523215539
The walk being here less sheltered than on the other side , allowed them to see him before they met .	4182.125227932665
That among his own connections he was esteemed and valued that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling .	3375.125512505198
Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing ;	4319.537521639536
Lord !	27095.02222125315
They returned therefore in good spirits to Longbourn , the village where they lived , and of which they were the principal inhabitants .	3994.56330761957
But my father cannot .	7399.088679143205
if , indeed , such a report is in existence .	5909.0939102512175
and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in his regimentals .	4147.877923442829
The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw .	4933.079212676081
As a child , she was affectionate and pleasing , and extremely fond of me ;	3691.2523999271966
Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house , and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane .	3502.446879057848
Poor Reynolds , she was always very fond of me .	4278.620803189709
I have certainly meant well through the whole affair .	3970.9099525962197
Calling back the servant , therefore , she commissioned him , though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible , to fetch his master and mistress home , instantly .	4095.332651434956
And this is always the way with him , she added .	3339.2664706592213
I wish I could say , for the sake of her family , that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children , produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible , amiable , well-informed woman for the rest of her life ;	2342.982804902741
But my feelings are not only cordial towards him ;	4562.152357390288
It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together , and yet for the advantage of some , conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible .	2770.554170400299
After walking two or three times along that part of the lane , she was tempted , by the pleasantness of the morning , to stop at the gates and look into the park .	2927.4493259014835
Upon my honour , I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life , as I have this evening ;	3342.4975684357773
Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the next day , and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Wickham , and give him an invitation also , if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening .	2894.180931323223
Unfeeling , selfish girl !	14399.350748606781
Darcy is engaged to my daughter .	6387.538839929098
I was told , that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married , but that you , that Miss Elizabeth Bennet , would , in all likelihood , be soon afterwards united to my nephew , my own nephew , Darcy .	2890.42618488301
she cried .	9570.023979050748
They owed the restoration of Lydia , her character , every thing to him .	3705.173563239118
and she could no more bear that Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first vehemence of her disapprobation .	3389.571221047653
and could she have included Jane in the scheme , every part of it would have been perfect .	3716.1155866923186
You know not what you are about .	5068.238162968677
And upon Elizabeth's seeming really , with vexed and embarrassed looks , about to escape , she added , Lizzy , I insist upon your staying and hearing Collins .	3356.583589354415
sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man .	5262.7318607243815
Your list of the common extent of accomplishments , said Darcy , has too much truth .	4499.522965385515
E7 .	35290.54376147641
how he must have felt it !	7833.913597976245
Not at all , he replied ;	4865.66290275392
But Jane knows , as well as I do , what Wickham really is .	2957.331617236302
To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire , when that conviction had been given , was scarcely the work of a moment .	3897.284856879369
La !	26746.76715370772
Of what he has particularly accused me I am ignorant ;	6754.846549533621
And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit ;	5203.932432478752
Its banks were neither formal , nor falsely adorned .	8226.634684938324
As for Elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia , that she considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter ;	3294.8478436461564
It is unlucky , said she , after a short pause , that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country .	1904.9703685861095
Not as you represent it .	6435.465756774538
I told you the other day , of his infamous behaviour to Darcy ;	3515.4170395648152
And what is fifty miles of good road ?	5716.17187175727
till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk , she made some slight observation on the dance .	3705.7430970940986
the compliment must be all for herself .	6121.157849061584
The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected .	5146.759084925185
I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out , if possible , from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment , whether Wickham has any relations or connections , who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself .	2782.83271041703
Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay , for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other .	3277.9504220946287
You know not , you can scarcely conceive , how they have tortured me ;	4123.145729786394
A flirt too , in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation ;	5335.331801977269
and if I was her , I would not have put up with it .	2199.2377152959793
They were confined for the evening at different tables , and she had nothing to hope , but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room , as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself .	2324.329800426886
PRIDE PREJUDICE .	19976.5581898115
I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters , and beg leave to apologise for it , as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends , but of this hereafter .	3008.9674473458035
but though Jane would have defended either or both , had they appeared to be wrong , she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister .	3191.1656632354384
and affectionately taking her hand , said in reply , Do not make yourself uneasy , my love .	3211.895186920332
For heaven's sake , madam , speak lower .	6993.030172232362
when her father continued , You look conscious .	8263.741830698733
When I last saw her , she was not very promising .	3777.785987608896
They are wanted in the farm , Bennet , are not they ?	4183.876172292524
Elizabeth listened , wondered , doubted , and was impatient for more .	3865.330633431892
The part which I acted , is now to be explained .	5327.6310594471515
Elizabeth longed to observe that Bingley had been a most delightful friend ;	4364.718246383624
How merry we shall be together when we meet !	6144.239022644447
When this was done , she had a less active part to play .	4641.525310784172
Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression .	9636.93823369295
She could think only of her letter .	4162.546615235773
but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger .	3590.7166079016515
His own father did not long survive mine , and within half a year from these events , Wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally resolved against taking orders , he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be benefited .	3451.0033522669164
I do not remember her name among the ladies at court .	3611.3179379807398
and as Dawson does not object to the Barouche box , there will be very good room for one of you and indeed , if the weather should happen to be cool , I should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you large .	2716.8879489999717
but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ;	4049.8499082736453
That would be a good scheme , said Elizabeth , if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home .	2814.937666349894
though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Bingley in consequence of it , before they did .	3492.6560509468222
This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared ;	4850.383215592167
Not that I am afraid of myself , but I dread other people's remarks .	3522.725366753044
for give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained .	3691.837002864139
And so , is it quite certain he is coming ?	5176.863087920956
London : Printed for T Egerton , Military Library , Whitehall .	5861.8704179674305
Things are settled so oddly .	13615.361597213987
If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity .	3537.1174428846043
It was greatly my wish that he should do so , he added , as soon as his marriage was fixed on .	2428.146959940524
You cannot be too much on your guard .	4581.813809812337
I have said no such thing .	3375.185188633854
and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf , is natural and amiable .	3442.0653581560355
But it is not merely this affair , she continued , on which my dislike is founded .	3241.739680565377
She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind ;	3992.209627736756
and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment .	3819.6955004798833
But I make no doubt , they often talk of it between themselves .	3660.8498040110044
and before she could strike into another path , she was overtaken by Wickham .	3604.529112565299
and sometimes did venture a short sentence , when there was least danger of its being heard .	4060.7856740785764
I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ?	2538.473730396188
and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement , without the intention of marriage , she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey .	3067.46914145598
As that was the case , neither Jane , to whom I related the whole , nor I , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public ;	3431.0701451620616
After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject , Bennet coolly observed , From all that I can collect by your manner of talking , you must be two of the silliest girls in the country .	3150.0055096970805
They are in the same profession , you know ;	3602.476764294576
And I have another favour to ask .	5697.064781794729
She had not been many hours at home , before she found that the Brighton scheme , of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn , was under frequent discussion between her parents .	3101.093189847494
Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton , where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the King , during his mayoralty .	3723.917288900123
Anxiety on Jane's behalf , was another prevailing concern , and Darcy's explanation , by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion , heightened the sense of what Jane had lost .	4363.59510820437
But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends , will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ?	3572.161477848312
The other is Miss De Bourgh .	5049.689580026204
how rich and how great you will be !	6522.3869544603485
And have you heard from him often ?	6366.91499442138
In the absence of Jane , he always attached himself to Elizabeth , for the pleasure of talking of her ;	2722.461855376861
What am I to do ?	7519.086226123349
Engraved for No .	18971.43283112221
Elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint , being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply .	4001.637406012164
That they might have met without ill consequence , is perhaps probable ;	5807.416331210431
But I can guess how it was ;	4249.169043952043
But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else .	3274.2134607201756
but neither that , nor any thing else , awakened a suspicion of the truth .	4015.9968052366876
I hope there was .	4557.932825280115
1 .	9967.378404281952
But , if I were you , I would stand by the nephew .	3125.7681897455022
Darcy walked off ;	12351.982920613731
The officer was the very Denny , concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire , and he bowed as they passed .	4100.150667217717
But here , she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character , for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness , and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet .	3461.5842660244807
Had Lydia's marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms , it was not to be supposed that Darcy would connect himself with a family , where to every other objection would now be added , an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned .	3161.628046691135
No , no , let me shift for myself ;	4342.489465444972
I am impatient to see him .	2421.4200015330343
The carriage was sent to meet them at , and they were to return in it , by dinner-time .	3539.733105225496
For forty years , he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support .	5204.09287947175
but Elizabeth heard not a word , and , wholly engrossed by her own feelings , followed them in silence .	3050.6554005678095
hang Kitty !	26925.301185366065
And my mother How is she ?	6958.582396116919
From his garden , Collins would have led them round his two meadows , but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost , turned back ;	4341.164369162647
She is happy , then , said her father , drily ;	3074.8971342641107
I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing !	3316.070988383678
I wonder when you would have spoken , if I had not asked you !	2972.2712226722474
Jane looked well , and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits , amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them .	3294.648372652508
She is almost three and twenty !	5419.97306749364
I must ask whether you were surprised ?	5361.041147400083
She listened most attentively to all that passed between them , and gloried in every expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , his taste , or his good manners .	3586.787268474273
But we are all liable to error .	5452.625940931944
Elizabeth could not but look surprised .	4238.235176896577
Bingley , from this time , was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn ;	4430.319854935774
Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him .	5422.537583052078
Younger sons cannot marry where they like .	9871.54478459579
I believe him to be Lady Catherine's nephew .	4460.939382211351
This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence , and the little value he put on his own good qualities .	4034.6412868310767
and after stating her imprudence , I am happy to add , that I owed the knowledge of it to herself .	2510.2646885359104
In future , I hope we shall be always of one mind .	4095.9069702762476
I hope , my dear , said Bennet to his wife , as they were at breakfast the next morning , that you have ordered a good dinner to-day , because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party .	1909.208906895853
his friend had given him the earliest information of it .	4306.863923584979
But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration , and gave most gracious smiles , especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them .	3547.049546034498
Mary , said she , I wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun !	2914.239239614275
Steady to his purpose , he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday , and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour , he adhered most conscientiously to his book , and would not even look at her .	3115.866899071926
let us hear all the particulars , not forgetting their comparative height and size ;	6340.42413978094
My child , let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life .	3965.4351078169843
I am sure I sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night .	2675.0826687312747
Elizabeth's collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ;	5597.100347617087
but it pleased her .	4257.15843259967
It became her turn to listen .	7165.098711747977
Lady Catherine was generally speaking stating the mistakes of the three others , or relating some anecdote of herself .	3891.980442789208
At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress , and at half past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner .	4138.983646761581
and instantly embracing her , acknowledged , with the liveliest emotion , that she was the happiest creature in the world .	2352.487285758462
He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man , upon my word ;	3883.129753429783
Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year ?	4657.636909589898
but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood , I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger .	4058.5395288187196
And who knows what may happen ?	7545.844389311738
They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter , will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others , for who , as lady Catherine herself condescendingly says , will connect themselves with such a family .	3387.8700818790276
You have withheld the advantages , which you must know to have been designed for him .	2822.6992455902846
If he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , I shall soon cease to regret him at all .	2961.0356248924136
but I think I may defy even your sagacity , to discover the name of your admirer .	3748.8769552034632
He now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before ;	3120.3490102378355
and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted , which , in her anxious interpretation , denoted a recollection of Jane , not untinctured by tenderness , and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her , had he dared .	2923.485241573341
Collins's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete .	7733.31033843021
I do not know what to say to you .	1553.0058548481556

After tea , Bennet retired to the library , as was his custom , and Mary went up stairs to her instrument .	4218.075145396934
You must give me leave to judge for myself , and pay me the compliment of believing what I say .	3351.728694857826

Our poor mother is sadly grieved .	10065.534817261832
Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through Longbourn-house .	6226.386807585337
and as it had been asked without the least suspicion , she was not distressed by his repeating it .	2601.310577504419
and I could wish , Miss Bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either .	2574.35805862801
Whenever Charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ;	5637.706760969719
But , my dear , you must indeed go and see Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood .	2364.73655075294
Elizabeth was distressed .	6094.973919224884
or me either , for that matter .	7549.622773954547
Haggerston has our directions , and all will be completed in a week .	5945.508227837554
and as she was no horse-woman , walking was her only alternative .	3622.768761174433
Her coming there was the most unfortunate , the most ill-judged thing in the world !	4398.313283234283
and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with , though she could not be in such raptures as Collins expected the scene to inspire , and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house , and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis De Bourgh .	2438.2576976239257
The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady , to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable ;	3453.8967440902716
Darcy drew his chair a little towards her , and said , You cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment .	3174.2005138933127
His being such a charming young man , and so rich , and living but three miles from them , were the first points of self-gratulation ;	3787.703636186896
Let me do it without farther loss of time .	5465.530664927049
sensible that if such an idea had been suggested , his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it .	4441.49956046006
My dear aunt , how could you think of it ?	3454.599501125328
Lady Catherine , I believe , did a great deal to it when Collins first came to Hunsford .	2991.8118245793107
I began to be afraid you would never come back again .	3966.2459490536226
What could become of Bingley and Jane !	5777.4193790395875
I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me , but if the same circumstances were to happen again , I am sure I should be deceived again .	2252.5733703946116
said her mother .	7577.77929116408
good or bad ?	18972.211194219788
They were in street .	6682.516538820575
It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat , and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour .	3065.0229082844544
Darcy had been at her sister's wedding .	6112.473376746225
Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme ;	5175.186135281243
her husband looked impenetrably grave ;	11851.624277353352
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind , as was here collected in one individual .	4419.091723651309
Such as vanity and pride .	8991.259131966892
Miss Lydia is going to be married ;	5744.7545842693935
for Bennet , having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase , than she entered the breakfast-room , and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection .	3426.1652126182803
Thank Heaven !	15898.977279388886
We have certainly done our best ;	7371.168609654392
Wickham began the subject himself .	7689.466683633065
Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day , and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation , c .	2922.7239053645912
and for the first evening she was his settled choice .	4484.9459063588265
Elizabeth was excessively disappointed ;	6197.262891053049
If your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless , you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ;	4198.535867473342
The easy assurance of the young couple , indeed , was enough to provoke him .	3094.118695201987
She followed him thither ;	8337.894745510015
He meant to resign his commission immediately ;	5981.2065005817
Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared , Darcy was continually giving offence .	4952.2692955376115
that he is to take possession before Michaelmas , and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week .	3280.6467216232104
Nor did he seem much more at ease ;	7883.726354478015
Why was he to be the judge ?	7398.427648083274
But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge ?	4289.825716145944
Hurst and Bingley were at piquet , and Hurst was observing their game .	5694.75972884646
I must beg , therefore , to be importuned no farther on the subject .	2261.2505902451767
As the weather was fine , they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park .	4440.217528473245
Then shewing her purchases : Look here , I have bought this bonnet .	5190.416696001632
and so did Forster .	6692.870980212568
I never saw a more promising inclination .	4526.373429029083
Every girl in , or near Meryton , was out of her senses about him for the first two months ;	4787.0972038618465
and pray what is the result ?	5746.060096574519
Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter , and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Bingley himself , instead of a ceremonious card .	3579.8780440638952
My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents .	3902.7255407280322
Perhaps that is not possible for any one .	5943.650765228422
It was a painful , but not an improbable , conjecture .	3519.274111162379
My mother was taken ill immediately , and the whole house in such confusion !	3732.987216753985
To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered , but the state of indecision in which she remained , as to the extent of what she should communicate ;	2581.548352622725
And you are never to stir out of doors , till you can prove , that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner .	3430.302074181827
He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from that , I am inclined to hope , he might have been misunderstood before .	2744.9477184884217
and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop , or Lady Catherine de Bourgh , by venturing to dance .	2473.5694057728047
Do you think it incredible that Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ?	3331.7020139602323
but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side , I hope it will not be long before they are .	2894.389611275244
Elizabeth was pleased to find , that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend , for , though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world , she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him .	2286.284267257247
But who could have foreseen such an attention as this ?	5035.662402262921
and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin's affairs , and whose character she had no reason to question .	3301.9134154993803
Compliments always take you by surprise , and me never .	7555.540488977107
or under what misrepresentation , can you here impose upon others ?	6601.176512411277
My feelings in every respect forbid it .	4303.873722336668
The families who had been in town for the winter came back again , and summer finery and summer engagements arose .	3684.4943422130564
I could not bear to have her ten miles from me ;	3608.3684712480135
Such were the gentle murmurs of Bennet , and they gave way only to the greater distress of Bingley's continued absence .	4144.901725157741
Jane was so admired , nothing could be like it .	4412.26426541173
their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ;	6037.7912934106
You ought all to have learned .	7631.47290380724
yes , said Elizabeth drily Darcy is uncommonly kind to Bingley , and takes a prodigious deal of care of him .	3388.3068169992475
If it be so , if I have been misled by such error , to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable .	3435.892599295233
I am a gentleman's daughter ;	3708.5181904715255
But I confess they would have no charms for me .	3306.3190314789113
That is my idea of good breeding ;	5654.536502017038
but , to be sure , it would have been such a thing for me !	2252.097470505192
But I am willing to hope the best , and that his character has been misunderstood .	3155.6918204962844
But their father , though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure , was really glad to see them ;	3469.3807774821803
To be sure , Lizzy , said her aunt , he is not so handsome as Wickham ;	2599.816918189063
Wickham so very bad !	12041.216128958979
She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire , and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister , in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter .	3156.9853483688953
Every thing was too recent for gaiety , but the evening passed tranquilly away ;	4869.208411545267
and yet , it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham .	2575.985626855598
Most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote .	5730.227802426014
He was on one side of her mother .	3308.18582311191
He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given me .	3242.6969301256863
Collins must excuse me .	7454.93365081393
I wish you very happy and very rich , and by refusing your hand , do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise .	3248.031550585256
but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing .	5139.207175482137
Bennet made no answer .	4868.087141311547
The hill , crowned with wood , from which they had descended , receiving increased abruptness from the distance , was a beautiful object .	3999.7749125934797
She was humbled , she was grieved ;	3959.247848309804
He who , she had been persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest enemy , seemed , on this accidental meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance , and without any indelicate display of regard , or any peculiarity of manner , where their two selves only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister .	2953.2176298979766
Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received , in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense .	4253.385985102591
By the Author of Sense and Sensibility .	5314.7076966220275
These are heavy misfortunes , replied Elizabeth .	5205.3860553634095
and I assure you , I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement .	2518.044204931271
I felt nothing but surprise .	6321.2426108881355
Did he know of their intending to go off ?	7568.049975875854
Give my love to Colonel Forster , I hope you will drink to our good journey .	4391.504918155664
Lady Catherine has been of infinite use , which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use .	3494.6810430173655
Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers' names and connections .	5867.436777903774
That she should have walked three miles so early in the day , in such dirty weather , and by herself , was almost incredible to Hurst and Miss Bingley ;	3113.991041314536
she continued to declare that she would , and the argument ended only with the visit .	3740.495252603864
for else they will be destitute enough .	6526.97643432527
We were married , you know , at Clement's , because Wickham's lodgings were in that parish .	4099.029437412132
A great deal more passed at the other table .	4979.154876507514
They descended the hill , crossed the bridge , and drove to the door ;	4672.346349366715
But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her , so soon after this event .	4299.006978940686
The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte's situation , and his expectation of a young olive-branch .	3646.0123674735946
I never thought Darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do .	3058.4833863983004
The children , two girls of six and eight years old , and two younger boys , were to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane , who was the general favourite , and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way teaching them , playing with them , and loving them .	3102.213244064903
He arranges the business just as he pleases .	5634.748136864398
I have a warm , unguarded temper , and I may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him , and to him , too freely .	2312.599779337639
Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth .	4754.170405732405
and had I been the rector of Longbourn , I should very strenuously have opposed it .	3137.0019715688904
A little sea-bathing would set me up for ever .	4862.479600744839
a most convenient distance for the young ladies , who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week , to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner's shop just over the way .	3749.1347609449817
Oh !	5043.244884590713
Elizabeth would not observe her ;	5711.349857516291
After sitting a few minutes , they were all sent to one of the windows , to admire the view , Collins attending them to point out its beauties , and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer .	2811.0905503270465
The others then joined her , and expressed their admiration of his figure ;	4349.604076924684
I wish I could hear that you , my dearest friend , had any intention of making one in the croud , but of that I despair .	3158.5119786906907
We will go as far as Meryton with you , said Catherine and Lydia .	3421.9159739882925
I hope they will not meet at all .	3093.8575282456864
Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom , which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family .	4137.672256400976
Collins knew not what to make of him .	4257.17612419322
One came from her books , and the other from her toilette .	4779.363355485881
Very well .	10415.764999866147
She could not determine how her mother would take it ;	3770.1138627632577
And have you answered the letter ?	7248.605565608471
Pemberley was now Georgiana's home ;	11854.260902089154
I am very sensible , madam , of the hardship to my fair cousins , and could say much on the subject , but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate .	2455.548124448974
my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ?	3332.0317849901076
Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House , whichever it might be , where Darcy then was .	4005.7664016316535
Gracechurch-street , Sept .	17904.861393725707
All connection between us seemed now dissolved .	8848.921326540074
He keeps a man-servant , does he ?	6743.724409514664
It was lady Catherine de Bourgh .	3388.6641415657864
She is so fond of Forster , said she , it will be quite shocking to send her away !	2689.1000270383943
my dear Charlotte , impossible !	8854.837303941296
and I doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself , Darcy .	3245.920990238102
CHAPTER XIX .	11147.934488852214
and after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family .	2228.381669279038
What will be his surprise , thought she , when he knows who they are !	4107.067966779773
For a few moments , indeed , she felt that he would probably strike into some other path .	3837.3669098286923
He was angry .	6655.315888827479
A man who has once been refused !	6475.646483156727
most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman's education .	3776.850980389763
Upon my word , said Gardiner , I begin to be of your uncle's opinion .	3482.5147818681203
She had no fear of its spreading farther , through his means .	4342.466361005687
Nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination , said Elizabeth .	3495.1645404426667
Do you draw ?	10362.703243086766
You go to Brighton !	6670.725524362757
and the others were to meet us at the church .	3987.3393853780735
No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you , can think any thing wanting .	5226.30212596525
He added , that Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present , to leave London , and promised to write again very soon .	3526.9392102920674
How I long to see her !	5735.542633926156
Elizabeth made no answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Darcy , and reading in her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it .	3010.1853128180637
Miss Bingley saw , or suspected enough to be jealous ;	5120.665019869625
and , though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy's father , five years before , it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends , than she had been in the way of procuring .	2663.252919574786
The business of her life was to get her daughters married ;	4688.645756449794
Darcy took her advice , and did finish his letter .	4859.092477744054
Bingley was good looking and gentleman-like ;	7581.2303328695225
Had not my own feelings decided against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man , who has been the means of ruining , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ?	3212.6905947792948
if I should ever go to Brighton , I would behave better than Lydia .	4869.534814982487
It is I believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world .	3059.374253594694
She felt it so ;	5997.276222929418
and when Bennet joined them at supper , his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was .	3571.9815823034746
Elizabeth felt Jane's pleasure .	6804.5871326800425
Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal , and felt persuaded of her sister's ready acquiescence .	4166.419804365963
But I will no longer importune my young cousin .	4232.237756060458
Then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce Bingley to her .	2513.914836287382
That he was really fond of Jane , she doubted no more than she had ever done ;	3316.1475094753096
At present , however , I consider myself as quite fixed here .	3969.1610850237885
a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification ;	7309.847155776605
Mary and Kitty were both with Bennet : one communication would , therefore , do for all .	3989.310255639688
unless when some barbarous neighbour , who could not be enough detested , had given him an invitation to dinner , which he thought himself obliged to accept .	3807.5845712162054
Had she not seen him in Derbyshire , she might have supposed him capable of coming there , with no other view than what was acknowledged ;	3859.452309432089
She dreaded seeing Wickham again , and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible .	3166.6528735209913
How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton !	5507.452496766924
why did she come ?	15352.639769589106
Darcy was writing , and Miss Bingley , seated near him , was watching the progress of his letter , and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister .	2824.8773026015942
Why did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight ?	6043.905464564171
They must be a great loss to your family .	4060.3501043734727
And on the gentlemen's approaching , one of the girls moved closer to her than ever , and said , in a whisper , The men shan't come and part us , I am determined .	2827.517223805965
and it was not till Easter-day , almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival , that they were honoured by such an attention , and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening .	2481.6072627864187
Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room , and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless .	3547.740322806174
( by the bye , Forster and me are such friends ) and so she asked the two Harringtons to come , but Harriet was ill , and so Pen was forced to come by herself ;	4007.091472802275
The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow .	3984.024370569262
At first there seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely , for she was a most determined talker ;	4310.449112255448
They were of a respectable family in the north of England ;	4528.187372204541
though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy .	5391.882888074535
Bennet was not in the habit of walking , Mary could never spare time , but the remaining five set off together .	3005.64168030942
Accordingly , when she retired at night , she asked the chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place , what was the name of its proprietor , and with no little alarm , whether the family were down for the summer .	3537.8876369203417
But if you will listen to his letter , you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself .	3188.0370933492663
She is a very headstrong foolish girl , and does not know her own interest ;	3194.4078077137115
I had often seen him in love before .	3939.519860731134
Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion , sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation .	4475.456678635092
consequently that she is aunt to the present Darcy .	6682.507593388202
Miss Bingley did the same ;	6802.268012310216
Elizabeth did all she could , to shield him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification ;	3007.52010697525
In that county , there was enough to be seen , to occupy the chief of their three weeks ;	3537.014388693867
You and papa , and my sisters , must come down and see us .	4430.495984138859
but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley , she dropt all her resentment ;	3957.14963773133
for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire , and of his being gone into the regulars .	3241.3419279129166
The motive professed , was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known , as to make it impossible for any young woman of character , to love or confide in him .	2844.253918374922
If he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare , he determined to make enquiries there , and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach .	3536.7464442548526

I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say .	3150.9189224786023
I do not trust my own partiality .	3659.6670135816944
Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits .	3989.9222891120444
In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her a present from my master ;	4730.6061322491605
And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock .	4686.29794889263
You cannot be more than twenty , I am sure , therefore you need not conceal your age .	2859.027093096062
and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment .	3001.83629077661

But if you have got them to-day , said Elizabeth , my mother's purpose will be answered .	3198.775584511968
And when I returned home , the shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time .	4192.511429767475
I could not have parted with you , my Lizzy , to any one less worthy .	2936.1441317313675
and he and Bennet spent the morning together , as had been agreed on .	3779.953256745036
made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow's debts , and got him his commission !	5458.1306819937445
You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works , reports , performances and research .	4373.607323586491
On entering the room , he seemed to hesitate ;	5019.606115250789
I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it .	3556.500533216042
Sometime hence it will be all found out , and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before .	3921.2407085173786
or had you intended any more serious consequence ?	8285.810471207791
I am trying to make it out .	3064.070058148243
I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet , she is really a very sweet girl , and I wish with all my heart she were well settled .	2736.6673397873706
I am not one and twenty .	3112.460569275015
Will it not be advisable , before we proceed on this subject , to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request , as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties ?	3506.1257768765176
I am afraid you do not like your pen .	2796.2000806144297
Then , after a short silence , he continued , Lizzy , I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May , which , considering the event , shews some greatness of mind .	3142.2746927915146
It was as follows : MY DEAR SIR , I feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire .	2942.9989035713634
Her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved .	8265.895194682427
I admire all my three sons-in-law highly , said he .	4080.223803743183
I should be sorry indeed , if it were .	3125.656996051458
Darcy made no answer .	4806.000992258068
Darcy , you cannot deny the fact .	5504.421383860626
and within five miles of Lambton , Elizabeth found from her aunt , that Pemberley was situated .	4169.340652286757
I have never heard him say so ;	3763.0126300557745
and his answering immediately to the last question Oh !	3582.0259834447497
Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness , and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover , she could not prevent its frequently recurring .	3577.9073313441245
Darcy mentioned his letter .	7731.090782569251
Kitty , to her very material advantage , spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters .	4045.237806470711
but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away , just as they were all getting so intimate together .	2797.22646679561
But I tell you what , Miss Lizzy , if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at all and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead .	2430.437535207955
I will not be interrupted .	3702.7501440199726
I desire you will do no such thing .	3870.5914461942525
Elizabeth did not know what to make of it .	2346.81258055744
Elizabeth said nothing , but it gratified her exceedingly ;	4801.205297415124
I will answer for it he never cared three straws about her .	3599.293767614745
I am grieved , indeed , cried Darcy ;	3057.3243994677973
And now here's Bennet gone away , and I know he will fight Wickham , wherever he meets him , and then he will be killed , and what is to become of us all ?	2945.192953763324
Gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her .	3662.545633589548
Yes if Darcy does not put it off again .	5280.062113067743
but it would not do ;	4692.05364609008
Since the shire were first quartered in Meryton , nothing but love , flirtation , and officers , have been in her head .	4132.286201933082
and , after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt , her resentment gave way , either to her affection for him , or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself ;	2694.3022030307925
I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing .	2998.300443746879
I have been making the tour of the Park , he replied , as I generally do every year , and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage .	2851.773027767976
Perhaps he thought her too young .	8853.616873336176
The fishing scheme had been renewed the day before , and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon .	3352.389592482371
I am not so selfish , however , as to press for it , if inconvenient .	2297.16338314882
I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself .	3697.6290229697356
What he told me was merely this ;	6643.456504701118
To Elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ;	3208.2323784465975
Hill began instantly to express her joy .	9181.183656304162
but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes , and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt .	4106.221943033892
Indeed !	26754.44043837987
There is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King .	5259.792545801234
Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish ;	5007.842471975528
My dear Lizzy , do not give way to such feelings as these .	2970.9498623906843
in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of every thing , she was still dear to him .	2815.1535305631583
The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's match , which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true !	3080.6546910241423
A military life is not what I was intended for , but circumstances have now made it eligible .	5078.925770951778
And , besides , no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road .	4214.501807894167
She was roused from her seat , and her reflections , by some one's approach ;	3486.9414874226645
She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken .	5594.426837689329
it is of no consequence .	7827.989096058912
Elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion , that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Bingley's invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's amusement ;	2660.7158078871207
In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty ;	3576.9252589815833
A most delightful place !	10273.169459448669
To Kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected .	4041.259836389444
We may compare our different opinions .	7992.9063410008375
This will never do .	7588.263394762581
the door was then allowed to be shut , and the carriage drove off .	3874.1999701810064
such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her , and she began her song .	3503.0758395876255
Lydia gaped as he opened the volume , and before he had , with very monotonous solemnity , read three pages , she interrupted him with , Do you know , mama , that my uncle Philips talks of turning away Richard , and if he does , Colonel Forster will hire him .	3386.7602758041826
CHAPTER XVIII .	12871.90986889334
You know nothing of the matter .	3796.8955424725377
Sir William did not say much .	6471.664407242968
She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico , muslin , and cambric , and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders , had not Jane , though with some difficulty , persuaded her to wait , till her father was at leisure to be consulted .	3179.9476327597677
but , had she still felt any , it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself , on seeing her again .	3228.7984991569765
He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance , and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption ;	3688.754728626757
Insolent girl !	23113.64370500188
but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful .	4064.249050998845
While she spoke , Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words , or to distrust their meaning .	4377.622747957041
and when she had gone through the whole letter , though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two , put it hastily away , protesting that she would not regard it , that she would never look in it again .	2438.6317263889896
Oh !	5043.244884590713
Painful recollections will intrude , which cannot , which ought not to be repelled .	5542.524640670861
Allowing for the common demands of the game , Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth , and she was very willing to hear him , though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told , the history of his acquaintance with Darcy .	2894.200142003869
He cannot know what Darcy is .	6107.084854619242
With the officers !	11879.292817431087
Charlotte says , she hardly ever does .	8831.25893103072
Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below .	6864.509700254092
I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady .	4430.883497930331
and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love .	3479.747108494556
Oh , yes !	5724.659857146617
You have deprived the best years of his life , of that independence which was no less his due than his desert .	4155.3333270287
No , no I feel he may defy us there .	4717.249859063633
It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy .	4219.293136174093
untamed , unabashed , wild , noisy , and fearless .	8481.978360694951
You look pale .	10667.058679749725
but , whenever she did catch a glimpse , she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said , she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed , however temporary its existence might prove , had at least outlived one day .	3068.2893063234073
but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly .	2984.442990338953
If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew , I shall certainly not be kept from it , by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss De Bourgh .	2918.9451469500777
but it is to the credit of his modesty .	4092.0431663737313
He was at the same time haughty , reserved , and fastidious , and his manners , though well bred , were not inviting .	3143.6260623912895
re-considering events , determining probabilities , and reconciling herself as well as she could , to a change so sudden and so important , fatigue , and a recollection of her long absence , made her at length return home ;	3470.5935671811153
The evening conversation , when they were all assembled , had lost much of its animation , and almost all its sense , by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth .	2855.4271029702186
CHAPTER II .	10741.208098788808
Can there be any other opinion on the subject ?	6010.790222895399
he will immediately comprehend what I must feel , and I rely upon his goodness .	4368.624151377797
Lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath ;	5092.781636193507
Depend upon it , my dear , that when there are twenty , I will visit them all .	3102.094778626249
She was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger , and wondered it had escaped her before .	3298.856890056258
It is highly improper .	5837.3744655456685
He leaves out half his words , and blots the rest .	5222.968692604547
To complete the favourable impression , she then told him what Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia .	4601.162901832972
and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to , a wish of being better acquainted with them , was expressed towards the two eldest .	3468.404763686259
Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring ?	7689.265347231674
She looks sickly and cross .	7915.381287784954
Upon my word , Caroline , I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by imitation .	3886.6194022544714
Who should suffer but myself ?	11387.858019326557
Your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach , that the contentment arising from them , is not of philosophy , but what is much better , of ignorance .	3916.465756123079
My father and mother knew nothing of that , they only felt how imprudent a match it must be .	3589.163893030727
I had much rather go in the coach .	4411.2708099127185
The adieu is charity itself .	7443.613712252848
I am truly glad , dearest Lizzy , that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes ;	2806.848436209273
Collins , did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe's calling yesterday to thank me ?	4695.674435132604
He is now perhaps sorry for what he has done , and anxious to re-establish a character .	3551.8167363594416
and if , as you were mounting your horse , a friend were to say , 'Bingley , you had better stay till next week , ' you would probably do it , you would probably not go and , at another word , might stay a month .	3236.338920802577
I have heard from authority , which I thought as good , that it was left you conditionally only , and at the will of the present patron .	2486.694899057211
Collins was eloquent in her praise .	7431.103263468609
but Elizabeth saw , with admiration of his taste , that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine ;	3494.3533933382805
Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room ;	3873.48741128817
As they walked across the lawn towards the river , Elizabeth turned back to look again ;	4636.29300713873
Oh , Lord !	7633.171293525679
Well , Jane , make haste and tell us ;	4609.955292127667
If you believed it impossible to be true , said Elizabeth , colouring with astonishment and disdain , I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far .	3016.3857686007195
I know you do ;	5069.419511811478
In confirmation of this , she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected , without actually naming her authority , but stating it to be such as might be relied on .	3135.297865368042
Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town ;	5113.388454867227
They were all astonished ;	6927.194041597838
I cannot believe it .	3246.571822910348
adding , with a significant smile , I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here .	3049.8312024964844
He answered her in the same style , and the subject dropped .	3670.468017414807
I would not be so fastidious as you are , cried Bingley , for a kingdom !	2991.440053471792
Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ;	4329.739367932477
Indeed I am .	11266.506402696756
Your profusion makes me saving ;	9911.717762976135
She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of ill humour , which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her .	2470.1103040276853
Oh !	5043.244884590713
She is a very fine-looking woman !	4059.681299712
and there was no necessity for such attention .	4308.854543973913
I was sometimes quite provoked , but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane , and for their sakes had patience with her .	2892.4826844955082
Are you so severe upon your own sex , as to doubt the possibility of all this ?	4004.348102836268
but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham ;	3652.915813836551
and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you .	2785.79750923447
That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment , as to refuse his daughter a privilege , without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid , exceeded all that she could believe possible .	3393.5605470084392
It must not be thought of .	5058.731709276936
Oh , Jane , had we been less secret , had we told what we knew of him , this could not have happened !	3260.8010743192426
Our instrument is a capital one , probably superior to You shall try it some day .	5388.445580133605
You thought the waiter must not hear , as if he cared !	5023.17118480402
said Elizabeth to herself .	6313.3897061066045
He protested that except Lady Catherine and her daughter , he had never seen a more elegant woman ;	3304.7104567309007
He was her dear Wickham on every occasion ;	4796.567948112164
You must contrive to send somebody .	5847.28367387427
Let me never see either one or the other again !	5562.931740692071
But why Darcy came so often to the Parsonage , it was more difficult to understand .	3846.5967859097277
Oh !	5043.244884590713
It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Darcy himself ;	3129.1261292700824
There is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair , on which I do not reflect with satisfaction ;	3086.6035071822453
A great many indeed , said her companion with a sigh .	4978.596523209151
Yes , my youngest is not sixteen .	6204.38053004768
Yes , Sir , I know I am .	3857.133030910373
She tried , however , to compose herself to answer him with patience , when he should have done .	3149.8571255717584
Sir William staid only a week at Hunsford ;	6767.773319539622
The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him .	3914.15233078316
his brow contracted , his air gloomy .	9184.290911904329
Only let me assure you , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage .	2932.6417459204627
Every thing nourishes what is strong already .	7682.906778700313
how I laughed !	13939.744802538027
but you must lend us the money , for we have just spent ours at the shop out there .	3870.6763991301727
His friend had left him that morning for London , but was to return home in ten days time .	4275.5877942272355
When Bennet arrived , he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure .	3775.8097609875917
I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character , in a part of the world , where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit .	2732.4047178786163
But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham .	3810.576261562528
Darcy had walked away to another part of the room .	3403.645396776509
Was not this some excuse for incivility , if I was uncivil ?	6099.260489303819
Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father , who had intended to purchase an estate , but did not live to do it .	3425.054660735802
that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that one false step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful , and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex .	3636.04153831977
Our importance , our respectability in the world , must be affected by the wild volatility , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia's character .	3670.3599791605384
I have found out , said he , by a singular accident , that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness .	2643.7491344233786
My dearest sister , now be be serious .	6303.586034601338
but Charlotte , she soon found , was depending on the plan , and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty .	3384.7093069915873
to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where , and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with .	3888.111599302606
Their mutual affection will steady them ;	7151.760500274555
He came , and in such very good time , that the ladies were none of them dressed .	3489.393690988991
and certainly ought not to have appeared ;	5273.085737070211
and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , I have not yet learnt to condemn them .	2811.0754455234296
But , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes time , and then we all set out .	3116.589361539101
and if the second , I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire .	3949.680227287162
Yes , she called yesterday with her father .	4759.87587691526
It is from Miss Bingley , said Jane , and then read it aloud .	2340.3935331103066
My poor father !	10348.952655359231
Elizabeth instantly read her feelings , and at that moment solicitude for Wickham , resentment against his enemies , and every thing else gave way before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness .	3224.918697635039
A thousand things may arise in six months !	7408.452651245942
We do not suffer by accident .	7910.81010748619
and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters , in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about .	3367.7409518275067
Your's , c .	7653.025158896742
Elizabeth almost stared at her .	5209.06206202674
Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time , but Darcy they had only seen at church .	4096.754698289963
Gracechurch-street , Monday , August 2 .	10102.497675403853
but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me .	3589.3307061796577
and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia's flight , on her own folly alone .	4077.9158530738414
She was received , however , very politely by them ;	2971.9848750747856
You must not be too severe upon yourself , replied Elizabeth .	3101.1779794767253
The country , said Darcy , can in general supply but few subjects for such a study .	3923.7284846652096
She had only to say in reply , that they had wandered about , till she was beyond her own knowledge .	3105.219489128084
His pride , in that direction , may be of service , if not to himself , to many others , for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by .	3533.7566971874717
I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation , replied Elizabeth , but it is not in my power to accept it .	1973.2834609344297
But he found , in reply to this question , that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country .	3497.2158901295306
Pride , observed Mary , who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections , is a very common failing I believe .	4494.45331940963
My friend has an excellent understanding though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Collins as the wisest thing she ever did .	3811.4036657925953
This was not very consoling to Bennet , and , therefore , instead of making any answer , she went on as before , I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate .	2774.4363469065024
in which case you may be sure of my pardon .	6679.741178765127
the windows are full west .	10383.574712647907
neither did the apothecary , who arrived about the same time , think it at all advisable .	5462.159060749844
The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this .	3229.7776561381943
Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls , and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him .	3116.0682194596316
You deserve no such attention .	6460.094419326481
for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend's dislike would vanish , if she could suppose him to be in her power .	3096.232787297224
The next morning , as she was going down stairs , she was met by her father , who came out of his library with a letter in his hand .	2715.2991019422084
Yet it did , and even a third .	7159.976715481601
I am glad he is gone .	3463.072820269367
There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself .	3362.880532344273
With such rivals for the notice of the fair , as Wickham and the officers , Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance ;	4276.410529676437
but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only .	4736.283836607992
Who could about such a nasty little freckled thing ?	7440.022391495389
A small sum could not do all this .	5515.698130936049
and having to relate such a thing of his sister !	4470.805471243397
Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt .	5523.030437132344
I almost envy you the pleasure , and yet I believe it would be too much for me , or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle .	3291.5009347692476
Oh !	5043.244884590713
Poor Charlotte !	20958.709985634305
She grew absolutely ashamed of herself .	5277.338835296098
Oh !	5043.244884590713
We must trespass a little longer on your kindness .	5480.998755558957
Philips's vulgarity was another , and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance ;	6709.200969154657
I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back .	3464.5553177233724
Had the late Darcy liked me less , his son might have borne with me better ;	5272.917356023016
Oh !	5043.244884590713
It would not be easy , indeed , to catch their expression , but their colour and shape , and the eye-lashes , so remarkably fine , might be copied .	3160.787653070518
And poor Darcy !	8732.245908913004
You are lucky in having such a master .	5092.882271623656
Is this to be endured !	9624.858423294501
Mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted ;	6186.176443072396
It was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re-animated , and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's attractions .	3103.7260397736636
I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side , for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing , if she had been well looked after .	2416.658292968773
It is Bingley I am sure .	2823.1002628009765
It cannot be for me , it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened .	3797.0087014493474
He had by that time reached it also , and holding out a letter , which she instinctively took , said with a look of haughty composure , I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you .	2835.1930402646394
the former continued the subject , by saying , But tell me all and every thing about it , which I have not already heard .	3208.10244675286
my dear Lydia , she cried , when shall we meet again ?	4647.797428564051
and sleeping one night on the road , reached Longbourn by dinner-time the next day .	3614.840895616166
Yes , I call it a very easy distance .	5073.550500024955
and then till her sister came down , she had to listen to all he had to say , of his own happiness , and of Jane's perfections ;	2699.8964334107886
Elizabeth immediately began playing again .	6039.7108667591065
Good gracious !	13026.898755758692
To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh ;	6074.281077490779
where , where is my uncle ?	10416.244482618637
And with no one to speak to , of what I felt , no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had !	3122.21013678788
How could I ever think her like her nephew ?	5696.026760844227
Within doors there was Lady Catherine , books , and a billiard table , but gentlemen cannot be always within doors ;	4575.113216955055
A house in town !	10279.429903976788
It seemed like wilful ill-nature , or a voluntary penance , for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away , but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her .	3117.3244344307536
I am going to Gretna Green , and if you cannot guess with who , I shall think you a simpleton , for there is but one man in the world I love , and he is an angel .	2369.2521457256107
But perhaps , added he , stopping in his walk , and turning towards her , these offences might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design .	3498.7847845902943
Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten ;	7607.110122728683
Well , well , and so Bingley is coming down , sister , ( for Philips first brought her the news ) Well , so much the better .	3053.090582549885
We never had any governess .	9053.48308127732
and no change was visible in either , except that the loss of her favourite sister , or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business , had given something more of fretfulness than usual , to the accents of Kitty .	3001.2095746180557
With the mention of Derbyshire , there were many ideas connected .	4885.818061440349
and detestable as such a step must make her were it known , she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go .	2977.245238761704
He seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologised for his intrusion , by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within .	3876.7530869532775
for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce .	4625.1948286964
With a stronger voice she soon added , I have this comfort immediately , that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side , and that it has done no harm to any one but myself .	2720.492003893499
and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane , received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth .	3516.0920566285276
Collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure , and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview , with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied , since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character .	3314.759494912166
but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy's opinion , and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities , by which some part of her family were connected with that corps .	2895.5589892362077
I suppose you have heard of it ;	3355.869885797132
VOL .	25580.072097342923
and , though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene .	2632.9431362167775
added Elizabeth ;	19045.437792855864
In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton and see how every body went on ;	3445.8301602890065
She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject , and related , with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration , the shocking rudeness of Darcy .	3285.516620585351
and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource , if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family , were unfavourably answered .	2844.0640962370926
But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible ;	4447.27137836393
I believe I have now told you every thing .	3628.744918750167
He did trace them easily to Clapham , but no farther ;	5027.7351983130875
This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers , but Bennet , who quarrelled with no compliments , answered most readily , You are very kind , sir , I am sure ;	3056.8432890389277
And gathering her work together , she was hastening away , when Elizabeth called out , Dear Ma'am , do not go .	3394.592511586623
for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him .	2995.069053071145
Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy , and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps .	3369.5122427430942
On the gentlemen's appearing , her colour increased ;	6656.091970010112
Oh !	5043.244884590713
yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said , You are mistaken , Darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way , than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner .	3066.7264352062584
and then thought no more of the matter : and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them , restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike .	3435.8239937243707
and in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard .	3457.1993907421593
as good natured , and as unaffected , though not quite so chatty .	5298.804558728076
for of what use could it apparently be to any one , that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him , should then be overthrown ?	3598.0737035943253
Oh !	5043.244884590713
He could number the fields in every direction , and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump .	4056.2739416726563
Bennet had very often wished , before this period of his life , that , instead of spending his whole income , he had laid by an annual sum , for the better provision of his children , and of his wife , if she survived him .	2744.0008745212876
His sisters were fine women , with an air of decided fashion .	4410.878466767017
On the following Monday , Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife , who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn .	3090.239358874469
Kitty has no discretion in her coughs , said her father ;	5623.4112266261645
she really rejoiced at it .	6008.836930533732
By many significant looks and silent entreaties , did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance , but in vain ;	4600.381728319591
He answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily .	2848.177705433027
and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion , that whenever Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate , it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at James's .	3130.0693772257946
Miss Lucas is married and settled .	7043.952733338479
Bingley was ready , Georgiana was eager , and Darcy determined , to be pleased .	4001.48964146264
and she could do nothing but think , and think with wonder , of Darcy's civility , and above all , of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister .	2747.4581067262743
Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight , and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister .	3963.7707607926627
The good news quickly spread through the house ;	6310.055154041039
Let us hope , therefore , that her being there may teach her her own insignificance .	4305.6904185242265
He seldom appeared really animated .	8170.1750330364885
Having now a good house and very sufficient income , he intended to marry ;	5929.941230041728
You refuse , then , to oblige me .	4212.136848328438
Miss Bingley I am sure cannot .	4560.122190904717
and , moreover , to enter into an engagement of allowing her , during your life , one hundred pounds per annum .	3643.1280170719456
After sitting a little while with Jane , on Miss Bingley's appearance and invitation , the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour .	4121.753420493902
names , facts , every thing mentioned without ceremony .	8132.883423041971
Lady Catherine seemed pleased .	6493.323994424477
Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest .	8314.151309668214
I have not that pain .	3570.711519227964
The ladies were somewhat more fortunate , for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window , that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse .	3637.0207240707796
he had a pleasant countenance , and easy , unaffected manners .	5148.211079566411
and I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body .	3391.410875110889
his civility , therefore , was most prompt in inviting Collins to join his daughters in their walk ;	4818.527250330993
But I knew I should persuade you at last .	3719.3845522370325
though it was not put in as it ought to be .	3865.879843656922
the agitations of former partiality entirely so .	7233.566757420253
but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune , part from her authoritative manner , and the rest from the pride of her nephew , who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class .	3203.801076393312
She was not the better pleased with his gallantry , from the idea it suggested of something more .	3338.60403555267
Sir William could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves .	3899.766212794064
The letter was to this effect : MY DEAR LIZZY , I wish you joy .	3932.931215136672
Your own heart , your own conscience , must tell you why I come .	5461.163195578629
without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person ;	8679.089695393866
and to Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction .	5325.703885360429
I wonder what he can be doing there .	4702.3703292526025
Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment ;	5906.270856884615
What , all five out at once ?	7299.138692827311
Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance , when you were in Kent ?	5355.072772332267
After walking several miles in a leisurely manner , and too busy to know any thing about it , they found at last , on examining their watches , that it was time to be at home .	3129.219898185922
but she does not know , no one can know how much I suffer from what she says .	3450.7558051519136
Wickham , after a few moments , touched his hat a salutation which Darcy just deigned to return .	3934.7393338828356
But , Lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it .	2467.7770061658475
Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss De Bourgh ate , pressing her to try some other dish , and fearing she were indisposed .	4958.509286454587
Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage .	5298.841211069009
But when her mother was gone , Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters .	2706.557281364726
What a stroke was this for poor Jane !	5941.43636376917
and she had barely time to express her satisfaction , and prepare for such a visitor , when Bingley's quick step was heard on the stairs , and in a moment he entered the room .	2501.2589561072664
Yes ;	10872.67006892519
Oh , yes !	5724.659857146617
Such a change in a man of so much pride , excited not only astonishment but gratitude for to love , ardent love , it must be attributed ;	4199.455266608424
I am sure , she added , if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and suffers a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without exception , the sweetest temper I ever met with .	2005.9164466720179
She was confident of having performed her duty , and to fret over unavoidable evils , or augment them by anxiety , was no part of her disposition .	3411.71044045959
You will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one .	4015.804251967323
She is a handsome girl , about fifteen or sixteen , and I understand highly accomplished .	3294.975501742211
repeated the other , as she ran into her room to prepare .	5346.624720307004
Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them ;	4988.043030147066
She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever ;	5348.51111859242
Lady Catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us , were the means of removing all my doubts .	5078.833679728741
I expected to find a more reasonable young woman .	4769.936454849712
Darcy , only for a few minutes to take leave , but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour , hoping for her return , and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found .	3226.1984069010514
Give me farther particulars .	14590.507435317855
do not repeat what I then said .	8543.191018158786
That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain , but I will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears .	3965.760477831617
Gardiner looked at her niece , desirous of knowing how she , whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its acceptance , but Elizabeth had turned away her head .	3668.4581578240363
He really believed , that were it not for the inferiority of her connections , he should be in some danger .	4289.24596315705
Her ladyship received them civilly , but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else ;	3256.7057990079015
Collins , said she , speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter ;	2783.4919381065106
He is just what a young man ought to be , said she , sensible , good humoured , lively ;	2764.6676877784143
And when we do return , it shall not be like other travellers , without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing .	3304.041396696983
Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection .	6925.972453911824
He simpers , and smirks , and makes love to us all .	4608.688561637288
I cannot understand it .	3246.222397252968
Can you , yourself , Lizzy , so wholly give him up , as to believe him capable of it ?	3347.048989274279
She was a woman of mean understanding , little information , and uncertain temper .	4100.591489849558
said Elizabeth , but the terms , I suppose , must be complied with .	3042.802645341616
Yes , Miss Bennet , interest ;	3869.6753169841963
The visit was returned in due form .	6353.377627497626
But Jane was to go home with her , and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation .	3303.1162205168
They were ignorant , idle , and vain .	4773.254790592198
Yes .	21496.56601277594
accompanied by a violent yawn .	13622.086203332536
Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other .	6584.591516648745
But who was your mother ?	7535.490015014229
Then pray speak aloud .	11837.442190024003
but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent .	4952.280421389464
And when her sisters abused it as ugly , she added , with perfect unconcern , Oh !	3090.882968699104
But if I go on , I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem .	3724.9719541225436
and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners , which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball .	3199.3821077966263
when it became apparent , that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match .	3597.3082333399993
and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance .	3857.5268072697504
But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world , replied Darcy .	2917.623921359501
and added , that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage .	3093.0905487899317
She highly approved his forbearance , and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other , as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn , and during the walk , he particularly attended to her .	2717.0238863454706
True .	28698.86935136358
Bennet , through the assistance of servants , contrived to have the earliest tidings of it , that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side , might be as long as it could .	2939.271081037013
Indeed you are mistaken .	8959.78263779353
Lizzy , to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family !	4063.626703055642
Not a soul knew of it , but and Forster , and Kitty and me , except my aunt , for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns ;	3567.850269150972
From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage , it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew ;	3821.9149693748277
That he was not a good-tempered man , had been her firmest opinion .	3592.9537048218076
She longed to see Philips , the Lucases , and all their other neighbours , and to hear herself called Wickham , by each of them ;	2934.0945696911367
Does your charge give you much trouble ?	9778.33753237484
It has been a very agreeable day , said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth .	3233.8594855883966
Can I have the carriage ?	8771.198452763121
CHAPTER V Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth ;	4704.621231645746
at his own house especially , and of a Sunday evening when he has nothing to do .	4196.378235035946
When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance , and courting the good opinion of people , with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace ;	3384.502914890599
And that made the men suspect something , and then they soon found out what was the matter .	3609.9499616883822
It must be something particular , to take him there at this time of year .	4127.164425996884
In what an amiable light does this place him !	5771.391495552758
The envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , hot pressed paper , well covered with a lady's fair , flowing hand ;	4318.792861791772
but the shortness of her stay , and yet more , the alteration of her manner , would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer .	3526.328077987277
Perhaps it would have been better ;	6264.672443787081
Have not you always hated him ?	8479.880892433968
but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence , what chance could there be of improvement ?	4712.930272170206
I am not now to learn , replied Collins , with a formal wave of the hand , that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first applies for their favour ;	2694.910540727381
for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible .	5512.538854924825
The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming ;	3796.547890466184
Elizabeth , who was left by herself , now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled , that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation .	3253.0746573563656
She could think of nothing else , and yet whether Bingley's regard had really died away , or were suppressed by his friends' interference ;	3517.2583464256386
And she was only sixteen last June .	6483.780132788167
I think you said she was a widow , sir ?	3798.206830950822
Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine , who called out to know what they were talking of .	4002.38348853345
I do assure you , that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain .	2853.175197009097
Many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter ;	6481.766053866218
Lady Catherine , I have nothing farther to say .	2708.510897777972
and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible .	2781.1454913265734
yet there had been that in his voice , which was not like ease .	5513.028009765382
But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Darcy's pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers ;	3886.0660877262694
He then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not tired , and they stood together on the lawn .	3597.370792034302
The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn .	4556.709663573289
Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these ;	7093.957521707684
Risk any thing rather than her displeasure ;	9879.891291362084
There was now an interest , however , in believing the housekeeper ;	3919.9801017993796
But his pride , his abominable pride , his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane , his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging , though he could not justify it , and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Wickham , his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny , soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited .	2806.603809743409
They are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses ;	4581.098759813415
Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's .	7879.841684322146
Well , I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Bingley .	2153.7838656537806
No governess !	14993.543752896529
But our visitor was very obstinate .	7264.792912431453
As a clergyman , moreover , I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence ;	3852.0512638580212
When she is secure of him , there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses .	3368.1266091600687
She had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses , which he had already had the honour of preaching before her .	2851.2779085957723
He drew a chair near her .	5122.762735682854
But whatever may be the sentiments which Wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character .	3849.1376199443025
Georgiana's reception of them was very civil ;	10251.939758739862
Oh !	5043.244884590713
But how did he account for it ?	4808.553498979681
Bennet was really in a most pitiable state .	5715.98028156134
My father is gone to London , and Jane has written to beg my uncle's immediate assistance , and we shall be off , I hope , in half an hour .	2686.7783035124335
Mary was the only daughter who remained at home ;	6403.006803122714
It is not Bingley , said her husband ;	3237.2279743206122
how unlucky !	19714.65895253849
Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as Elizabeth half expected Bingley to do , he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine's visit .	3738.845846911984
Do not copy , display , perform , distribute or redistribute this electronic work , or any part of this electronic work , without prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1 .	2917.346149597665
But , whatever may be their own wishes , it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother's .	3449.5428672797684
He then went away , and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself .	2661.4589238467593
is she handsome ?	18208.680175590514
She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could , provided he chose with discretion ;	3174.8368926119865
she knew not how to believe that Darcy could be so unworthy of Bingley's regard ;	4841.961001080609
I dare say you will find him very agreeable .	3732.0305576329215
That is right .	6999.6789555380765
and what can he have to say ?	4645.81217223352
His disposition must be dreadful .	7988.826698400947
But the fact is , that being , as I am , to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father , ( who , however , may live many years longer , ) I could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters , that the loss to them might be as little as possible , when the melancholy event takes place which , however , as I have already said , may not be for several years .	2601.6435142146574
and you shall all have a bowl of punch , to make merry at her wedding .	4119.721878043807
Till the next morning , however , she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance .	2818.2673802570107
If you are a good girl for the next ten years , I will take you to a review at the end of them .	2771.388050668073
Elizabeth loved absurdities , but she had known Sir William's too long .	4133.903006824304
Women fancy admiration means more than it does .	9145.428188276712
Your's sincerely , c .	8921.421845360357
I shall offer to pay him to-morrow ;	4658.046767650349
said she .	9106.608369586867
But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Wickham , when she read with somewhat clearer attention , a relation of events , which , if true , must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself , her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition .	3242.2333908108876
Almost as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life .	4271.436582588509
Oh !	5043.244884590713
and his sisters are charming women .	5417.735055487968
and will probably be much talked of .	5054.436924005139
and soon afterwards Darcy , drawing near Elizabeth , said to her Do not you feel a great inclination , Miss Bennet , to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel ?	2976.943547749838
I had not been long in Hertfordshire , before I saw , in common with others , that Bingley preferred your eldest sister , to any other young woman in the country .	2518.1707694256797
It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again !	4481.852252928754
You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this .	3673.6293021917377
The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed , the unacknowledged were silent .	5071.681655581205
Very true ;	17800.069373763294
I should be sorry to think so ill of him , in the very beginning of our relationship .	2480.6774017903576
But on returning to the drawing-room , when her letter was finished , she saw , to her infinite surprise , there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her .	2670.8631354338545
and Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected .	5489.707641531765
He then said , I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly .	3315.821746048818
four or five thousand a year .	8358.198534746718
they are all silly and ignorant like other girls ;	7046.6341283283655
Collins was not a sensible man , and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society ;	3321.066655233775
I am going to open the instrument , Eliza , and you know what follows .	3082.2121846230298
His fear of her , has always operated , I know , when they were together ;	3726.642933727605
nor will I be dissuaded from it .	6251.831033688253
Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it , and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards ;	2967.9967151780115
You have liked many a stupider person .	5460.48018866717
I will go to Meryton , said she , as soon as I am dressed , and tell the good , good news to my sister Philips .	2290.0718676253914
He brought it with him for us to see .	5225.469030618673
I have done with you from this very day .	3700.339425049236
and thither also went Wickham , undoubtedly by design ;	5792.014792427834
there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance !	6104.977205754321

Yet he knew to the contrary himself .	7477.774899742039
but that after their removal , it had been every where discussed ;	4663.40833561893
but since we see every day that where there is affection , young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune , from entering into engagements with each other , how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if I am tempted , or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist ?	3252.307275583977
yes , his misfortunes have been great indeed .	6763.122594850735
she repented , though she hardly knew of what .	6137.890329510127
And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him , without any reason .	3715.212901929526
Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse , and that she could not leave her .	2504.0106772329145
But people themselves alter so much , that there is something new to be observed in them for ever .	3446.7075657672754
Miss Darcy and her brother appeared , and this formidable introduction took place .	5060.341804116074
She related the subject of the pictures , the dimensions of the rooms , and the price of the furniture , in vain .	3475.217982569944
Yes , all of them , I think .	3344.8418950487485
If I was to go through the world , I could not meet with a better .	3091.957777421417
What , is he coming home , and without poor Lydia !	4873.775054655106
At our time of life , it is not so pleasant I can tell you , to be making new acquaintance every day ;	3382.7329619523584
I would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ;	3491.5408851339184
I talked about the dance , and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room , or the number of couples .	3039.155437757799
I had not thought Darcy so bad as this though I have never liked him , I had not thought so very ill of him I had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general , but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge , such injustice , such inhumanity as this !	2891.696369749757
E Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg : 1 .	5670.854887623225
and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn , they would be going there for ever .	3533.349183431595
As for the gentleman himself , his feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence .	3917.6764265048114
inmates of the same house , sharing the same amusements , objects of the same parental care .	5664.874470702031
But what is to be done about Pemberley ?	4267.913187439113
In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage .	6004.475995866805
And men take care that they should .	6309.258598798445
Elizabeth accepted their company , and the three young ladies set off together .	3378.7869950700906
They may be modified and printed and given away you may do practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks .	4816.360858455346
Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball ;	3645.5512962236116
She plays and sings all day long .	5839.310978972966
Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern .	6579.6573837058995
The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl .	5273.869705231666
and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries , which Jane was equally eager to satisfy .	3925.411449486049
such an openness and gentleness in his manner .	7420.409983194527
The discomposure of spirits , which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into , could not be easily overcome ;	3746.345253170841
Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages .	5550.387860513632
and even Jane , who believed still less of it , became almost hopeless , more especially as the time was now come , when if they had gone to Scotland , which she had never before entirely despaired of , they must in all probability have gained some news of them .	2689.186242775349
But I wonder how long you would have gone on , if you had been left to yourself .	2908.672393176128
You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you .	3486.946203832225
Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Collins , and I will never see you again if you do .	2397.188100398128
whichever were the case , though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference , her sister's situation remained the same , her peace equally wounded .	4111.633682119627
To be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation , had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town ;	3072.35246043178
The possibility of Collins's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two ;	3574.6291424797537
coaxed and threatened her by turns .	10954.929726605296
The housekeeper came ;	7905.713455674274
She was of great use and comfort to us all , and lady Lucas has been very kind ;	3669.2355992044536
and I trust I am resigned .	4513.860108254853
Perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her .	4065.6509766506783
if that is all , I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire ;	4333.546809944767
Not that I care about it , though .	5381.043144023652
Howsoever that may be , you are grievously to be pitied , in which opinion I am not only joined by Collins , but likewise by lady Catherine and her daughter , to whom I have related the affair .	3190.584918703411
Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public .	5686.342839734807
The comfort to her , of the regiment's approaching removal , was indeed beyond expression .	3772.6653915696043
so easily guided that his worth was invaluable ;	8343.355094417555
his estate there is a noble one .	7308.223372897162
and as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together .	3214.0092874196957
Wickham !	22062.624837910855
but Lydia , with perfect indifference , continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter , and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day , as he was going the next morning to London .	2263.64202330043
and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected .	3708.6246428608224
No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph .	6106.781694018826
Assistance is impossible ;	17185.695153919813
They had , therefore , many acquaintance in common ;	4704.092440940982
To my fancy , it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men .	4010.5912822719783
Bennet said only , Nonsense , nonsense !	7867.172417167916
But does not Jane correspond with the sister ?	5874.0421713313035
I cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought , nor their offences against myself .	3407.061727258864
But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood , and take Pemberley for a kind of model .	3682.713524317258
Lord bless me !	15974.924056790915
till , roused to resentment by his subsequent language , she lost all compassion in anger .	5934.164531581785
How much you must have gone through !	6167.542357083037
Lady Catherine was a tall , large woman , with strongly-marked features , which might once have been handsome .	4030.3888200277624
But , perhaps he could not in her mother's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt .	2699.8115148552197
Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse .	8543.95545686632
Who would have thought she could be so thin and small !	5328.819710080223
And so was I You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner .	4241.217110682855
It is such a spur to one's genius , such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind .	3285.703121985696
That she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head .	4807.065200667896
it was impossible not to long to know .	4112.418503717632
She will drop the acquaintance entirely .	6274.329393136377
If you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits , and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment .	2450.176763280153
In the gallery there were many family portraits , but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger .	4093.441991993616
Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome ;	5298.6645251734235
We will settle with your father about the money afterwards ;	6126.099548165233
Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment .	6520.6550179869855
Bennet had no turn for economy , and her husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income .	4095.367821423168
He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him , nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity ;	3888.869918304088
and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time , than as she hoped that , by Caroline's not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him .	2614.9014997883837
But when she read , and re-read with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu , so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate .	3566.8356505800734
As for their mother , Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will , and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure , which astonished her husband and daughters .	3132.8848277328393
The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough ;	4616.351268858883
The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors , and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife , was exactly what he had wished for ;	3390.8787419431865
Teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind !	9050.923137771259
She would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions .	4575.152845994253
This will not do , said Elizabeth .	3695.4008059388775
Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage , and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at Rosings .	3442.7834186051728
He has the promise of an ensigncy in General 's regiment , now quartered in the North .	4164.2309764295105
and covering her face with her handkerchief , Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else ;	3902.0370800538967
It was a handsome modern building , well situated on rising ground .	3759.7111747571676
Oh , brother , how kind you are !	5558.170772067627
But if you are really innocent and ignorant , I must be more explicit .	3750.249326144363
Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she ceased speaking , replied thus , My dear Miss Elizabeth , I have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding , but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity , and those which regulate the clergy ;	2955.4032063657805
That is exactly what I should have supposed of you , said Elizabeth .	2453.8304524434
If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is , I shall know what to think .	2995.0546123089207
If she does not object to it , why should we ?	4341.915201066002
Having been frequently in company with him since her return , agitation was pretty well over ;	5212.879726561421
Philips visited them all , and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before .	4833.290114032953
Yours , c .	9844.561749886894
and so fervently did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets , which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity .	3172.686874598903
Louisa , you will not mind my waking Hurst .	6365.220183200467
I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much , and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help .	2574.1441633088066
but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on .	3274.6332156401713
Thank you , Sir , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me .	4647.009770954938
I think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements .	4427.610340830605
shall I get you one ?	13616.664970366763
Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication .	3537.6040588779224
CHAPTER II .	10741.208098788808
If your master would marry , you might see more of him .	3872.087869929522
From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane , and were indebted to Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along , and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton , which he never failed coming to inform them of , though it happened almost every day .	3207.34332951627
With three younger sisters grown up , replied Elizabeth smiling , your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it .	3878.3890487663134
and now , because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds , you want to find out that he is mercenary .	3063.0479355607317
Elizabeth , at work in the opposite corner , saw it all with great delight .	4208.230170834436
We now come to the point .	6008.305643793504
Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone ;	5425.551501071333
It had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought to be imitated , though it could not be equalled , by some exertion of politeness on their side ;	2804.6494841241956
Collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed .	4843.751107767743
If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set forth in this agreement , you must obtain permission in writing from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael Hart , the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark .	2450.6469610270096
The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions .	4663.03224822893
He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt's , where his regret and vexation , and the concern of every body was well talked over .	3510.251826286469
These causes must be stated , though briefly .	8485.383563185998
A little time therefore .	9910.662789549726
I did not wink at you .	3227.2892921414536
Some people call him proud ;	11013.68923345083
Darcy only smiled ;	11188.401254456294
and Collins have a comfortable income , but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance .	3335.32282331536
Elizabeth particularly , who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy , was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied .	3870.257141219304
I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun .	3556.792008780837
for in a quarter of an hour's t te- -t te with Bennet before breakfast , a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house , and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes , that a mistress for it might be found at Longbourn , produced from her , amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement , a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on .	3298.9205609606997
nor will such behaviour as this , ever induce me to be explicit .	5505.6561740460975
Upon my word , Sir , cried Elizabeth , your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration .	3836.8197844036463
Gardiner was a sensible , gentleman-like man , greatly superior to his sister , as well by nature as education .	3690.5715032076273
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly .	6521.611284902112
You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles , for you are wasting your time with me .	3632.925135210728
though I thought it would be very good fun if I was .	3676.7354826870646
Who is to fight Wickham , and make him marry her , if he comes away ?	4227.872112645588
She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country .	3088.1007060116003
Bennet treated the matter differently .	9431.93385979023
Follies and nonsense , whims and inconsistencies do divert me , I own , and I laugh at them whenever I can .	4128.896451064121
Gardiner abused her stupidity .	11614.442107688907
You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine , but which I have never acknowledged .	4165.123522362891
His character is thereby complete .	7980.079858425281
and Miss Lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon that establishment were gained .	3955.149025226897
but Sir William's good breeding carried him through it all ;	4959.645200293163
My youngest sister has left all her friends has eloped ;	6362.982576772194
I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments ;	4501.456782036723
and without any intention of coming back again .	3754.5434229535467
and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments .	5205.012773248698
They will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to Longbourn ;	4646.50891583849
Elizabeth looked archly , and turned away .	4868.7889670316945
I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world , and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns .	2920.790782008988
But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed , so doubtful , so indefinite , that it gives me very little idea .	3901.6884916432496
A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request , without waiting for arguments to reason one into it .	4050.6275574532506
so handsome !	18675.214717524133
The dinner too in its turn was highly admired ;	5711.461833865028
CHAPTER XVII .	11147.934488852214
one knows exactly what to think .	8333.698942022285
Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure ;	6102.174745352803
It was a rational scheme to be sure !	3443.1983913018394
though her spirits are greatly shaken .	9395.113694032927
As they passed through the hall , Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and drawing-room , and pronouncing them , after a short survey , to be decent looking rooms , walked on .	3156.0507861280844
CHAPTER V I have been thinking it over again , Elizabeth , said her uncle , as they drove from the town ;	3245.8246569242697
Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane .	5195.887304886975
She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage , and had a few minutes' conversation with Charlotte , but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out .	3111.8505598403335
But he had given a reason for his interference , which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief .	4209.137833997573
But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted .	3786.136748266542
and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself , is heightened into something still more interesting , from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister .	3296.256786093581
Upon this information , they instantly passed through the hall once more , and ran across the lawn after their father , who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock .	3423.2260649803143
and Gardiner smiled .	7975.39138451211
Do not you want to know who has taken it ?	4462.985195312668
While they were dressing , he came two or three times to their different doors , to recommend their being quick , as Lady Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner .	3963.4136522854124
and as soon as they were in the parlour , he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode , and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment .	2903.64702146752
He was directly invited to join their party , but he declined it , observing , that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together , with either of which motives his joining them would interfere .	3174.365013556453
pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before .	6901.2358894951185
I am sorry to say it of them , but so it is .	2679.377993244167
Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat , he suddenly addressed her with , I hope Bingley will like it Lizzy .	4572.979940482777
1 .	9967.378404281952
There is one point , on which I want your advice .	4273.803955068751
They then sat down , and when her enquiries after Rosings were made , seemed in danger of sinking into total silence .	3907.270695036691
I assure you , Madam , he replied , that she does not need such advice .	2137.622706992593
Her answer , therefore , was not propitious , at least not to Elizabeth's wishes , for she was impatient to get home .	3235.9751726489617
Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to Miss Darcy , without calling her attention .	2197.616993802761
They both set off , and the conjectures of the remaining three continued , though with little satisfaction , till the door was thrown open , and their visitor entered .	3348.7218915745902
I mend pens remarkably well .	5529.915794720882
He does not want abilities .	7471.789704001263
and though prepared , as he told Elizabeth , to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house , he was used to be free from them there ;	2921.245128365519
My situation in life , my connections with the family of De Bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ;	3712.336257104308
In Meryton they parted ;	9200.209284949795
You do not know what he really is ;	3668.718273814876
and , before she could reply , he added , It is above eight months .	3102.688948224852
We are each of an unsocial , taciturn disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room , and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb .	3683.223899123824
and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother , when they were met by the butler , who said , If you are looking for my master , ma'am , he is walking towards the little copse .	3094.8134298548207
whence , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods overspreading many , and occasionally part of the stream .	4070.9646964437043
I know you will contrive it all .	3326.318470117151
Their manner of living , even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home , was unsettled in the extreme .	4578.6648238805265
Oh , lord !	7018.246222296502
but when the living fell , it was given elsewhere .	3803.025938186235
the morning in bustle and shopping , and the evening at one of the theatres .	4004.8499492598917
The wedding took place ;	8066.4214655328515
These are conditions , which , considering every thing , I had no hesitation in complying with , as far as I thought myself privileged , for you .	3288.9402921614947
No aunt , no officers , no news could be sought after ;	6181.294077998985
but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity .	3343.0125471826977
cried Bingley .	11643.7463056345
We want none of them ;	6603.4025763891
cried Elizabeth .	6998.027216350108
Sir William , how can you tell such a story ?	5056.363831932994
Yes ;	10872.67006892519
How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate !	4892.076585524925
She longed to speak , but could think of nothing to say ;	3499.5779278445457
But the clothes , the wedding clothes !	5573.071171356562
Bennet and her daughters then departed , and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane , leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Darcy ;	3491.7975606666173
Do not imagine , Miss Bennet , that your ambition will ever be gratified .	3543.92845174877
we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster's .	5835.384164419132
How humiliating is this discovery !	9339.692961248946
and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage ;	4898.837513153522
but I do not think there would have been any fun in it .	2138.9881184181786
It is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us .	3833.3265616763856
Not one party , or scheme , or any thing .	4373.954285832871
He replied , and was again silent .	4562.818920412002
So far each recital confirmed the other : but when she came to the will , the difference was great .	4568.953184163582
I dare say Bingley will be very glad to see you ;	2688.5148781849816
Here you are in your own family .	6835.569643214296
Since her father's death , her home has been London , where a lady lives with her , and superintends her education .	4168.221394598386
Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire , paid his compliments , with his usual reserve , to Collins ;	3144.0140602416936
Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter , Darcy must speak for himself .	4278.533756006293
You are a gentleman's daughter .	4713.261139081305
I do not recollect that we did .	3109.207739740194
As soon as they were gone , Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits ;	3626.63427377929
and have such tremblings , such flutterings , all over me , such spasms in my side , and pains in my head , and such beatings at heart , that I can get no rest by night nor by day .	3229.1009377633513
Jane shook her head .	7134.10815301943
Upon my word I say no more here than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood , except Netherfield .	3711.911630299938
You are quite a visit in my debt , Bingley , she added , for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us , as soon as you returned .	2644.372631396149
for , by the bye , you are to understand , that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them .	2483.123931360344
but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation .	3365.1583188401864
Let me know every thing that I am to know , without delay .	4250.813485862884
Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him , but this step ( and let us rejoice over it ) marks nothing bad at heart .	4572.671078432399
Yes , replied Darcy , who could contain himself no longer , but that was only when I first knew her , for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance .	2692.8256530750673
I ask only a comfortable home ;	5996.033292473334
I certainly shall not .	5311.649275743773
I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us .	3183.4510284998673
When they get to our age I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do .	3650.5699548144044
Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine , was in a different style ;	4822.402401964749
and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it .	2742.932271688956
Bennet was doubly engaged , on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane , who sat some way below her , and on the other , retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases ;	3017.291720916293
Charlotte had seen them from her husband's room , crossing the road , and immediately running into the other , told the girls what an honour they might expect , adding , I may thank you , Eliza , for this piece of civility .	3651.7340578679837
It has been coming on so gradually , that I hardly know when it began .	3557.4334552860514
she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression .	6117.9699521360135
yes the handsomest young lady that ever was seen ;	7262.215758758149
It is not that I do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman's of superior execution .	3163.6433325458465
How much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow !	4515.981564313058
Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance , mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste .	4660.401746527862
My aunt Philips wants you so to get husbands , you can't think .	4805.48956704658
It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next , and a still greater , that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again , and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits , by all that affection could do .	2872.892783406082
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood , this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families , that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters .	3536.3211326788623
Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified , never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting .	4906.09684730178
Next to being married , a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then .	5413.514130790087
Make haste , and come down this moment .	7791.107487584917
Now I have got some news for you , said Lydia , as they sat down to table .	3414.852721450268
what has she to do with it ?	7453.936744087533
Its windows opening to the ground , admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house , and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn .	3689.848185291029
That is to say , you had given your permission .	4429.762215094012
One may be continually abusive without saying any thing just ;	7118.411394038437
no it is not for me to be driven away by Darcy .	4301.2843252808
There was now employment for the whole party ;	4742.772104050093
The expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity .	4980.538774221317
I shall certainly try to get the better .	3099.164734203409
She read over her aunt's commendation of him again and again .	4142.452656507542
How is half such a sum to be repaid ?	6718.984634706917
and depend upon it , Bingley never stirs without him .	3204.8303998512
we are all in an uproar .	9938.293192299798
If , in the explanation of them which is due to myself , I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your's , I can only say that I am sorry .	2821.6721568596527
Wont it , Kitty ?	16183.008059896378
Oh !	5043.244884590713
This accounted to Elizabeth for Wickham's being among them .	5341.610152052004
I shall now know how to act .	4658.714788100181
I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of the covies for you .	2463.063631932786
Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister , that they did not once sit down to a family dinner .	3232.763913536858
But I shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity of your sister's countenance and air was such , as might have given the most acute observer , a conviction that , however amiable her temper , her heart was not likely to be easily touched .	3109.2995727160837
Who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly !	4025.1572617597253
He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place , and his intrigues , all honoured with the title of seduction , had been extended into every tradesman's family .	2931.230798346302
Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment ;	5980.7568514543245
But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being withheld from seeing Jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless .	2577.8031975299027
CHAPTER VIII .	12871.90986889334
Long said so too , for I asked her whether you did not .	4813.24443300864
E8 .	35290.54376147641
That is very strange .	6881.512736019269
Oh !	5043.244884590713
It was a subject which they could not mention before me .	2841.0432191823056
But when you have had time to think it all over , I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done .	2497.1745649903446
and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits ;	2931.391132055274
That is a question which Darcy only can answer .	4281.522448032873
You were not by , when I told mamma , and the others , all about it .	2655.9941003204126
When Darcy returned to the saloon , Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister .	2789.3771925159394
But that is one great difference between us .	4634.714478972767
Her mother stepped forwards , embraced her , and welcomed her with rapture ;	4482.903735626126
The express was sent off directly .	6361.928423771489
Could he expect that her friends would not step forward ?	6845.372132173829
Darcy !	12692.46521465058
and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature , by the testimony so highly in his favour , and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light , which yesterday had produced .	3333.538969240981
It is impossible for me to be impartial .	3497.4879639764963
Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love ;	5117.675088283215
But vanity , not love , has been my folly .	5360.941807810106
His understanding and opinions all please me ;	6211.014915419571
When the party broke up , Lydia returned with Forster to Meryton , from whence they were to set out early the next morning .	3573.447485112095
and she spoke very little , except in a low voice , to Jenkinson , in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable , and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said , and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes .	2855.4953578334726
but he soon afterwards said , I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month .	3336.7974359180575
and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise , and owned she encouraged it as much as possible .	3127.9732751644956
Yes , very different .	6464.472285172301
Jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening .	3975.2772854254213
She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue , while in town , for the recovery of his daughter .	3138.6307287569794
A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth ;	3720.829760666171
Jones says we must not think of moving her .	6331.169028681167
Why does she not come in ?	9111.757229574398
By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure ;	5997.745902952094
And that is quite impossible ;	7052.222932650769
An hour , however , saw the whole completed ;	6096.259708307003
Her sisters were uneasy for her , but her mother was delighted .	4315.07091092278
or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour .	4752.119969147814
You must decide for yourself , said Elizabeth , and if upon mature deliberation , you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife , I advise you by all means to refuse him .	2675.9739882709328
and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions .	3873.2082055965284
after going over so many , she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains .	5767.107247666574
Very few days passed in which Collins did not walk to Rosings , and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise ;	3710.088690087989
Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject ;	4584.495670792274
CHAPTER XV .	11147.934488852214
Never , even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield , or his dignified relations at Rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from self-consequence , or unbending reserve as now , when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed , would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings .	3395.9162332260203
He has given in all his debts ;	5449.66943738075
CHAPTER VII .	11147.934488852214
Shall you like to have such a brother ?	8003.603629391893
Oh !	5043.244884590713
Your affectionate friend , LYDIA BENNET .	8929.154554940511
Did it , said he , did it soon make you think better of me ?	3994.378917470188
she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library .	6282.368235030255
However , he wrote some verses on her , and very pretty they were .	4526.379759613536
and at length , by repeated assurances that Darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the test of many months suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father's incredulity , and reconcile him to the match .	3256.1744282728664
It is more than I engage for , I assure you .	2463.915224474343
He walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very great !	4482.314283087847
As soon as they entered the copse , Lady Catherine began in the following manner : You can be at no loss , Miss Bennet , to understand the reason of my journey hither .	3005.488901923005
To his tacit engagement with Miss De Bourgh ?	5946.467787710425
Elizabeth , having rather expected to affront him , was amazed at his gallantry ;	4399.1532008415825
But at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went sorely against the grain ;	3175.7135921941267
What a pity it is , mamma , we did not all go .	4293.1093472943885
But Bennet , was not so well pleased with it .	3209.7157713836336
Tell me once for all , are you engaged to him ?	6307.83451143527
What a good joke it will be !	5116.364689639669
Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her .	3988.5048591533046
and as they entered the house , he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men ;	2759.5966576854603
and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary .	3928.8843948599806
He would scarcely be ten pounds a-year the loser , by the hundred that was to be paid them ;	3639.214091021158
If such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy !	4617.9188244943225
Jane , who was not so light , nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth , soon lagged behind , while her sister , panting for breath , came up with him , and eagerly cried out , Oh , Papa , what news ?	2821.6907496752788
said Elizabeth .	8045.34531137579
I shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on .	3173.065285128339
He had never had the slightest suspicion .	5620.112751759941
But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him , as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage ?	3199.1118863517027
and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley , which might only grieve her sister farther .	2973.8372517201947
He sat down for a few moments , and then getting up walked about the room .	2607.1252235120255
Elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well ;	3486.524360307622
Her daughter , Miss de Bourgh , will have a very large fortune , and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates .	3402.5904118591634
And we mean to treat you all , added Lydia ;	5595.976485421135
for he is now in the custody of his friend , and Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London !	3335.0879336942908
Pursuing her way along the lane , she then began it .	5180.297122949615
She was disappointed , and angry with herself for being so .	3934.732106486885
She had been unwilling to mention Bingley ;	4239.910855422799
He is , indeed .	5305.295671429808
He was exactly what he had been , when I knew him in Hertfordshire ;	2605.5626846727623
How can Bingley , who seems good humour itself , and is , I really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ?	3506.528194625929
She has a very good notion of fingering , though her taste is not equal to Anne's .	4003.0726767539218
Haye-Park might do , said she , if the Gouldings would quit it , or the great house at Stoke , if the drawing-room were larger ;	3618.066839233746
We were born in the same parish , within the same park , the greatest part of our youth was passed together ;	4055.8546515339553
CHAPTER II .	10741.208098788808
but with respect to any other leading characteristic , I do not imagine that much has been unfolded .	3265.4942187026313
When you told Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes , you meant it to be a sort of panegyric , of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone , and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else ?	3510.6278373514574
for to her inexpressible vexation , she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Darcy , who sat opposite to them .	3005.947190012867
It is wonderful , replied Wickham , for almost all his actions may be traced to pride ;	3837.0399389490403
At length , however , our kind friend procured the wished-for direction .	3819.0967111683703
I think I have heard you say , that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton .	2981.1068332814516
advice , which there was every reason to believe would be attended to ;	6271.761937027396
Elizabeth looked surprised .	8612.575132337677
I do not cough for my own amusement , replied Kitty fretfully .	3605.095719488813
To Rosings he then hastened to console Lady Catherine , and her daughter ;	3626.3112780043
I am astonished , said Miss Bingley , that my father should have left so small a collection of books .	2661.147085804307
I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly .	4826.334575043572
I was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off , and then I should have gone quite distracted .	2935.248595326345
they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money , great connections , and pride .	4607.999520248691
he continued after a pause , on seeing Bingley join the group ;	5793.351795911152
and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin .	3786.3757182030104
Of this she was perfectly unaware ;	9411.810513643068
'Tis too much !	17915.492548608225
Not a syllable was uttered by either ;	7369.552541743388
Your's , very sincerely , M GARDINER .	8583.129097368308
Collins had a compliment , and an allusion to throw in here , which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter .	4154.602917958978
I have not the pleasure of understanding you , said he , when she had finished her speech .	1878.197317286013
But these things happen so often !	6775.769152089929
The suspicions which had just arisen of Darcy and their niece , directed their observation towards each with an earnest , though guarded , enquiry ;	4333.08371315555
and quitting them both , he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton , denominated from that period Lucas Lodge , where he could think with pleasure of his own importance , and unshackled by business , occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world .	3085.6628165135585
I have not the smallest objection to explaining them , said he , as soon as she allowed him to speak .	1884.810321031685
F3 , a full refund of any money paid for a work or a replacement copy , if a defect in the electronic work is discovered and reported to you within <TIME_PERIOD > of receipt of the work .	3762.1991002439677
but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal , that her mother , though often disheartened , had never yet despaired of succeeding at last .	2770.7936987515886
He was quite young , wonderfully handsome , extremely agreeable , and to crown the whole , he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party .	2817.7557932471727
Such relief , however , as it was in her power to afford , by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences , she frequently sent them .	2852.87778561228
It was to be such a secret !	4020.7600723979995
and if he is disposed to make them any amends , I shall not be the person to discourage him .	2335.111616227691
His wish of introducing his sister to her , was a compliment of the highest kind .	3757.8231386039497
Again she read on .	10775.352210116003
Will you tell me how long you have loved him ?	5535.18625363141
After discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , Miss Lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight ;	2883.230679015493
Yes , and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise .	3653.728776691525
I never heard that it was .	2812.816182252445
they are certainly not gone to Scotland .	6436.430051255476
for it gratified him , he said , to discover that Charlotte Lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter !	2951.9826322136987
I did not expect such a compliment .	3781.1034275031507
Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other , and the waiter was told that he need not stay .	3220.7925208815504
She watched him whenever they were at Rosings , and whenever he came to Hunsford ;	4011.3026019806252
Their party in the dining-room was large , for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news : and various were the subjects which occupied them ;	4078.328387788776
and if we were beyond the hour , we could not be married all day .	3287.183769356134
My dear Madam , replied he , let us be for ever silent on this point .	3686.2503615556725
But when the gentlemen entered , Jane was no longer the first object .	3835.6916727007706
Of what are you talking ?	9056.40000276341
We have heard only once .	6481.952792877874
With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn , and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart .	3837.1798774704325
It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl , whom he was violently in love with only a few days before .	2899.0196506462303
It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her .	3001.7052017418055
Has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style ?	6659.352912756596
he merely answered her question , and read on .	5605.127211553095
If we make haste , said Lydia , as they walked along , perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes .	3811.9715102521704
Elizabeth read on ;	9670.01171633974
You will be a very happy woman .	4707.1181833302435
the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers' wives , and Elizabeth continued her walk alone , crossing field after field at a quick pace , jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity , and finding herself at last within view of the house , with weary ancles , dirty stockings , and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise .	3321.8200697367206
But as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you .	3658.578298847428
Two obstacles of the five being thus removed , Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time , without making any impression on them .	4217.59086952949
but this would be nothing if you really liked him .	3912.995623899418
yes .	23041.743585223387
and really , upon serious consideration , I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter .	3089.225794369201
and her mother was too happy , to be quite so obstinate as usual .	3275.7853518160996
though I am sure ( and I do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it , ) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole .	2976.9406840846914
and till the evening after the visit was paid , she had no knowledge of it .	2352.6673668453495
It is no such thing .	3613.3224677141184
Excellent Parsonage House !	20102.36327967146
I hope you have destroyed the letter .	3707.432472346677
She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings , and had sent for him only the Saturday before , to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening .	2714.2119255881107
I am sure there is not on his .	2805.873510254626
I am sure we never read the same , or not with the same feelings .	2788.5093166338233
Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast .	4882.742039838262
Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them .	3443.55497680387
She felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Wickham , and rejoiced in it .	2446.377279733539
Oh , no !	8214.226052075175
And taking her hand , he would have given it to Darcy , who , though extremely surprised , was not unwilling to receive it , when she instantly drew back , and said with some discomposure to Sir William , Indeed , Sir , I have not the least intention of dancing .	2574.856215016811
She certainly did not hate him .	4991.586633093775
Had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it ;	4539.090679723379
The rapture of Lydia on this occasion , her adoration of Forster , the delight of Bennet , and the mortification of Kitty , are scarcely to be described .	3262.6655943890605
I wonder my aunt did not tell us of that .	4223.484763833854
Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage , and when it drove off , Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house .	3408.4149099755105
Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , Jane and Kitty followed , but Lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could ;	3436.3532023047105
No one made any reply .	7315.50008142679
Bennet wondered at their coming , and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble , and was sure Jane would have caught cold again .	3561.359462626718
and the consciousness of this , was another reason for his resolving to follow us .	3397.549252652022
Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity ?	5945.623034092129
But with such a father and mother , and such low connections , I am afraid there is no chance of it .	2216.470965569648
she has got over the most trying age .	6581.933990150727
the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment ;	3056.985207122691
I think I have heard you say that you know them .	2743.2285958730668
but his cousin , after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Collins , sat for some time without speaking to any body .	3020.2474481701747
and on this account , as well as some others , found herself , when their visitors left them , capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction , though while it was passing , the enjoyment of it had been little .	3029.4268348909277
If Elizabeth , when Darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of its contents .	3214.352555674355
Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours , he had yielded to his brother-in-law's intreaty that he would return to his family , and leave it to him to do , whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit .	3604.7155641728195
You may , in fact , carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire , my dear cousin .	3325.135878004338
hopeless of seeing him before .	8927.00528590435
I will put on my things in a moment .	3487.1840372392157
Yours , c .	9844.561749886894
You are a good girl ;	5446.556181990591
As soon as they entered , Bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information ;	3387.365595665955
but his perfect indifference , and your pointed dislike , make it so delightfully absurd !	4241.0309623358
Will you hear it ?	9416.334592959467
Society , I own , is necessary to me .	5674.632506299349
I hope not .	4597.834061257512
Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had originated in jealousy , she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her , and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady's side , the acquaintance would now be renewed .	3191.9110822068615
Not the slightest .	13661.578587211852
This was a lucky recollection it saved her from something like regret .	5127.902227292028
but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation .	6469.205966515469
How strange must it appear to him !	6748.334143170929
She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man , who , in disposition and talents , would most suit her .	3069.4585947298096
I must beg to return to the house .	3088.1842662585495
Why , indeed , he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head , as you will hear .	3556.903696450382
On his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him , which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said , Did not you think , Darcy , that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when I was teazing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton ?	2842.1530216240985
Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter .	5704.301542638313
The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat , drink , and sleep , and pursue the usual course of their employments .	4161.371112741486
They had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister .	4056.6162623387518
She found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable .	5135.162466218455
I congratulate her .	5246.747844041123
In such cases , a woman has not often much beauty to think of .	4343.916559074611
After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity , Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday .	4045.385756042856
There , Bennet .	9071.902002960593
It appears to me so very unlikely , that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless , and who was actually staying in his colonel's family , that I am strongly inclined to hope the best .	2907.052474449396
for , besides the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her .	3871.6573790028615
Yes , replied Wickham ;	4955.443377843443
I will have no reserves from you .	3350.049396162995
And now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be ;	3884.6803020169255
My aunt , she continued , is going to-morrow into that part of the town , and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor-street .	2951.6086349148886
You give me fresh life and vigour .	7099.959681447813
I say no more than the truth , and what every body will say that knows him , replied the other .	3313.4159489199164
Her keenest attention was awakened ;	9100.166969024564
She really looked almost wild .	7915.2549892576935
Miss De Bourgh was pale and sickly ;	6732.7361136614845
Consoled by this resolution , she was the better able to bear her husband's incivility ;	5523.432053981529
There is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us .	4269.290152238251
He is his own master .	5862.840753452873
We live in so different a part of town , all our connections are so different , and , as you well know , we go out so little , that it is very improbable they should meet at all , unless he really comes to see her .	2877.5182479291566
I should like it beyond any thing !	4506.640702451638
You shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased .	4660.056558290459
Lady Catherine de Bourgh , she replied , has very lately given him a living .	3260.0417625429864
My courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me .	4753.008579882475
I wish you had been there .	3233.8314042061
But to be guarded at such a time , is very difficult .	4143.483726190153
He is perfectly amiable .	5780.905376059683
Why , he has four or five thousand a-year , and very likely more .	4189.973395602073
Have you any other objection , said Elizabeth , than your belief of my indifference ?	4176.879316963828
told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her's , and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry .	4092.147329614517
Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth ;	4988.160306516103
He was resolutely silent however ;	5762.6331949404375
How can you be smiling so , Lizzy ?	5500.98161401841
who could have done less for her ?	8320.958447122212
The person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund .	4274.071937618682
Well , Lizzy , continued her mother soon afterwards , and so the Collinses live very comfortable , do they ?	3694.200803555971
These parties were acceptable to all ;	8123.618825633553
Upon the whole , therefore , she found , what has been sometimes found before , that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire , did not in taking place , bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself .	3076.8922036950776
she made a slight , formal , apology , for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was in every respect so altered a creature , that when she went away , I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer .	2940.755748487149
Gardiner , highly amused by the kind of family prejudice , to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master , soon led again to the subject ;	3779.15913064242
If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield , said Bennet to her husband , and all the others equally well married , I shall have nothing to wish for .	2510.7557285004477
It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case .	2432.548506483837
Had he done his duty in that respect , Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle , for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her .	3659.147888823317
and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton .	3744.8025263624436
He had some intention , he added , of studying the law , and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein .	2931.185136590658
Lord !	27095.02222125315
I am not equal to it .	2055.726591396608
Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch-street , and repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and herself , which proved that the former had , from her heart , given up the acquaintance .	3820.7551707523976
His reception however was of the most flattering kind .	5423.4545906973235
Bennet's eyes sparkled .	14971.78827660551
My aunt's intelligence had given me hope , and I was determined at once to know every thing .	3455.183421606628
I cannot think of it without abhorrence .	4219.365489667387
When she was discontented she fancied herself nervous .	6422.379938531336
Yours ever , CAROLINE BINGLEY .	12607.124655900008
I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time .	3275.5516378889297
but it will have no effect on me .	3767.869434266413
and between her and Gardiner , with occasional help from Elizabeth , the conversation was carried on .	3816.3771739260774
I must go instantly to my mother ;	5362.368494591859
He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while .	5218.483501845777
I cannot pretend to be sorry , said Wickham , after a short interruption , that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts ;	2821.532063161302
A man who had felt less , might .	6059.728943777572
B Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark .	8848.355221932805
and when at last Kitty did , she very innocently said , What is the matter mamma ?	3791.4575892283224
If my vanity had taken a musical turn , you would have been invaluable , but as it is , I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers .	2961.8870603621936
She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together ;	3799.967508352251
She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity , nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct .	4154.526420489168
I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country for my part , except the shops and public places .	3795.1408941702075
but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough .	4692.820792221104
my dear , said Maria quite shocked at the mistake , it is not Lady Catherine .	3337.68142055787
When she was only fifteen , there was a gentleman at my brother Gardiner's in town , so much in love with her , that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away .	2470.2488778317033
He had to be sure done much .	4108.220200329329
Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback , and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day .	3247.2922240161743
But now suppose as much as you chuse ;	4095.4091372530106
Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Darcy's progress through his book , as in reading her own ;	4246.119548272571
for Mary , on receiving amongst the thanks of the table , the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute began another .	3376.4974881699504
The advice was followed readily , for the feverish symptoms increased , and her head ached acutely .	4015.6973040699654
Letters of business too !	14399.60922997414
he was to come there with Wickham , you know .	3900.8668730476647
Can you come to-morrow ?	11837.867148910735
And my aunt Philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good , added Kitty .	3259.2449789468674
No , Lizzy , let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame .	3188.5090857633663
I never heard of such a thing .	2609.124778269583
Are you , indeed ?	10087.377673241666
Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther , and when he ceased , the colour rose into her cheeks , and she said , In such cases as this , it is , I believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however unequally they may be returned .	2886.2676974886085
What advantage can it be to you to offend Darcy ?	5650.349227191758
and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again , which I should think exceedingly probable , stay quietly at home , and be satisfied that we shall take no offence .	2822.780219283359
Miss Bingley saw all this likewise ;	6178.086645042371
Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me , because it would be imprudent ;	4951.731516832024
said Miss Bingley ;	7385.207717151454
But his anger , I am persuaded , lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister's sentiments .	3597.82576190701
I knew enough of your disposition to be certain , that , had you been absolutely , irrevocably decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine , frankly and openly .	3131.653093050178
From such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink .	4830.500985411653
Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness .	4445.606262465625
This was exactly as it should be ;	5626.60323008997
Secondly , that I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness ;	4671.925558821295
It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he should .	3865.1364642197223
They are young in the ways of the world , and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on , as well as the plain .	2884.756163652342
With the Gardiners , they were always on the most intimate terms .	4814.37575118503
She had a sister married to a Philips , who had been a clerk to their father , and succeeded him in the business , and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade .	2876.014757087993
Never , sir .	15227.086317059124
Dear Lizzy !	19470.793106797657
How near it may be to mine , I cannot pretend to say .	4258.472220117766
for as the others were all going to sit down to cards , she could not be wanted to counteract her mother's schemes .	3258.5319056185635
Elizabeth had received none since her return , that could come from Pemberley .	3976.890370228108
Jane was as much gratified by this , as her mother could be , though in a quieter way .	3499.327573317294
The officers of the shire were in general a very creditable , gentleman-like set , and the best of them were of the present party ;	3256.5617349016916
It has been my own doing , and I ought to feel it .	2592.5941144540184
Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face , and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections .	3986.6487081964183
She explained what its effect on her had been , and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed .	4126.925283638614
CHAPTER XVIII .	12871.90986889334
No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth , and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful .	3661.729091604286
Your's , c .	7653.025158896742
You must and shall be married by a special licence .	4761.25355983997
But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them .	3199.227089662515
nor , when we attempt to describe any particular scene , will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation .	5267.280307343728
In this manner Lady Catherine talked on , till they were at the door of the carriage , when turning hastily round , she added , I take no leave of you , Miss Bennet .	2633.7755650211548
and Elizabeth , agitated and confused , rather knew that she was happy , than felt herself to be so ;	2862.1867575929464
If I had ever learnt , I should have been a great proficient .	3254.080157073137
She is quite a little creature .	5423.777072067642
Bingley does not know Wickham himself ?	6312.5300218157945
I would not trust you so near it as East Bourne for fifty pounds !	4018.055022837412
He shall not be in love with me , if I can prevent it .	2495.821642247989
I did not expect it from you .	2732.6005824663353
But in matters of greater weight , I may suffer from the want of money .	3721.050029499346
I came to you without a doubt of my reception .	4425.739702584728
Indeed I could not .	6536.062855687561
This is wholly unexpected .	7586.223022216178
and when they parted , after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield , and embracing her most tenderly , she even shook hands with the former .	3095.4446057726973
My watchfulness has been effectual ;	8895.795422355728
c .	28335.691008049325
You may readily comprehend , she added , what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and ( comparatively speaking ) a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time .	2855.525547059231
That would be the greatest misfortune of all !	6083.20291613056
And so ended his affection , said Elizabeth impatiently .	4677.638441486373
Against staying longer , however , Elizabeth was positively resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked ;	4214.673558615957
Thank you but I always mend my own .	6796.165278380684
cried Elizabeth .	6998.027216350108
But the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me .	2719.41267216397
Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt's arrival .	5991.880727815443
Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more , and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly , there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity .	3553.165749187839
and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of Lord , how tired I am !	3904.2948799136384
She does not yet leave her dressing-room .	6822.867675121152
for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming .	5098.171307576769
Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Bingley .	4406.9056582544745
but she found herself considerably useful to both of them , in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur .	3882.4688485978386
If there were any one , that one could apply to , with a probability of gaining such a clue as that , it might be of essential consequence .	3677.8260288321358
but , however , I hope it is not true .	2458.362742095409
I am sorry it went off .	3149.659173109704
Charles , when you build your house , I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley .	4582.10278986514
She had gained her point , and had time to consider of it .	2650.6388362990397
said Elizabeth , still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam .	5564.450526404868
and in his behaviour to me , there were stronger impulses even than pride .	3159.719647627423
Darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said , This walk is not wide enough for our party .	4598.053330086616
She did not choose it , said her daughter , she would go .	2990.391096743878
dear , yes ;	17917.332330032597
I declare I do not know a more aweful object than Darcy , on particular occasions , and in particular places ;	3174.9832890948965
he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton .	6053.53684155303
But why all this secrecy ?	6757.215788406046
for he would certainly think the better of me , if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat denial , and ride off as fast as I could .	3535.6738696962143
but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement .	3916.314494090075
That is all settled .	5626.759601435888
As the day of his arrival drew near , I begin to be sorry that he comes at all , said Jane to her sister .	3026.1933154365965
I wish I could see her .	2863.2424513011147
We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance .	4869.479680939975
The colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ;	3676.98765213986
But now that my dear uncle is come , I hope every thing will be well .	3595.245075586251
But , Lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or Jane at most .	3626.430827720355
You had better neglect your relations , than run the risk of offending your patroness .	4731.977608459247
His pride never deserts him ;	6465.36782743872
Yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the t te- -t te was over .	4544.551148734005
but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty .	4661.951244893472
Every park has its beauty and its prospects ;	8027.781762013357
It is , in short , impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them , without actual blame on either side .	3188.776342352729
Oh !	5043.244884590713
She then sat still five minutes longer ;	5628.504154527105
When the dancing recommenced , however , and Darcy approached to claim her hand , Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence .	2710.5202581184403
Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ;	4896.8749180696295
every sister except Mary agreed to go with her ;	6573.633880577403
You see on what a footing we are .	6029.435821469615
There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds .	4373.419097478039
and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion .	2670.7142112526694
she only smiles , I laugh .	8328.452638514338
Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman , not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Bennet .	3538.99679003801
Bennet indeed said little ;	10679.651692668003
Bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county ;	5994.467467387827
Wickham's affection for Lydia , was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it ;	4508.584121051017
Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings ;	8371.44428502081
It is really too distressing .	5269.1499412670155
Jane recollected herself soon , and putting the letter away , tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation ;	4683.8096450460835
but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures , every idea gave way to the charm of recollection ;	3609.4405114943293
How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it !	3127.091584604399
It had better have happened to you , Lizzy ;	4660.467901273649
coming frequently before breakfast , and always remaining till after supper ;	6802.872240765336
Gardiner , who was walking arm in arm with Elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of her wonder .	4069.3123258994547
Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once .	4522.310589256686
I hoped to find you reasonable ;	6527.528387964754
and I can never be in company with this Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections .	3580.5518592713497
But not long was the interval of tranquillity ;	5808.533299292637
Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him ?	6019.533544254644
and the kindness of the late Darcy , though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his own words .	3082.4150811267705
Not so hasty , if you please .	6058.934578345116
the latter of whom , however , could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her , in spite of all Miss Bingley's witticisms on fine eyes .	2475.0209140096235
They went to the library , therefore , and asked their father , whether he would not wish them to make it known to her .	2438.6403964024994
But consider your daughters .	7136.974372191538
and considering Collins's character , connections , and situation in life , I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair , as most people can boast on entering the marriage state .	3068.827391256566
Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts ?	7922.357114503524
said her aunt .	9128.9496999464
said she , I heard you before ;	4504.282552548647
You begin to comprehend me , do you ?	5248.236544239518
As to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , I am not able to judge ;	3328.278268552575
and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way .	4109.375987523929
and her mother , with manners so far from right herself , was entirely insensible of the evil .	3299.4159653356196
EDW .	40535.86118978839
and they pursued the accustomed circuit ;	5804.173999941136
that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side , and that if it were , it must belong to Darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance .	2649.923895174642
No really , replied Elizabeth ;	5812.97265502919
but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely , more I think than last year .	4805.752089987343
when I went away , I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again !	3006.6616062129888
but , though she could not look , she could listen , and he told her of feelings , which , in proving of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable .	2542.301615329046
and , after standing a few moments without saying a word , he suddenly recollected himself , and took leave .	3115.317344355677
The picture gallery , and two or three of the principal bed-rooms , were all that remained to be shewn .	3770.82748351725
I will read you the passage which particularly hurts me .	3758.94935190579
I am sorry for her , because , with her disposition , she may not get over it immediately .	2727.0502638599346
which , as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence , she accordingly read ;	4849.228274153276
that speech savours strongly of disappointment .	8723.638710366924
but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear .	4999.581104045821
Perhaps I do .	8563.939917200096
but if he wished to converse with her , he might have better success .	3813.53621437171
It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man .	3800.6872946884864
because we shall see the less of him .	5802.467466655561
No indeed ;	13358.687793517054
Royalty payments must be paid within <TIME_PERIOD > following each date on which you prepare ( or are legally required to prepare ) your periodic tax returns .	4894.820069558566
Poor little Lizzy !	13561.971351351587
Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county , she was a most active magistrate in her own parish , the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by Collins ;	3316.3134403294907
I hope , said she , as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day , you will give your mother-in-law a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her tongue ;	2149.3637059731145
We had better not mention it .	5063.621945127977
Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as Bingley had now been gone a week , and nothing was heard of his return .	3315.994930649619
he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune , or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn .	4052.900355004303
She felt anew the justice of Darcy's objections ;	5428.769996389308
and all for the sake of Collins too !	3932.144566827751
but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting .	4006.2968389713733
but , however , he did not admire her at all : indeed , nobody can , you know ;	2676.9482484745186
Much as I respect them , I believe , I thought only of you .	4174.36356934836
with barefaced questions , ingenious suppositions , and distant surmises ;	8072.588859968117
Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting , that had she chosen it , she might by this time have been presented to her , as her future niece ;	2964.9839068863157
Miss Darcy , the daughter of Darcy , of Pemberley , and Lady Anne , could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner .	2921.413917990684
She had turned away , but on hearing herself called , though in a voice which proved it to be Darcy , she moved again towards the gate .	3188.1918526426753
She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known ;	4956.715262503854
If I have , I shall be the last person to confess it .	2804.6260530789473
She was on the point of continuing her walk , when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park ;	3044.8448216046127
To the girls , who could not listen to their cousin , and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument , and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle-piece , the interval of waiting appeared very long .	3346.3581414817645
In talking over their route the evening before , Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again .	3981.108354054304
To yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you .	4268.0752773608065
It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire , nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay ;	3055.6921337409453
and she would , at times , have given any thing to be privileged to tell him , that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family .	2673.606980030982
Not one .	12265.51562029133
said Jane as she finished it .	4951.745490068883
With assumed tranquillity he then replied , I have no wish of denying that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that I rejoice in my success .	3133.3975506973984
Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring ?	6100.962917473447
But pride where there is a real superiority of mind , pride will be always under good regulation .	4419.756342791781
thoughtless , thoughtless Lydia !	14075.150505500676
I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness ;	3006.262758846239
With a triumphant smile , they were told , that it was ten miles round .	3621.788099125291
but the gentlemen will have Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton ;	4256.855704011924
You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion , which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty .	3828.2446238918856
The necessity must be obeyed and farther apology would be absurd .	5606.893613045033
One of them does .	11729.246265633985
the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy .	7420.810858970321
Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity , and by the middle of June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears ;	3323.909925928477
Now is your time .	10172.464310722573
it was impossible to think of any thing else , and totally indisposed for employment , she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise .	3256.618244421013
They were not the only objects of Collins's admiration .	4888.339063848321
but her own opinion continued the same , and she left him disappointed and sorry .	3641.0646180178496
but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal .	3651.9749533974914
With a strong prejudice against every thing he might say , she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield .	3621.402741900712
Bingley met them with hopes that Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected .	4955.417696018139
To congratulate myself on the hope of relations , whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ?	4725.3348287508525
I write rather slowly .	7634.289922812528
The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge , and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed .	3703.4001790545562
This information , however , startled Bennet ;	4879.578846452438
Care of him !	17655.059678634225
It was drawn at the same time as the other about eight years ago .	3102.4570360703256
There is , I believe , in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil , a natural defect , which not even the best education can overcome .	3629.6237096179443
If !	19150.81620399998
They have a sharp , shrewish look , which I do not like at all ;	3287.273667113362
as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general , was beyond the Collinses' reach .	5518.168698315387
My brother admires her greatly already , he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing , her relations all wish the connection as much as his own , and a sister's partiality is not misleading me , I think , when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman's heart .	2979.6429018348827
But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend ;	3148.811048264146
Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile , she said , I did not know before that you ever walked this way .	3322.345960858237
My manners must have been in fault , but not intentionally I assure you .	3051.9968956216885
I want to be told whether I ought , or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand Wickham's character .	3405.623045718982
and fearful of its being Darcy , she was directly retreating .	3505.1241574357114
Oh !	5043.244884590713
What a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt !	4140.779476336318
No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard .	5406.23812037287
Her mother's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determined not to venture near her , lest she might hear too much .	3473.83114546829
I certainly have not the talent which some people possess , said Darcy , of conversing easily with those I have never seen before .	3159.130991073267
A most welcome negative followed the last question and her alarms being now removed , she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself ;	2952.696203324332
I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship .	3292.016719490025
though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon regained her composure , and calmly replied , Why should you be surprised , my dear Eliza ?	3422.6694452717747
While she spoke , an involuntary glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes .	3196.8887557877297
Do clear them too , or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody .	4608.6810557190465
I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children .	3379.268563771282
After making every possible enquiry on that side London , Colonel F came on into Hertfordshire , anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes , and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield , but without any success , no such people had been seen to pass through .	3745.9052160714987
She was no sooner in possession of it , than hurrying into the little copse , where she was least likely to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the benches , and prepared to be happy ;	2842.245959390643
not equal to Lydia's for him .	6280.115888906952
She finds Miss Pope a treasure .	7291.133649665471
but the things should be ordered immediately .	5195.211203443342
I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn ;	3861.2669098576357
The rest of the evening brought her little amusement .	4119.924585610562
and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy .	3350.3251489830996
I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject , but I will not leave the country without confiding them , and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable .	2149.5795996873935
Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings , Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy , calling for every one's congratulations , and laughing and talking with more violence than ever ;	4806.972330171243
She was perfectly sensible that he never had ;	4060.4903621705375
till , shaking off his embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the gentlest of accents , You , who so well know my feelings towards Darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right .	3446.0539420056734
But the morrow passed off much better than she expected ;	4693.022484679858
He spoke well , but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed , and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride .	2892.467814393006
and , according to the present plan , were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire .	3200.447057312291
I believed you to be wishing , expecting my addresses .	5062.145023371947
His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen , on his returning to Netherfield .	4010.516919837566
but it must be done .	3864.782466303563
I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object .	2680.6321601366985
But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man , whom they had never seen before , of most gentleman-like appearance , walking with an officer on the other side of the way .	2837.584496810269
He is the best landlord , and the best master , said she , that ever lived .	2741.4846234659244
Though it is difficult , said Jane , to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due , the wish is certainly to his credit .	4084.579590457312
I am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose Darcy's regard .	2924.89429277251
Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door , and the carriage stopped at the small gate , which led by a short gravel walk to the house , amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party .	2734.6722995654773
We neither of us perform to strangers .	7144.730185930033
He observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ;	2386.4338259907668
The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Bennet the next morning , but the post came in without bringing a single line from him .	2840.0297614385745
Nothing that she could say , however , had any influence .	4103.859529115041
It is amazing to me , said Bingley , how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished , as they all are .	2913.0601735602813
cried he .	12788.955722278655
If he means to be but little at Netherfield , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we might possibly get a settled family there .	3030.4120785225605
Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself , but his manners were always so pleasing , that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought , his smiles and his easy address , while he claimed their relationship , would have delighted them all .	3258.575438543499
But my dear Lydia , I don't at all like your going such a way off .	4085.479351473588
E4 .	40535.86118978839
Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves .	3780.533683618862
and a fortnight only was wanting of it , when a letter arrived from Gardiner , which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent .	3713.3118896108995
and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening , and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours , Miss Elizabeth , for the two first dances especially , a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her .	2354.076454768362
And there was my aunt , all the time I was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon .	4005.354293083922
It will save me a world of trouble and economy .	5436.026566073486
And what do you think she said besides ?	4861.889139982829
Jane went to him instantly , kissed him , and thanked him for his goodness .	4635.936366910787
and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter , she found little , except the professed affection of the writer , that could give her any comfort .	2837.478107885903
She is on her road somewhere , I dare say , and so passing through Meryton , thought she might as well call on you .	2670.1587277740887
After a slight preparation for good news , the letter was read aloud .	5311.340068351251
Oh , yes .	6158.0380176604685
From the very beginning , from the first moment I may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form that ground-work of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike ;	3366.7897156949207
My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers .	4697.364389698162
Jane will be quite an old maid soon , I declare .	6232.32318171465
Nothing , on the contrary , could be more natural ;	4441.277710905567
Yes ;	10872.67006892519
Elizabeth was shocked to think that , however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself , the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal !	3761.8286171081504
It had come with a fare from London ;	5592.440114287982
Then , the two third he danced with Miss King , and the two fourth with Maria Lucas , and the two fifth with Jane again , and the two sixth with Lizzy , and the Boulanger If he had had any compassion for me , cried her husband impatiently , he would not have danced half so much !	2470.570292204853
When breakfast was over , they were joined by the sisters ;	4302.803348068238
She did indeed , Louisa .	6838.273846178764
Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London ;	4267.896464268167
No said Darcy , I have made no such pretension .	4666.678380169305
CHAPTER IV .	11147.934488852214
For , though your accusations were ill-founded , formed on mistaken premises , my behaviour to you at the time , had merited the severest reproof .	4237.410419181714
lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table , after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter ;	5041.150307181128
It was Collins's picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened ;	4640.2046599641035
But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities , replied her uncle .	4521.998310736003
Do you not consider that a connection with you , must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody ?	3759.1690789531044
My dear Bennet , cried his wife , what are you talking of ?	3099.2567916455246
Lydia was a stout , well-grown girl of fifteen , with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance ;	4893.279694545003
It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire .	3397.4589466144116
To be sure London was rather thin , but however the little Theatre was open .	5064.822867807517
She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded ;	3247.096790817975
My mother was in hysterics , and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power , I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done !	2524.2551118090537
Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room , and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from Bingley by a housemaid , and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters .	2962.21341309333
His revenge would have been complete indeed .	5327.299530642617
I could hardly keep my countenance .	5558.101106242011
Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes .	3815.413389629556
She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent , without remembering that his cousin was to go with him ;	3278.5782981490916
Elizabeth's misery increased , at such unnecessary , such officious attention !	6903.756676073732
He resigned all claim to assistance in the church , were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it , and accepted in return three thousand pounds .	3283.0872918887335
As for myself , it is many , many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner .	3135.3221319861987
That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary ;	4720.118204654308
when she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage , the difference , the change was so great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible .	3332.1778635442924
That is all settled ;	6690.662158083172
till the latter walked away from her , and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano-forte , stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's countenance .	3942.085484402947
You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters ;	3637.9604269393412
And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself ?	4742.747027843188
I do not blame Jane , she continued , for Jane would have got Bingley , if she could .	2301.1424106894274
To donate , please visit : <URL> Section 5 .	7012.2719192288905
I am astonished , my dear , said Bennet , that you should be so ready to think your own children silly .	1815.2860182367492
The effect was immediate .	8926.001600662377
Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth ;	4706.124828124932
Not that I think Charlotte so very plain but then she is our particular friend .	4270.797288631245
Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine , and his kind intention of christening , marrying , and burying his parishioners whenever it were required .	3335.4634438971248
You are quite right .	5178.841286037174
but now , as Bingley's friend and your husband , there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me .	3401.574810160725
Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ;	4507.876941589967
I wish you had been there , my dear , to have given him one of your set downs .	2564.364092884661
but you must own she is very plain .	4997.2284049667505
but attended with all that embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior , the belief of her being proud and reserved .	3835.882852239211
In revolving lady Catherine's expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference .	2713.0940010564
With a book he was regardless of time ;	6935.071416554618
Their sister's wedding day arrived ;	9712.176436690488
Wickham began to speak on more general topics , Meryton , the neighbourhood , the society , appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen , and speaking of the latter especially , with gentle but very intelligible gallantry .	3732.6642919452447
Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters .	5454.1988640500185
This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be ;	4154.996245257985
and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better .	3976.67925035348
though I doubt whether his reserve , or anybody's reserve , can be answerable for the event .	5073.050354886451
In a few days more , we may gain some news of them , and till we know that they are not married , and have no design of marrying , do not let us give the matter over as lost .	2936.5588595134345
and I wish with all my heart it may prove so ;	3356.9800548565513
The younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done ;	4562.434667489577
And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Forster , the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me .	2988.2156886521097
She answered him with cold civility .	5599.119303689319
If , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise , should come to his friend within a few days , she added , I shall know how to understand it .	2502.404027975138
But I will not repine .	4190.071917091887
Bingley will not be detained in London by them .	4724.845434873667
We were always encouraged to read , and had all the masters that were necessary .	4152.462891243452
so far we are equal .	11165.532352273824
I was angry perhaps at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper direction .	3773.5617997704258
yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet .	5632.571321409447
She burst into tears as she alluded to it , and for a few minutes could not speak another word .	3111.1181735402542

and the evening , though as it passed it seemed long , was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion ;	3168.4969879788528
for Bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken , and Lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , boisterously exclaimed , Good Lord !	3788.8599264680315
Is not it so , Bennet ?	8222.1094257265
and I never saw such happy manners !	3694.7884892899965
You will only think I feel more than I ought to do , when I tell you all .	2655.627374342128
We may as well wait , perhaps , till the circumstance occurs , before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon .	4139.742234233438
Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion ( unasked too ) on this subject ;	5368.9739781083545
Your examination of Darcy is over , I presume , said Miss Bingley ;	4012.5630346272433
He spoke of apprehension and anxiety , but his countenance expressed real security .	4673.087278118963
it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome .	6426.767173475095
You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane .	4352.401079910349
As her successor in that house , she regarded her with jealous abhorrence .	5727.3619065606
But what does he say of the living ?	5376.329899476246
E8 or 1 .	10174.83244680523
Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice , which on every other subject shall be my constant guide , though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself .	3780.649901576618
that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place , and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Morris immediately ;	3183.5940889226235
1 .	9967.378404281952
They were more disturbed , more unequal , than she had often seen them .	3304.9168068165645
and Darcy had much better finish his letter .	4191.028457489907
It is natural that obligation should be felt , and if I could feel gratitude , I would now thank you .	2821.37424712102
They are going to be encamped near Brighton ;	5512.2208040782325
If you have not been mistaken here , I must have been in an error .	3245.1361511871123
1 .	9967.378404281952
The rain continued the whole evening without intermission ;	6525.968413990355
You have employed your time much better .	4430.665738025091
She saw all the glories of the camp ;	5722.13621773446
My dear , you flatter me .	3552.0396407804474
PRIDE AND PREJUDICE : A Novel .	7229.011199289593
Nobody wants him to come .	10283.75046143618
but she had her share of business as well as her aunt , and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in Lambton , with false excuses for their sudden departure .	3250.9687829438103
The church ought to have been my profession I was brought up for the church , and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living , had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now .	2949.138681525872
Let me take it in the best light , in the light in which it may be understood .	3826.567743069647
Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet , and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body , went away .	2969.117940911008
E8 or 1 .	10174.83244680523
thought she .	19592.9184134445
and as that left too short a period for them to go so far , and see so much as they had proposed , or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on , they were obliged to give up the Lakes , and substitute a more contracted tour ;	3190.8384275415224
she cried .	9570.023979050748
Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry , but could only force one most reluctant smile .	4074.0305638210893
Yes ;	10872.67006892519
I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind .	3229.059580040176
said she .	9106.608369586867
The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence , or frightened by his high and imposing manners , and sees him only as he chuses to be seen .	3924.9497610553403
I advise Darcy , and Lizzy , and Kitty , said Bennet , to walk to Oakham Mount this morning .	2885.616825736603
and immediately , though not very fluently , gave him to understand , that her sentiments had undergone so material a change , since the period to which he alluded , as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure , his present assurances .	3099.9733707625323
To the rest of the family they paid little attention ;	3878.06692083547
That they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice !	3890.8027476698826
For my part , I am inclined to believe it all Darcy's , but you shall do as you chuse .	3485.8562211039166
She was met in the vestibule by Lydia , who , flying to her , cried in a half whisper , I am glad you are come , for there is such fun here !	2673.0571919897407
But enough of this .	6282.270155366237
Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's interruption , and promised that it should not occur again , if he would resume his book ;	3672.8324275550926
She was still very poorly , and Elizabeth would not quit her at all , till late in the evening , when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep , and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself .	2443.1708713741286
This he considered sufficient encouragement , and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her , immediately followed .	3476.276363940487
She was a little revived , however , by his bringing back his coffee cup himself ;	3008.2680618689333
Except , thought Elizabeth , when she goes to Ramsgate .	6031.6566897074
Can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand ?	5739.337241926106
Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday ;	5018.577873209894
But now she would no longer conceal from her , his share in Lydia's marriage .	4043.4359946611385
yes it would be much better to wait till Jane was well , and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again .	3710.8534074082527
It was too early in the morning for visitors , and besides , the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours .	3458.7876865348335
and however bare of news the country in general might be , they always contrived to learn some from their aunt .	4091.3757866118513
and their mother talked on , of her dislike of Darcy , and her resolution to be civil to him only as Bingley's friend , without being heard by either of them .	2609.046688364151
for on entering that place they removed into a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom .	4947.22809104182
The loo table , however , did not appear .	3912.5221337709822
which brought them again , after some time , in a descent among hanging woods , to the edge of the water , in one of its narrowest parts .	3983.9060320219905
and the other , how I am ever to pay him .	2779.305698753917
but when the servants were withdrawn , he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest , and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine , by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness .	3460.7952014504967
You know , sister , we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it .	3537.543516091713
He readily agreed to it .	4555.25866530532
I am afraid you will not be able to make it out , but I hardly know what I have written .	1885.900001228902
She will be married at sixteen !	5504.00896453962
and she was , in fact , almost engrossed by her nephews , speaking to them , especially to Darcy , much more than to any other person in the room .	2406.0781379192267
But you will know it , when I have told you what happened the very next day .	3135.449812730111
Lady Catherine , Sir William , and and Collins sat down to quadrille ;	3748.4849548300517
Another day I will do the same ;	8310.166088837688
Be assured , my dear Sir , that Collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you , and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the bitterest kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove .	3477.466752512562
It is from my cousin , Collins , who , when I am dead , may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases .	2554.961345871943
Oh !	5043.244884590713
I am by no means of opinion , I assure you , said he , that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ;	2150.331716247468
Adieu to disappointment and spleen .	13615.361597213987
Let her go then .	10205.966974507863
He concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which , in spite of all his endeavours , he had found impossible to conquer ;	3040.9586646503867
The sanguine hope of good , however , which the benevolence of her heart suggested , had not yet deserted her ;	3093.2956172266336
but unable to waste such a precious occasion , she suddenly got up , and saying to Kitty , Come here , my love , I want to speak to you , took her out of the room .	2599.8674390579918
Now and then , they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship , and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits .	3666.186135150539
I am perfectly ready , I assure you , to keep my engagement ;	2676.1801520209747
and Bingley's large fortune , the mention of which gave animation to their mother , was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign .	3952.282053216138
If , as I conclude will be the case , you send me full powers to act in your name , throughout the whole of this business , I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement .	3401.332776009805
If you mention my name at the Bell , you will be attended to .	3384.8129540596
and Collins having been in waiting near the lodges , to make them his parting obeisance , was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence , of their appearing in very good health , and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected , after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings .	3162.8631601900065
Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all , and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet , with great pleasure .	3806.417108895057
and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing her into Derbyshire , had been the means of uniting them .	3060.6595776026065
I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies ( if such young ladies there are ) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time .	2660.519055541341
Vanity and pride are different things , though the words are often used synonimously .	6549.839988330838
CHAPTER VI .	11147.934488852214
and I think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all , and very hypocritical .	2862.7870747011425
I only hope they may have half my good luck .	5042.411209610062
For though elated by his rank , it did not render him supercilious ;	5567.478397239917
You and the girls may go , or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better , for as you are as handsome as any of them , Bingley might like you the best of the party .	3200.1015178742555
Her prudent mother , occupied by the same ideas , forbore to invite him to sit by herself .	3983.912889829106
He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship , replied Elizabeth with emphasis , and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life .	2874.7399625917897
stay where you are .	11452.878008277885
Pray , my dear aunt , what is the difference in matrimonial affairs , between the mercenary and the prudent motive ?	3697.3792610416203
and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long , that even Bingley's good humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone .	3328.9823149490767
But now it comes out .	5202.9187700310495
she comes here to-morrow with him .	5357.5238258760855
Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us .	5626.211189941633
cried Elizabeth when she had finished it .	3934.7896399572523
In understanding Darcy was the superior .	8220.923899488298
Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend , that had attended her from that part of the world .	3428.0533173815916
the ladies drove on , and the others returned into the house .	3348.873803346224
My dear aunt , this is being serious indeed .	3870.3504070831486
but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him .	3525.6274090663833
Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding ;	6461.790310923325
Elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to confirm his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself ;	3551.2711953124467
When Denny , and Wickham , and Pratt , and two or three more of the men came in , they did not know him in the least .	3028.7098487310177

her features , though not plain , were insignificant ;	7252.58267936498
their father was in neither ;	12616.966195064431
But against this , there were objections ;	5930.677037834637
Darcy was almost as far from her , as the table could divide them .	3437.11905078592
But she is very young ;	5721.002196373742
but was too angry with Lydia , to send any message to her .	3708.884111367191
but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody ;	3667.5036872953256
Bingley was by no means deficient , but Darcy was clever .	4134.933615384414
The introduction , however , was immediately made ;	4329.151141798277
You must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention ;	3927.893242141684
Nothing could console and nothing appease her .	5873.687986291181
Bingley .	14098.684472397483
At present I will say nothing about it .	3640.609581773522
but what could set you off in the first place ?	5230.599532215293
but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane ;	3164.3874860453734
The loss of her daughter made Bennet very dull for several days .	5085.961095078531
and , while examining the nearer aspect of the house , all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned .	3242.9107282974946
several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle , a private had been flogged , and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married .	3899.782464225678
and to her it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first , and was in a way to be very much in love ;	2691.007350628847
There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name .	4037.547600895049
In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ;	3667.652897234003
she cried : This is delightful indeed !	6679.755149754572
In town I believe he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence , and being now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and dissipation .	4104.910522994813
said she , as she looked in her face .	4018.9990838137364
This fine account of him , whispered her aunt , as they walked , is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend .	3121.525773150107
Young women should always be properly guarded and attended , according to their situation in life .	4793.541607028553
not deficient in good humour when they were pleased , nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it ;	4188.760339104878
Complied with !	25166.476854978322
Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey , and as she did not answer them all herself , attention was necessary , which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her ;	3082.1476225185133
but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters .	4720.796148630381
are quite well .	11985.6439098053
Oh !	5043.244884590713
I grieve to find , however , that Colonel F is not disposed to depend upon their marriage ;	3437.9526615151863
and if I had my will , we should .	3681.7161416181725
Why will you think so ?	8203.406352555941
and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on the renewal of his addresses .	2883.4357368493384
I might as well enquire , replied she , why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ?	3689.153102262354
I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here .	3615.4485700415917
who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister , and gratified my vanity , in useless or blameable distrust .	5114.564838629795
Jane heard them with horror .	9851.805781263376
My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family , and if my manner has been at all reprehensible , I here beg leave to apologise .	3463.950392925963
She enquired into Charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly and minutely , and gave her a great deal of advice , as to the management of them all ;	2748.059818710743
I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party .	3120.3251514694107
Attention , forbearance , patience with Darcy , was injury to Wickham .	5967.2225630555495
and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must produce , found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business .	3741.260533374604
so genteel and so easy !	11163.752304986556
Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to the piano-forte , and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way , which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived , she seated herself .	3442.352438212545
Oh !	5043.244884590713
Though Lydia's short letter to F gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green , something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W never intended to go there , or to marry Lydia at all , which was repeated to Colonel F who instantly taking the alarm , set off from B intending to trace their route .	3548.1767050640433
She stared , coloured , doubted , and was silent .	3899.8846899265905
and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person ( Lady Lucas ) freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Bingley .	3173.1279168146643
I , who have valued myself on my abilities !	4950.409829355164
I wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind .	3604.755246800108
He was seriously concerned , that a cause of so little advantage to any one , should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law , and he was determined , if possible , to find out the extent of his assistance , and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could .	2581.373343493024
She will make him a very proper wife .	4904.683862284787
But depend upon it , Collins , she added , that Lizzy shall be brought to reason .	2805.3883295605406
He comes down on Thursday at the latest , very likely on Wednesday .	5345.196077664402
Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is .	5136.027393661146
What do you think has happened this morning ?	4914.757565641345
She was gone directly .	5425.653481832679
Elizabeth was forced to go .	3442.683086502039
and when your sister is recovered , you shall if you please name the very day of the ball .	3186.2689491635465
and Darcy , after looking at her for a moment , turned silently away .	3256.189578162936
He was full of joy and attention .	4602.911769686079
He looked serious as usual ;	7138.216190359547
nay , which has already arisen from it , I am sure you would judge differently in the affair .	3619.032364925692
Lydia laughed , and said , Aye , that is just like your formality and discretion .	4660.595601138235
Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister ;	4902.012320003066
In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man !	5004.9111201016785
When all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at Pemberley ;	4403.581578138961
Yes ;	10872.67006892519
As soon as Jane had read Gardiner's hope of Lydia's being soon married , her joy burst forth , and every following sentence added to its exuberance .	4040.5685317225743
Jane's temper was not desponding , and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart .	3311.647982913394
We may as well leave them by themselves you know ;	4709.002005419985
Elizabeth replied that it was .	4354.7497526348025
The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning ;	4841.495149050313
any thing was a welcome relief to him at Rosings ;	7687.414976918538
Much more rational , my dear Caroline , I dare say , but it would not be near so much like a ball .	2826.7218292123243
What do you mean ?	5022.282017328646
However , I did not hear above one word in ten , for I was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear Wickham .	3297.5229358721476
A carat character is used to denote superscription .	7409.515773258916
He has not an ill-natured look .	6178.378157249037
What could your ladyship propose by it ?	5500.003080571057
In Three Volumes .	7986.324365441749
with tears and lamentations of regret , invectives against the villanous conduct of Wickham , and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage ;	4522.321082468944
They insist also on my seeing Jones therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me and excepting a sore-throat and head-ache there is not much the matter with me .	3549.7870574857675
But such as they were , it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them , and what a contrariety of emotion they excited .	3460.508616861871
Jane had not been gone long before it rained hard .	5270.019472708432
but I am sure I never saw any thing of it .	1448.5782307890804
Reynolds's respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master .	6417.536632222291
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ?	5733.378801314554
They saw much to interest , but nothing to justify enquiry .	5318.270786212949
cried Miss Bingley .	7012.77542559694
but she did weep from vexation and envy .	5106.487653400729
Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight .	6810.982956595229

Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister .	4866.153965493816
and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle , so I was determined he should know it , and so I let down the side glass next to him , and took off my glove , and let my hand just rest upon the window frame , so that he might see the ring , and then I bowed and smiled like any thing .	2898.8472352473273
I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression .	2991.4813309241376
Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish , self reproach , she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness .	5045.180274669906
but as he took up his abode with the Lucases , his arrival was no great inconvenience to Bennet .	3747.680528753404
Lady Catherine then observed , Your father's estate is entailed on Collins , I think .	4122.383435746978
Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort ;	3892.724081929339
Collins has made an offer to Lizzy , and she will not have him .	3132.295801788042
I think there cannot be too little said on the subject .	2969.1572936219072
and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Darcy's looks and behaviour .	2650.622785729874
and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her .	2671.266499107678
I thank you for explaining it so fully .	4969.520979669073
She cared for none of her friends , she wanted no help of his , she would not hear of leaving Wickham .	3231.6964313152016
Thank Heaven !	15898.977279388886
YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION , THE TRADEMARK OWNER , AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL , DIRECT , INDIRECT , CONSEQUENTIAL , PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE .	4343.258796994072
but he will vouch for the good conduct , the probity and honour of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that Wickham has deserved much less attention from Darcy than he has received ;	3436.5843804556607

That is not very likely ;	6895.881740260271
At present I will not say more , but perhaps when we are better acquainted He was interrupted by a summons to dinner ;	3892.157393230082
But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill .	3559.3595805721575
one , that Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief ;	5422.359414028747
Elizabeth , after slightly surveying it , went to a window to enjoy its prospect .	4476.780614425816
What can be the meaning of this !	5307.449473298134
What is Darcy to me , pray , that I should be afraid of him ?	2946.144761305342
I assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town .	2954.828934096882
Obstinate , headstrong girl !	14399.350748606781
for certainly , there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction .	5216.886660001843
It now first struck her , that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage , and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings , in the absence of more eligible visitors .	2897.145644883732
Certainly not ;	17010.52556126975
You could not make me happy , and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who would make you so .	2316.590802016076
Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice .	6776.16138763544
The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information , was as sincere as her brother's in sending it .	3963.4463402559422
I thank you for my share of the favour , said Elizabeth ;	3098.0513620828847
I have nothing either to hope or fear , and nothing to reproach him with .	3456.9965964216026
At present I am not in love with Wickham ;	3447.179403443252
It is only that he has better means of having it than many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor .	3171.4441319281414
and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked Darcy before they had known any thing of the matter .	2973.2941982584252
but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them .	3024.116892813828
I have by no means done .	3280.1277443976514
That is not an unnatural surmise , said Fitzwilliam , but it is lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly .	3375.545093579767
all that his library afforded .	13027.816527050922
The commendation bestowed on him by Reynolds was of no trifling nature .	5436.202127672244
You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them .	2436.6951041333446
But let me advise you to think better of it .	3275.188958169881
You excel so much in the dance , Miss Eliza , that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you ;	2989.663758515243
MY DEAR BROTHER , At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece , and such as , upon the whole , I hope will give you satisfaction .	3978.8211681570447
Thank you , said Lydia , for if you did , I should certainly tell you all , and then Wickham would be angry .	3293.9547243059114
In Three Volumes .	7986.324365441749
I know no harm of her .	3182.6260151624074
Then , who taught you ?	8136.60517103989
I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary .	3453.5310822361344
and though he belonged to one of the universities , he had merely kept the necessary terms , without forming at it any useful acquaintance .	3007.865818515033
He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily postponed seeing him , till after the departure of the former .	3301.7371567077766
Such a charming man !	9358.91521868476
His pride , said Miss Lucas , does not offend me so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it .	2963.762706362092
thought Elizabeth .	16422.34008653592
In a few minutes , Bennet half opened the door and called out , Lizzy , my dear , I want to speak with you .	2130.1269842614097
But Lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me .	3166.614711377655
You may depend upon my seeking no further .	4939.736350846946
but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Philips , and was , by her watchfulness , most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin .	3636.4065564492093
As yet , she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its reasonableness .	4462.992404832412
I should as soon call her mother a wit .	4947.843580422741
We will be down as soon as we can , said Jane ;	3794.0422520443244
This must be the grossest falsehood !	7158.578038103882
Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before , how many years longer Bennet was likely to live ;	4446.299293785231
Collins then returned to Elizabeth .	6698.085489547653
Yes ;	10872.67006892519
Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene , and could observe the three ladies before her composedly .	4433.34599982728
and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Collins , was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house , as soon as Bennet were dead .	2369.9968384318618
And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother ?	5678.263636940438
Miss Eliza Bennet , said Miss Bingley , despises cards .	3730.3028612196067
that as to fortune , it is a most eligible match ;	4122.465202578527
and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister's , Wickham is by no means a respectable young man .	2253.7348162362123
Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour , till Sir William thus began .	3248.9492932466324
What could be more natural than his asking you again ?	5092.495214557017
Certain it is , that the living became vacant two years ago , exactly as I was of an age to hold it , and that it was given to another man ;	3208.512519126763
I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh , and of her mother Lady Catherine .	3054.6167920163975
Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition .	6290.678917700585
I shall send this by express , that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer .	3494.117212148383
He is certainly a good brother , said Elizabeth , as she walked towards one of the windows .	2517.0606323906673
If you'll believe me , I did not once put my foot out of doors , though I was there a fortnight .	3320.765853166504
And it is the more to be lamented , because there is reason to suppose , as my dear Charlotte informs me , that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter , has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence , though , at the same time , for the consolation of yourself and Bennet , I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an enormity , at so early an age .	2634.4388509853147
and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn , and of her stay in Derbyshire , so often , and in so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts .	2839.8972291907844
but at the same time , there was no one , whose knowledge of a sister's frailty would have mortified her so much .	2806.8934543886467
My father and mother believe the worst , but I cannot think so ill of him .	2457.9646954535483
Wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we have thought him ;	4284.592228951593
Ten thousand pounds !	15568.999626138326
I do assure you , Sir , that I have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man .	2393.997841646107
But as to your other objection , I am afraid it will hardly hold good .	3235.688757077724
Yet now I must believe you , cried Jane .	6286.275714652222
and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself .	3182.3400421356537
She has no money , no connections , nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for ever .	3539.7077257455257
In seeing Bingley , her thoughts naturally flew to her sister ;	4606.166872563189
Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match ;	6944.846679058684
A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood , since you went away .	3371.7332937035007
I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude ;	4250.14179045263
and though Philips , as well as her sister , stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good humour encouraged , yet , whenever she did speak , she must be vulgar .	2813.8390682398585
Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family , they did not attempt to oppose it , for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants , while they waited at table , and judged it better that one only of the household , and the one whom they could most trust , should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject .	2799.936006713721
It was only said , 'Lately , George Wickham , Esq .	4434.964032112642
It will be her turn soon to be teazed , said Miss Lucas .	3746.6139525634635
Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one ;	8342.35863566679
We accordingly went and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend , the certain evils of such a choice .	4036.3393003858478
Indeed he has no improper pride .	8406.794056182129
and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane , and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do .	2375.0247213205034
There is something a little stately in him to be sure , replied her aunt , but it is confined to his air , and is not unbecoming .	2907.3343240113886
By Elizabeth's instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband , which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself .	3723.907729550717
From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent .	8720.234844529981
I shall not say that you are mistaken , he replied , because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ;	2703.422623226744
Blame you !	20594.378195456764
She will be married !	5232.015185660201
Is he married or single ?	10808.931716168203
but she sat down , resolving within herself , to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man .	3633.7271874471235
And with regard to the resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the former were excited by his marrying me , it would not give me one moment's concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn .	2846.5889197700794
She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject , and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect .	2787.3265469566095
The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister , will prove what she felt .	3504.0306399423257
I am the less surprised at what has happened , replied Sir William , from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire .	3281.5056739578595
If you are redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase Project Gutenberg associated with or appearing on the work , you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1 .	3227.9750142576804
I did not think Caroline in spirits , were her words , but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London .	2645.925198870358
That reply will do for the present .	5852.427346505184
But , unluckily for her ladyship , its effect had been exactly contrariwise .	4450.390617580033
Their parties abroad were less varied than before ;	6798.090728121611
The indirect boast ;	9636.579600023122
Till I was in Kent , and saw so much both of Darcy and his relation , Colonel Fitzwilliam , I was ignorant of the truth myself .	3535.738244015443
cried Elizabeth .	6998.027216350108
YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE , STRICT LIABILITY , BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1 .	4575.940275559065
But she had no reason to fear and Gardiner's curiosity ;	3655.7639431198995
Collins , however , was not discouraged from speaking again , and Darcy's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech , and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way .	2709.504046319984
but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley's inattention .	3925.985524091138
Presuming , however , that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment , than any dislike of the proposal , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of society , a perfect willingness to accept it , she ventured to engage for her attendance , and the day after the next was fixed on .	2954.551938703693
Indeed , Eliza , you will be as welcome to me as either of them .	3020.535533320114
for on the very morning after their own arrival at Lambton , these visitors came .	4695.885596524526
This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ;	4123.215806177185
safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune .	8443.831309963462
What is your own opinion ?	8225.95202889139
and Bennet , who could by no means wish for so speedy a return , immediately said , But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here , my good sir ?	3136.4766741252292
He meant to provide for me amply , and thought he had done it ;	3689.8907626215464
To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew ;	4963.330588347029
If I were not afraid of judging harshly , I should be almost tempted to say , that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this .	2677.8337146003373
And , my dear Jane , I never saw you look in greater beauty .	3008.6425361787187
His misfortunes !	15056.95571525284
The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt .	4272.157458557272
and had this led to no suspicion , the faces of both as they hastily turned round , and moved away from each other , would have told it all .	3125.263601855777
6 .	40535.86118978839
How much I shall have to tell !	6045.409492291751
and whatever he did , done gracefully .	5633.4012273774715
It was a large , well-proportioned room , handsomely fitted up .	3513.5191857949467
She sat intently at work , striving to be composed , and without daring to lift up her eyes , till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister , as the servant was approaching the door .	3174.549706119508
They entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds ;	4521.124513341943
but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome .	4653.360550395036
A place too , with which so many of your acquaintance are connected .	5348.724294764573
and in spite of every thing , was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune .	2485.3726914265535
Take care , Lizzy ;	13876.153177072114
And this , said she , is the end of all his friend's anxious circumspection !	3160.1802930445083
for that will have more weight in the argument , Miss Bennet , than you may be aware of .	3662.274576472598
assuring him that Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ;	4977.2967559841
when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet , she turned suddenly towards him and said , By the bye , Charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield ?	3602.2684290060133
She looked at Jane , to see how she bore it ;	3069.0924860523264
I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which I am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before .	2636.070933110452
If one could but go to Brighton !	5324.706414623396
and Elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject .	2714.7795837338044
She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley .	4960.7411239038465
the gentlemen being out , they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere .	5234.102843200167
Gardiner , to whom the chief of this news had been given before , in the course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with her , made her sister a slight answer , and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation .	2748.1828987169897
Let me write for you , said Jane , if you dislike the trouble yourself .	3351.339363256405
The happiness which this reply produced , was such as he had probably never felt before ;	3912.9804375256786
And , above all things , keep Bennet from fighting .	5833.413690554556
Oh !	5043.244884590713
I never heard any harm of her ;	3421.087557480255
By supposing such an affection , you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong , and me most unhappy .	5129.556688978182
I can recal nothing worse .	5737.584198711249
Their lodgings were not long a secret , and at length they began to know the officers themselves .	4071.5914960520895
I like her appearance , said Elizabeth , struck with other ideas .	3709.6364545793144
We had better go into the avenue .	6640.329511830289
I am prodigiously proud of him .	2481.839212970895
and it was not wholly without foundation .	3314.878816990461
Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune , which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day .	3447.656191440431
Those who chose to be idle , certainly might .	7166.818457532518
You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble ;	4614.042222521722
To Jane herself , she exclaimed , there could be no possibility of objection .	4689.502100467415
It was all conjecture .	5017.627240497225
Elizabeth merely curtseyed to him , without saying a word .	3931.52457631456
You taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous .	5153.823250759097
but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected .	4406.932172985458
and nothing therefore remained to be done , but to think well of them both , to defend the conduct of each , and throw into the account of accident or mistake , whatever could not be otherwise explained .	3220.6877313271466
What is there of good to be expected ?	6228.507281022009
It is what every body says .	4663.563647788111
Every body is disgusted with his pride .	7172.454476658496
said her sister .	6970.730437567455
and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield , I should probably be off in five minutes .	3857.805570037599
adding , that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it .	2618.8750442329583
When I am in company with him , I will not be wishing .	2797.7813462144336
His surprise was great .	8539.4085860394
and they have another , who lives somewhere near Cheapside .	4878.88190736584
At length , however , his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family .	2853.920155663561
Of a fine , stout , healthy love it may .	6872.587798541704
She remembered also , that till the Netherfield family had quitted the country , he had told his story to no one but herself ;	3654.491989982404
I am not ashamed of having been mistaken or , at least , it is slight , it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters .	2309.8019107394466
She shall hear my opinion .	6403.698452060093
It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ;	4262.798980477761
I am far from attributing any part of Bingley's conduct to design , said Elizabeth ;	2743.811413226676
The second began .	8958.579259043401
This is a wretched beginning indeed !	5891.722768509398
a favourite with her mother , whose affection had brought her into public at an early age .	4649.847936003993
I am so happy .	3455.6351408491505
He stood by her , however , for some minutes , in silence ;	3515.589048288011
She will be taken good care of .	4691.60499925647
I should like to know how he behaves among strangers .	3801.3269253319827
Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Wickham .	5137.6597989156535
Yes certainly .	15870.91529789663
Your's , c .	7653.025158896742
Poor dear child !	16217.853913953348
Your sister I also watched .	9475.389905594173
The sisters , on hearing this , repeated three or four times how much they were grieved , how shocking it was to have a bad cold , and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves ;	3632.10099559554
For the last week they had seen very little of either Lady Catherine or her daughter .	4708.286531141368
If that had been nearer , she would not have gone so soon .	3586.8091913194694
It is nearly fifty miles .	5268.981828770545
Seriously , however , she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's concurrence .	4278.804183046567
Very , very much .	8869.892610360228
Charlotte did not stay much longer , and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard .	3662.7889512663664
for as to Darcy's using him ill , it is perfectly false ;	4878.759827304875
Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit , but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it .	3042.7550464283518
A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant ;	4004.5751481471293
and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects .	3704.61448420606
Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think , without feeling that she had been blind , partial , prejudiced , absurd .	4042.2463779945147
She was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when .	3005.344630837604
Her affections had been continually fluctuating , but never without an object .	5323.561913646881
You are joking , Lizzy .	4659.740579628181
You dislike an argument , and want to silence this .	5118.426753798668
Darcy , who was leaning against the mantle-piece with his eyes fixed on her face , seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise .	3487.0775360059156
My dear Madam , he replied , this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what I have been hoping to receive ;	2851.395307653005
Ring the bell , Kitty , for Hill .	8398.993006688012
He was always to have gone on Saturday , and to Saturday he still meant to stay .	3596.142369508658
Believe me , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that your modesty , so far from doing you any disservice , rather adds to your other perfections .	3405.5125983899907
The gentlemen arrived early ;	8185.326467736363
How is such a man to be worked on ?	5015.514617261417
Merely to the illustration of your character , said she , endeavouring to shake off her gravity .	4484.806680152886
and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned , and preparing her to be surprised , she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Darcy and herself .	2687.632462859205
but I am afraid of alarming you be assured that we are all well .	2936.204451832835
I am , said he , with a firm voice .	2312.9342420047374
Let her be called down .	9283.747072430904
It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first .	3419.665299778897
Removed !	40535.86118978839
In the first place , she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter ;	3522.0901732346424
My dear , dear Lydia !	4219.091829897515
Impossible .	37379.511870440976
Reynolds could interest her on no other point .	7994.115297025285
Is this , thought Elizabeth , meant for me ?	5877.567358985055
and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves , and meanly of others .	3696.8381438704696
and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration of her , of her former favourite George Wickham ;	2379.455592714394
He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate , generous heart in the world ;	3371.696106172734
and after observing that he was a very gentleman-like man , asked her how she had liked him .	2728.10385211358
To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either .	5298.1067089738835
Do you play and sing , Miss Bennet ?	4547.705420706133
No principle of either , would be violated by my marriage with Darcy .	4466.152782870626
You will be censured , slighted , and despised , by every one connected with him .	3269.940305494613
Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural ;	4867.687737264247
Aye , so it is , cried her mother , and Long does not come back till the day before ;	3199.398772882854
With all my heart ;	7922.277267744764
on his side even more .	9028.884295137266
Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality , especially on Lydia's side , but nothing to give him any alarm .	4018.519595197427
His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage , for Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane , in order to have the earliest assurance of it ;	3340.4376717866885
But she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow .	3995.810345490738
my last letter had never reached her .	6339.283585361865
I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford .	3437.0733183997972
Oh , my dear Lizzy !	3975.27699273275
He was well , but so much engaged with Darcy , that they scarcely ever saw him .	2888.449146959857
but , instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to Miss Bennet , I beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so I took the liberty of coming to ask .	2496.440763365842
but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic .	3991.197036413902
for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement , they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning , from all those who were not immediately on the spot .	4134.484246867804
After pausing on this point a considerable while , she once more continued to read .	5351.696414578732
and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her .	3027.438895542785
Her own thoughts were employing her .	5643.965270533218
1 .	9967.378404281952
and his attachment to Wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me , to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow , and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant .	2935.117411084272
Mary would not understand them ;	8519.014351202315
The situation of your mother's family , though objectionable , was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently , so almost uniformly betrayed by herself , by your three younger sisters , and occasionally even by your father .	3319.1565418585237
The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Bennet's visit , and determining when they should ask him to dinner .	3065.001099437012
The country is a vast deal pleasanter , is not it , Bingley ?	4632.710283400446
I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man , without having a wish beyond it .	2730.556595867413
and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct , who will believe me ?	2792.5017272580767
Smiles decked the face of Bennet , as the carriage drove up to the door ;	4142.534305969877
When convinced on that article , Miss Bennet had nothing farther to wish .	4887.10111038208
and Bennet , in the meanwhile , was giving way to all the happy schemes , which the good humour , and common politeness of Bingley , in half an hour's visit , had revived .	2986.7871527212133
But her conclusion was false ;	6974.029971814536
yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Gardiner thought of him , and Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's beginning the subject .	3271.624490916696
No , she would go home .	4563.51038632833
No , never .	8762.80048470871
He is a pleasant fellow , and would jilt you creditably .	4104.489441476711
Jane had been a week in town , without either seeing or hearing from Caroline .	4518.175654642191
for though feeling almost secure , and with reason , for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging , he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday .	3879.7948329614887
Well , then supposing them to be in London .	3502.7304532660996
Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related .	7915.932922524722
The apothecary came , and having examined his patient , said , as might be supposed , that she had caught a violent cold , and that they must endeavour to get the better of it ;	2591.349058634238
Teazing , teazing , man !	12297.997754828939
and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Wickham's attentions .	3585.666473093276
I was right , therefore ;	5342.300832004972
I pity you , Miss Eliza , for this discovery of your favourite's guilt ;	4028.7187117302324
and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see .	3755.3693443535903
They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday ;	6225.297969178337
It was exactly a scene , and exactly among people , where he had apparently least to do , and least temptation to go .	3220.196570768479
The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade , and within view of his own warehouses , could have been so well bred and agreeable .	3399.2335888358116
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule .	4402.322334100593
My mind however is now made up on the subject , for having received ordination at Easter , I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh , widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh , whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish , where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship , and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church of England .	2954.1655563648746
No ;	16502.532430239946
I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude .	3380.1132819717586
The general prejudice against Darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton , to attempt to place him in an amiable light .	3153.234198368594
and as for Purvis Lodge , the attics are dreadful .	4140.309799830853
When Bennet was told of this , she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected , considering what her anxiety for his life had been before .	3510.4663429059606
He spoke of it as a certain event , of which the time alone could be undecided .	4091.8052835013564
Elizabeth soon observed , and instantly understood it .	4349.895996866951
But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness , is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging .	3863.337458114447
You are too hasty , Sir , she cried .	3417.498168545221
What do you keep winking at me for ?	5508.537765534108
On the very last day of the regiment's remaining in Meryton , he dined with others of the officers at Longbourn ;	3580.330669128307
Wickham of course wanted more than he could get ;	6662.40243120294
Elizabeth was glad of it ;	3566.155396388719
she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes ;	6793.838890093139
but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry .	5579.227837207879
However little Darcy might have liked such an address , he contented himself with coolly replying , that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned , no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer .	3815.35931273441
and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too !	4168.666052048086
but the ladies were ready enough to talk , and Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement , nor inclined to be silent himself .	3517.244435327017
said Jane .	10530.671620167666
You are very cautious , I suppose , as to its being created .	2986.7451189609274
The feelings of the person who wrote , and the person who received it , are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circumstance attending it , ought to be forgotten .	3183.255114224091
My dearest Lizzy will , I am sure , be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment , at my expence , when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me .	2626.354436066202
though we can never be what we once were to each other .	4419.911135845129
in looking back to what they had feared , only two hours ago , she felt all the advantages of what they had gained .	4138.931969066862
Console Lady Catherine as well as you can .	6748.3753824660525
Lizzy , said her father , I have given him my consent .	3193.7496648404103
But good lord !	9012.30266206147
Hate you !	20594.378195456764
I pity , though I cannot help blaming her .	3662.121705711358
He left Netherfield for London , on the day following , as you , I am certain , remember , with the design of soon returning .	2883.5022312262304
His sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own ;	5946.683372100811
Darcy was fixed in astonishment .	7181.265752631828
But slyness seems the fashion .	7295.290247434126
Are you quite sure , Ma'am ?	7211.8500283557405
As I did the other day , said Elizabeth , with a conscious smile ;	3195.7861050844167
And is such a girl to be my nephew's sister ?	4806.174777714398
His anxiety for Jane was evident , and his attentions to herself most pleasing , and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others .	3540.0616761360657
What I have to say relates to poor Lydia .	5513.197315050991
and though her resolution was not to be shaken , her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation .	3283.4215840900756
Pray go to see them , with Sir William and Maria .	5880.57424577864
The only pain was in leaving her father , who would certainly miss her , and who , when it came to the point , so little liked her going , that he told her to write to him , and almost promised to answer her letter .	2656.6894933505782
My dear Bennet , replied his wife , how can you be so tiresome !	3140.5994718815155
Affectation of candour is common enough ;	10342.709094201176
of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt .	6186.0999377954
He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him , to lay his private actions open to the world .	3390.043781532788
The whole party have left Netherfield by this time , and are on their way to town ;	3640.6990408029587
I know it to be impossible .	3052.449590286968
I have written to Colonel Forster , to inform him of our present arrangements , and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Wickham in and near Brighton , with assurances of speedy payment , for which I have pledged myself .	3057.8593462032522
What , has she frightened away some of your lovers ?	6232.681580584299
You have no compassion on my poor nerves .	4512.403046002369
She wanted to hear of him , when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence .	3838.5276647527817
Are not you curious to hear how it was managed ?	6980.197694617317
Poor Wickham ;	15551.652787780633
for she had a lively , playful disposition , which delighted in any thing ridiculous .	4605.1414671497605
What do you think ?	6461.108738063677
Her many attractions were again dwelt on , and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy , and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter .	3874.1612563562962
She had instinctively turned away ;	4924.840189806005
Kitty , run down and order the carriage .	6820.437616862788
When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose , the tables were broke up , the carriage was offered to Collins , gratefully accepted , and immediately ordered .	3554.986384916379
I cannot blame myself for having done thus much .	4092.411801905585
Their situation was awkward enough ;	8709.7858790042
When you have killed all your own birds , Bingley , said her mother , I beg you will come here , and shoot as many as you please , on Bennet's manor .	3254.795395969797
and her expectations of advantage to her family , when in a happy humour , were so far beyond reason , that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day , to make his proposals .	2841.2768061102634
Do not involve yourself , or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent .	4222.814161993799
There is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping , I dare say .	3206.8788091551023
your name will never even be mentioned by any of us .	5694.544635531328
but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame .	6169.7453527911
Copyright laws in most countries are in a constant state of change .	7506.021397262694
Can it be possible that he will marry her ?	6577.622755806268
Oh , no .	7440.124161104014
Bennet replied that he had not .	4117.31796434229
But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister , or say half that remained to be said , for the present .	2622.170733912963
My dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts .	3457.041931529491
All that is known after this is , that they were seen to continue the London road .	4045.4376314063984
Good gracious !	13026.898755758692
You must learn some of my philosophy .	5583.490600470847
But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife , as I certainly did .	2950.8395129362316
Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family ;	5007.217331821577
How shall we punish him for such a speech ?	6015.607383172514
and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house , walked quietly into it herself .	3314.3917374678394
But wishes were vain ;	8002.065412950711
Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety ;	6537.629324882411
It ought to be good , he replied , it has been the work of many generations .	3338.1337885606094
Lydia left a few lines for his wife , informing her of their intention .	5301.602552002272
His understanding and temper , though unlike her own , would have answered all her wishes .	4117.477245170652
But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about .	3564.975016847583
Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman , who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable .	3442.9017354708817
He never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much ;	3942.2831146887593
blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing .	5465.658746409156
She looked at her father to entreat his interference , lest Mary should be singing all night .	3771.110880380119
From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents .	4482.684945057537
1 .	9967.378404281952
But however insincere you may choose to be , you shall not find me so .	4037.4492874476136
I knew how it would be .	3119.873446679028
Why , my dear , you must know , Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England ;	2666.6817052613264
Perfectly so I thank you .	8119.658361053955
and the girls had the pleasure of hearing , as they entered the drawing-room , that Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation , and was then in the house .	2168.0124939953603
repeated Darcy contemptuously ;	18207.933137485194
and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling , was more openly acknowledged , for she did not scruple to call out , What is that you are saying , Fitzwilliam ?	3281.214855293863
Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined .	5947.106652692004
but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ;	4435.127127948276
Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Collins and myself on this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of another : of which we have been advertised by the same authority .	3723.6188746043717
and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love , and the object of that love , her friend Eliza , she sat herself seriously to work to find it out .	2577.4483679005334
Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life ;	5162.4473219865495
This is not quite enough to make her understand his character .	3442.576178471451
in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise , and where he was reduced to meet , frequently meet , reason with , persuade , and finally bribe , the man whom he always most wished to avoid , and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce .	3758.2248072258676
You may ask questions , which I shall not choose to answer .	3280.1004762549887
It is very unlucky ;	5277.121553209747
From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Darcy had been over-rated , Elizabeth had never yet answered Gardiner's long letter , but now , having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome , she was almost ashamed to find , that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as follows : I would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as I ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory , detail of particulars ;	2832.071323459082
Your's , c .	7653.025158896742
I see your design , Bingley , said his friend .	3083.0647996073026
He will be forgot , and we shall all be as we were before .	4178.862457665402
E1 through 1 .	9602.607658871702
My dear , dear aunt , she rapturously cried , what delight !	3822.6299122358723
And gravely glancing at Darcy , There is a fine old saying , which every body here is of course familiar with 'Keep your breath to cool your porridge , ' and I shall keep mine to swell my song .	3874.492874542525
The Lucases are very artful people indeed , sister .	5049.334529345699
Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement , but was too much oppressed to make any reply .	3647.146012364611
You need not .	6216.43829043706
You have a sweet room here , Bingley , and a charming prospect over that gravel walk .	3285.641661494275
My fingers , said Elizabeth , do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women's do .	3317.458404478734
But it was her business to be satisfied and certainly her temper to be happy ;	3732.4438292340565
Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there ( an invitation moreover including the whole party ) so immediately after your arrival !	4221.259576713574
At last she recollected that she had been travelling , and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance .	3807.784960499538
Her aunt asked her , smilingly , how she liked it .	4287.117756030413
it was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small fortune , and however uncertain of giving happiness , must be their pleasantest preservative from want .	3932.8865851887904
and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her , she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both , and could very sincerely wish him happy .	3186.2247368085777
At present I have not room to do them justice .	4596.60901659076
She studied every sentence : and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different .	4677.273940228372
I will think no more about him .	3397.5575978260895
II .	33751.16882669166
The evening passed quietly , unmarked by any thing extraordinary .	5429.47378399674
She found that she was to receive no other answer and , after a short pause , added , I think I have understood that Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again ?	2683.5380988199595
She tried to recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence , that might rescue him from the attacks of Darcy ;	4053.938540696939
I comfort myself with thinking , replied Jane , that he certainly would not marry Lydia , if he had not a real regard for her .	2357.5938187591173
When the gentlemen had joined them , and tea was over , the card tables were placed .	3901.4006282248492
The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541 .	5792.1553507178105
They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world .	3192.196065889483
They agreed that Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct ;	3736.733458555711
Is that his design in settling here ?	8263.0433823803
My dear Jane !	6139.014673824843
I assure you , I feel it exceedingly , said Lady Catherine ;	2736.5798243945724
I am quite well .	2767.558334288896
VOL .	25580.072097342923
I must think your language too strong in speaking of both , replied Jane , and I hope you will be convinced of it , by seeing them happy together .	2195.6400775150587
and to see dear Wickham too !	5522.385991496455
It is well .	4383.228203743676
Miss Bingley made no answer ;	4345.409034303013
Lizzy is not a bit better than the others ;	6146.405684107297
will she be as tall as I am ?	8289.859429498652
His marriage was now fast approaching , and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable , and even repeatedly to say in an ill-natured tone that she wished they might be happy .	3162.1710044372194
Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation .	5358.8757130591675
Every time they met , it was more decided and remarkable .	5178.190301403545
and he scarcely opened his lips .	4690.913316906812
Her sister , however , assured her , of her being perfectly well ;	3738.6943231163373
It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on such occasions it is the etiquette ;	3442.487223960163
My temper I dare not vouch for .	6142.306918448304
Anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn .	5138.664502505482
You have a very small park here , returned Lady Catherine after a short silence .	3648.227486961189
They lagged behind , while Elizabeth , Kitty , and Darcy , were to entertain each other .	3540.3351670658994
it was really attentive ;	8732.464109806726
That you certainly shall .	10175.539563884608
and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance , were I distractedly in love with him , I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance .	2798.777762628652
her daughters , alarmed , anxious , uneasy .	8155.439248162071
but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer , larger picture of him than this .	4220.595093186578
While Mary is adjusting her ideas , he continued , let us return to Bingley .	4628.483584435311
If he did shrug his shoulders , it was not till Sir William was out of sight .	3022.6664948378348
I do not get on at all .	2306.267571406104
What should not you mind ?	8885.506660346648
And since this sad affair has taken place , it is said , that he left Meryton greatly in debt ;	3709.784876988586
Let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many mortifications , for the sake of discovering them .	2854.71133627266
it is a handsome face .	6935.608788680347
Vain indeed must be all her attentions , vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself , if he were already self-destined to another .	3990.3069787782133
I don't know .	7007.366231656517
One must speak a little , you know .	5174.256044514698
Who that knows what his misfortunes have been , can help feeling an interest in him ?	5091.154767526765
and , while pretending to admire her work , said in a whisper , Go to your father , he wants you in the library .	3232.2490450306277
Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character , and as she stood before the canvas , on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before ;	3183.0142261273754
F1 .	40535.86118978839
I am perfectly satisfied .	3635.0962240342915
Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure .	3452.9197166346416
For we must attribute this happy conclusion , she added , in a great measure , to his kindness .	3509.206044901065
With astonishment did Elizabeth see , that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself .	4083.994685751147
Section 2 .	25166.476854978322
Jane was beyond competition her favourite child .	6791.569645022696
When first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him ;	3921.548575660576
Mary wished to say something very sensible , but knew not how .	5844.48426737569
Perhaps , said Darcy , I should have judged better , had I sought an introduction , but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers .	3096.8802661387613
If an individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are located in the United States , we do not claim a right to prevent you from copying , distributing , performing , displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg are removed .	3072.3521846101116
F4 .	40535.86118978839
Elizabeth coloured , and said A little .	4961.746623114994
She then yawned again , threw aside her book , and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement ;	3875.8113606805155
Two days after Bennet's return , as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them , and , concluding that she came to call them to their mother , went forward to meet her ;	3017.3197576325647
Email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and official page at <URL> For additional contact information : Gregory B Newby Chief Executive and Director gbnewby<MENTION> .	4625.069029025975
Elizabeth said no more but her mind could not acquiesce .	5374.941884837967
Collins , seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her , but Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine's being rather displeased by her staying at home .	2932.1440026468
on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree , for in Darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against another .	3733.6577222480755
It is Wickham's intention to go into the regulars ;	4172.8188327048565
She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at , and it was rather too early to begin .	3221.2973649109804
Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house ;	4591.901689538713
and whether she wished or feared it most , she could scarcely determine .	4300.7208689274885
and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss De Bourgh , which I am certain he has very much at heart .	2876.2480816229017
its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines , crowded with the young and the gay , and dazzling with scarlet ;	5340.039918110159
who attended to you ?	10565.092866066314
Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way .	4599.67926200728
His character was decided .	7444.079840256273
was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs .	7623.686651508507
Come , Darcy , said he , I must have you dance .	3461.3528649233717
but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , Gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible .	2766.1622026819873
No , Lizzy , that is what I do not choose .	2912.223136502334
He is as fine a fellow , said Bennet , as soon as they were out of the house , as ever I saw .	1891.7314868347862
and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford between our pools at quadrille , while Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh's foot-stool , that she said , 'Collins , you must marry .	2992.1599388152813
They could describe an entertainment with accuracy , relate an anecdote with humour , and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit .	4415.4500147673425
It would vex me , indeed , to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard .	3316.9643432953035
Your cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings .	7206.708285532023
However , I recollected afterwards , that if he had been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for Darcy might have done as well .	3420.589642385939
Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets ;	7091.048075972657
Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts , sarcastic humour , reserve , and caprice , that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character .	3418.601459586237
You are mistaken .	5750.917725560593
and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that Jane must soon cease to regard it , in the enjoyment of his .	2588.291449716998
Two inferences , however , were plainly deduced from the whole ;	5468.799682423421
Oh !	5043.244884590713
He is a gentleman ;	5120.5420960477595
Believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention ;	4478.630681975763
and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh , I think it will be very tolerable .	2948.14916183344
Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin's praise ;	4664.978997390298
and returned no more , till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining-parlour .	4110.455646365721
and when she rose to take leave , Elizabeth , ashamed of her mother's ungracious and reluctant good wishes , and sincerely affected herself , accompanied her out of the room .	2786.823046307403
She saw him start at this , but he said nothing , and she continued , You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it .	2538.094927751704
very true , it will be wise in me to refrain from that .	5126.000374682175
No , replied Jane , I have not forgotten him ;	2615.1091425156524
Every disposition of the ground was good ;	8392.889704720388
You never see a fault in any body .	5194.079659596279
Consider Collins's respectability , and Charlotte's prudent , steady character .	7209.5373454967275
I now give it to you , if you are resolved on having him .	3034.907416193615
Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy .	6490.381175583281
and as she named their relationship to herself , she stole a sly look at him , to see how he bore it ;	2669.0873430419397
Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane ;	4597.929574746321
You write uncommonly fast .	9273.679930200067
Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation , but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view .	4711.571022207688
In his present behaviour to herself , moreover , she had a fresh source of displeasure , for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance , could only serve , after what had since passed , to provoke her .	3099.858763357258
Well , that was very decided indeed that does seem as if but however , it may all come to nothing you know .	3868.9574197134993
Mamma would like to go too of all things !	8159.439266600196
By tea-time however the dose had been enough , and Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again , and when tea was over , glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies .	3420.4799559612006
Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family , she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort .	3540.6527526845944
but she was proud of him .	2646.941350487466
What are men to rocks and mountains ?	7296.663804461307
Well , much good may it do them !	5717.219144321227
If he had not had a family of his own , I and my children must have had all his money you know , and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him , except a few presents .	2800.3782141389192
They met several times , for there was much to be discussed .	4613.906276687274
The quiet , the retirement of such a life , would have answered all my ideas of happiness !	3983.752211306749
I only want to think you perfect , and you set yourself against it .	3569.834100713256
Of Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well ;	5065.490102487671
Chuse properly , chuse a gentlewoman for my sake ;	8676.696841663472
Among those who are at all his equals in consequence , he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous .	4123.129046715899
Those that best pleased her , as placing his conduct in the noblest light , seemed most improbable .	5447.309896634581
His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped , and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment , maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance , and except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth , requiring no partner in his pleasure .	3267.5064735358465
Collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said , thanking her for every fish he won , and apologising if he thought he won too many .	4288.009818276979
I have been a disappointed man , and my spirits will not bear solitude .	3001.5312748445913
They solaced their wretchedness , however , by duets after supper , while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister .	3276.9392785534274
for his chief wish at present , was to have as little trouble in the business as possible .	3850.6345416946388
Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions , but answered them very composedly .	4679.036179673468
and their mother's fortune , though ample for her situation in life , could but ill supply the deficiency of his .	3704.3526136965884
You must write again very soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last .	3310.7214044065736
They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas ;	7166.3466910896705
So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper , or her affectionate heart .	4429.46564219923
and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament ;	3370.9041268980695
Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation , that he never again distressed himself , or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth , by introducing the subject of it ;	3330.2958321715887
At such an assembly as this , it would be insupportable .	4272.694860244792
From what can it proceed ?	9444.128222058469
Her father was walking about the room , looking grave and anxious .	4365.427826204131
The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion .	4924.618816894331
my dear father , she cried , come back , and write immediately .	4011.678612254066
As to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say she could not positively answer but she did not know of any prepossession ;	3175.4845275658568
I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed !	4243.441068880971
He has more to give .	5509.834029422664
An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched ;	8067.217148434729
Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to , it was not on her side a scheme of infamy .	4377.024156938346
Their taking her home , and affording her their personal protection and countenance , is such a sacrifice to her advantage , as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge .	4344.868223243987
and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes , but his eagerness to grasp at any thing .	3248.6633448906027
I believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as I wished it in reason .	4356.216421306946
My sisters may write to me .	5024.675866146187
No , no , nonsense , Lizzy .	4339.1015477560795
John told us Darcy was here when you sent for us ;	7426.670446665448
Not , however , from any fear of disadvantage from it , individually to herself ;	4115.987852526652
Many smiled ;	19470.79310679769
It is impossible .	4760.39273556605
She was convinced that she could have been happy with him ;	2550.0197803268043
All !	27101.24028519643
While I can have my mornings to myself , said she , it is enough .	3300.392756323001
One day's delay she observed , would be of small importance ;	5977.631137868868
I flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so .	3238.904773578594
He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday , to say that he had arrived in safety , and to give me his directions , which I particularly begged him to do .	2768.5918240055094
There could not exist in the world two men , over whom Darcy could have such boundless influence .	4443.011043184748
I never was .	4962.3067701266245
Her uncle and aunt were all amazement ;	5951.633042204496
The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story , gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach ;	4374.781794675587
In 2001 , the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations .	3426.4644230702484
and , as far as their acquaintance reached , there was no fault to find .	3072.4120294596332
and , in the imprudence of anger , took the first opportunity of saying , with sneering civility , Pray , Miss Eliza , are not the shire militia removed from Meryton ?	3032.4848202511535
It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong ;	3321.9176821974957
I knew it to be a most respectable , agreeable corps , and my friend Denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters , and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them .	2728.1594867520703
They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother .	4599.4115042114145
They were able to love each other , even as well as they intended .	3692.930993501652
Wickham will never marry a woman without some money .	6750.923480225557
That is the most unforgiving speech , said Elizabeth , that I ever heard you utter .	2899.5647843112138
How despicably have I acted !	9339.692961248946
I am sure , said she , I cried for two days together when Colonel Millar's regiment went away .	1857.1194531136118
Then addressing her daughter , Oh !	5486.020278983258
she added , by far too much .	4913.504487173385
I know my own strength , and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming .	3354.2702115303814
I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter , that I had known it , and purposely kept it from him .	2537.6155050496964
He owns it himself without disguise .	7502.2425566205875
and though , in looking forward , neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity , could be justly expected for her sister ;	3326.4258287222506
Wickham's attention was caught ;	13808.765024658916
Excuse me for I must speak plainly .	9878.87940473517
cried Gardiner .	15161.169658585568
Your mother insists upon your accepting it .	5220.471885027089
so easy , that every servant will cheat you ;	6407.418261899415
Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself ?	8651.162512387718
You used us abominably ill , answered Hurst , in running away without telling us that you were coming out .	4115.6900050994
and all three being actuated by one spirit , every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled .	3942.702550427962
and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane ;	3936.1296477364663
Oh !	5043.244884590713
He had always intended to visit him , though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go ;	3427.474415358384
Perhaps I am not doing her justice .	5713.19433095791
Oh !	5043.244884590713
How long has she been such a favourite ?	7066.383175110377
You had much better dance .	6407.017213281085
for she was in no cheerful humour .	5687.1701628289775
I certainly have had my share of beauty , but I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now .	2676.661894123878
Elizabeth asked questions in vain ;	7366.76789818779
I am sure I do not know .	1264.4265588308713
How wonderfully these sort of things occur !	7525.661088294749
Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure .	6843.426707495104
I am very glad to hear such a good account of her , said Lady Catherine ;	2834.924701333806
but I will make her know it .	3379.2555405095936
I am sorry , exceedingly sorry , replied Darcy , in a tone of surprise and emotion , that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness .	2625.666743946993
But when they had withdrawn , he said to her , Bennet , before you take any , or all of these houses , for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding .	3246.5639234850432
LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a defect in this electronic work within <TIME_PERIOD > of receiving it , you can receive a refund of the money ( if any ) you paid for it by sending a written explanation to the person you received the work from .	3932.524368538792
If she is half as sharp as her mother , she is saving enough .	3938.8947828869077
and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate , she began to regret that he came .	3442.455652282131
If he no longer cares for me , why silent ?	5009.27839130476
and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town , as Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them , on their first coming to London , before they procured lodgings .	2684.4207677322534
But I suppose you had no opportunity .	4593.226081611953
But Bennet , who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday , which would exactly finish Jane's week , could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before .	3155.6310376316255
and , for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings , care not how much I may be wounding your's .	2809.6426060068734
and lastly , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked .	2828.507001821561
that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders , and that the business had been compromised accordingly .	4491.138115248833
Bingley had not been of age two years , when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House .	3917.3859044391643
Their journey was performed without much conversation , or any alarm ;	5694.940929794574
Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do .	4826.079035003125
but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us , if I had not perceived , by Jane's letter last Wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it , and therefore what I now tell you , can give you no fresh pain .	2833.5554610536083
In the former were many good paintings ;	6178.845209590445
and if you can compass it , do cure the younger girls of running after the officers .	3668.063311842105
Collins will be very glad of your company , I am sure .	3106.600482685305
When he was gone , they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on , and their uncle promised , at parting , to prevail on Bennet to return to Longbourn , as soon as he could , to the great consolation of his sister , who considered it as the only security for her husband's not being killed in a duel .	2844.765943274538
and thirdly which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness .	2842.3074913936503
Elizabeth shook her head over this letter .	5554.958842536697
Do your sisters play and sing ?	8404.502969192583
When the ladies removed after dinner , Elizabeth ran up to her sister , and seeing her well guarded from cold , attended her into the drawing-room ;	3178.591592427454
He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man ;	4868.99291205561
I hardly know how Collins was first introduced to her notice , but he certainly has not known her long .	3646.617833871307
and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters , and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense .	3473.322900217517
To Jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merit she had undervalued ;	4211.101129591825
It settled the matter ;	7593.350028127558
Collins might never make the offer , and till he did , it was useless to quarrel about him .	3564.7964454755856
no , my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both .	5495.786748901726
It was more than civil ;	4821.925397283672
If it were merely a fine house richly furnished , said she , I should not care about it myself ;	2649.1878968426954
She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man ;	3553.859570582868
Bennet deigned not to make any reply ;	6491.843954476931
Had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place ?	5449.409803959638
Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed , and , while her courage was high , she immediately said , Darcy , I am a very selfish creature ;	3336.163559664616
When Bennet wrote again to his brother , therefore , he sent his permission for them to come ;	3807.4375712222777
but how could that be ?	7603.279080853221
And a special licence .	8273.140340730311
and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them , he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing , and called out to her , My dear Miss Eliza , why are not you dancing ?	2894.740428246276
Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all , but she could see it and write of it without material pain .	3307.9462559875938
She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way .	3075.309252922568
Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from Charlotte , as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling .	4064.1145068193096

My father bears it better .	5825.908392314981
Mary was obliged to mix more with the world , but she could still moralize over every morning visit ;	3981.222796015065
I am going to-morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality , who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him .	3023.5018705108632
and the good-natured wishes for her well-doing , which had proceeded before , from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton , lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances , because with such an husband , her misery was considered certain .	3338.1519009112826
Two offences of a very different nature , and by no means of equal magnitude , you last night laid to my charge .	4168.076255218711
She supposed , if he meant any thing , he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter .	3848.8932548582366
Redistribution is subject to the trademark license , especially commercial redistribution .	7908.588856931653
but the emotion was short , and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued .	3924.171331672782
Very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia , whose own misery was extreme , and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family .	3164.2984968732544
Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable ;	6107.66516846219
Do you prefer reading to cards ?	7470.910529856151
where is your sash my dear ?	10852.828565518492
but I thought I might as well buy it as not .	3576.9539769659045
But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together ;	3797.3261173413434
CHAPTER III .	14734.305895909685
Soon after their return , a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet ;	6103.330544401298
and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there , recurring to her mind , the few minutes in which they continued together , were some of the most uncomfortable of her life .	3024.79367202049
Jane listened with astonishment and concern ;	8187.429825218298
We must have Long and the Gouldings soon .	5947.885701697375
Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer ;	4668.216814060976
and while Sir William accompanied him , Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house , extremely well pleased , probably , to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's help .	3245.9732766379557
He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance , but that is all .	3385.072523905973
It is the greatest of favours when Miss De Bourgh comes in .	3842.7924326216607
They had long wished to see him .	3561.2585269589244
At length the chaise arrived , the trunks were fastened on , the parcels placed within , and it was pronounced to be ready .	3898.8390436196414
I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way .	2706.9629841977608
for thither Collins had followed him after breakfast , and there he would continue , nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection , but really talking to Bennet , with little cessation , of his house and garden at Hunsford .	3296.2381852700596
He , who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open pleasantry .	3979.5500641754993
Compared with some families , I believe we were ;	7359.868288758922
In this room they were received by Miss Darcy , who was sitting there with Hurst and Miss Bingley , and the lady with whom she lived in London .	2397.6236796040826
She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it ;	3686.6578873843314
Do not give way to useless alarm , added he , though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain .	3295.2874585100685
but Collins , after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will , and should never resent her behaviour as any affront , seated himself at another table with Bennet , and prepared for backgammon .	3852.964655678122
A younger son , you know , must be inured to self-denial and dependence .	4436.377328326792
We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word .	4642.105069091099
Yes , or I will never see her again .	3693.583854152028
You have shewn him off now much more than he did himself .	3985.146156955013
From what we have seen of him , continued Gardiner , I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body , as he has done by poor Wickham .	3226.7945810803076
She had known , it seems , of their being in love with each other , many weeks .	2788.7223077958565
I have , Very well .	3099.857824132016
Through letters , whatever of good or bad was to be told , would be communicated , and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance .	3872.209919891562
It is fortunate , then , that they fall to my lot instead of to yours .	3413.618030172458
Tell him what a dreadful state I am in , that I am frightened out of my wits ;	4120.201112039905
The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings dreadful .	6357.181401401423
Because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement .	6813.687625298895
She could not bear such suspense ;	4951.950112785059
And quite alone ?	11138.349087913432
Nor did that day wear out her resentment .	8433.490703214866
In ran Bennet to her daughter's room , in her dressing gown , and with her hair half finished , crying out , My dear Jane , make haste and hurry down .	3444.1438586820022
what does he say ?	10204.505012423491
sir , I do indeed .	8984.548913280172
Is it true ?	13306.80581461302
They could not be untouched by his politeness , and had they drawn his character from their own feelings , and his servant's report , without any reference to any other account , the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known , would not have recognised it for Darcy .	2913.913590507556
but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right .	4256.862186022762
What made you so shy of me , when you first called , and afterwards dined here ?	4374.988901143944
If it was not allowable for him to gain my affections , because I had no money , what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about , and who was equally poor ?	3019.708617114358
and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me .	3569.2125351508034
Till this moment , I never knew myself .	6153.638779654459
She looked forward to their entrance , as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend .	3918.28004485229
He was not seated by her ;	4543.00208775372
a respectable-looking , elderly woman , much less fine , and more civil , than she had any notion of finding her .	3913.443225518161
but Elizabeth , less clear-sighted perhaps in his case than in Charlotte's , did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence .	3859.6847590883945
who should do it but her own uncle ?	8069.5186486972
She respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his welfare ;	3265.335902304698
He is a sweet tempered , amiable , charming man .	4051.7894622733306
I want to know , said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister's , what you have learnt about Wickham .	2639.71006686657
Such a disappointment !	13016.706368646488
It is often only carelessness of opinion , and sometimes an indirect boast .	3895.545093945812
I have just had a letter from Jane , with such dreadful news .	2949.9827239012347
Her heart did whisper , that he had done it for her .	2525.835064898795
Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet's general habits , she was absolutely incredulous here .	4417.102018495462
we will ask you no questions .	10645.18302737001
It was dated from Rosings , at eight o'clock in the morning , and was as follows : Be not alarmed , Madam , on receiving this letter , by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments , or renewal of those offers , which were last night so disgusting to you .	2742.892215355676
Her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating .	5042.481967560858
When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen , they returned down stairs , and taking leave of the housekeeper , were consigned over to the gardener , who met them at the hall door .	3747.7006351682508
cried Gardiner , whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive .	4724.3019233999485
made no mention of the business that had taken him away , and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it .	2978.3292243915616
for he was discovered to be proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased ;	4030.1457236521414
Every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world ;	3426.6267142563584
A few days after this visit , Bingley called again , and alone .	4777.353583859918
Elizabeth was determined ;	6729.672726610531
and then was enraged against herself for being so silly !	4565.427773130707
I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly .	4391.127976271529
Wickham , Lydia , were all forgotten .	6899.653057891301
Oh !	5043.244884590713
But it is fortunate , thought she , that I have something to wish for .	2618.49155756686
He has been here this half hour , and master has had a letter .	3832.9811879259855
our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered ;	10243.406039004176
But I cannot I have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly .	3398.2464839269783
Charlotte had hardly time to answer , before they were joined by Kitty , who came to tell the same news , and no sooner had they entered the breakfast-room , where Bennet was alone , than she likewise began on the subject , calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion , and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family .	2987.4247323855893
I have not forgot , you see ;	3632.474281470139
and during part of that time , Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Bingley , who came from the dance for a few minutes , to press his friend to join it .	2891.552829114292
cried Elizabeth , when she had finished .	3786.0148764051896
But every line proved more clearly that the affair , which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent , as to render Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous , was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole .	3342.8330143544085
and had any thing of the kind been perceptible , you must be aware that ours is not a family , on which it could be thrown away .	2663.990731441753
Bennet , to whose apartment they all repaired , after a few minutes conversation together , received them exactly as might be expected ;	3462.9314638341807
and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air , with such a companion .	3412.2279662992205
Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening .	3481.932273269953
for , if I recollect right , he went but the day before .	3739.5152387067815
The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire , you must know , was at a ball and at this ball , what do you think he did ?	3113.1659508790704
the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me .	3498.2051564599346
I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not .	2954.0451989799494
Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now .	4086.373850290425
It has often led him to be liberal and generous , to give his money freely , to display hospitality , to assist his tenants , and relieve the poor .	3652.2696589658894
The discussion of Collins's offer was now nearly at an end , and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother .	3081.118340095775
and her invitation was accepted with alacrity .	4948.417917125758
On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn ;	4420.116812921641
Sir William Lucas , and his daughter Maria , a good humoured girl , but as empty-headed as himself , had nothing to say that could be worth hearing , and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise .	3172.781068000148
CHAPTER I Miss Bingley's letter arrived , and put an end to doubt .	4972.9946381550635
Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph 1 .	4363.306832044417
and by a manoeuvre of Bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone , which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family .	2913.0462646803417
I know your disposition , Lizzy .	3992.302536954229
When the clock struck three , Elizabeth felt that she must go ;	4245.2640367057775
And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth !	5154.18120919575
And I certainly never shall give it .	4481.143934247763
but we will hope at some future period , to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known , and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence .	3645.492073979259
But I have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected .	3566.2984673282813
Young ladies of her age , are sometimes a little difficult to manage , and if she has the true Darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way .	3728.4145499569154
to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before Collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery .	3546.9601639327852
How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Darcy , for now they do appear wholly undeserved .	4128.245621509676
I understand that Collins has made you an offer of marriage .	3985.245690172331
Such was Miss Lucas's scheme ;	10487.393944966603
and she coloured at the idea ;	4234.271523718308
This room was my late master's favourite room , and these miniatures are just as they used to be then .	4398.6206795771695
You promised me to insist upon her marrying him .	4193.020773221468
and I am sure if I had been you , I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it .	1972.0203399931006
At length , however , the question was asked by her uncle ;	3894.9383906940675
Darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours .	4813.705516619086
She wished to discredit it entirely , repeatedly exclaiming , This must be false !	4864.063953501639
for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though George Wickham has treated Darcy in a most infamous manner .	2952.84963450853
This letter gave Elizabeth some pain ;	7661.190072372241
In marrying your nephew , I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere .	4067.4927323930488
I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading !	4725.131182378515
I hope your plans in favour of the shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood .	3046.865498208806
I cannot misunderstand you , but I intreat you , dear Lizzy , not to pain me by thinking that person to blame , and saying your opinion of him is sunk .	3123.518564881441
Miss Bennet , I insist on being satisfied .	4434.514980999128
Oh !	5043.244884590713
Yes , she did .	4940.172755306072
How odious I should think them !	6924.855843669015
and if he had the fortune he ought to have , I should think you could not do better .	2439.125209296453
Unless where they like women of fortune , which I think they very often do .	4856.436836914379
CHAPTER IV .	11147.934488852214
She soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt , who did call on him in her return through London , and there relate her journey to Longbourn , its motive , and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth ;	2968.4953169903756
but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her .	3837.6641506738183
My sole dependence was on you ;	6688.7508494880485
My fingers wait your orders .	7766.004435213896
As for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin Elizabeth .	3076.644244411926
Certainly .	31556.4502942382
who can it be ?	12271.747704746698
and much as she had always been disposed to like him , she could not think without anger , hardly without contempt , on that easiness of temper , that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends , and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations .	3099.8303277184577
Since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and expedite a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with Wickham , he easily learnt , had never been his design .	3640.728895792079
and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of or I may say , three very silly sisters .	3445.857752620817
you are a great deal too apt you know , to like people in general .	4551.897620916113
Before any answer could arrive from Collins , or any congratulations to Elizabeth , from his wife , the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas lodge .	3893.584783398247
His words seemed to imply it .	5595.221027311064
Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment , after such an affront to Colonel Forster ?	4552.009701348641
and Collins was to attend them , at the request of Bennet , who was most anxious to get rid of him , and have his library to himself ;	2611.2619883901184
While thus engaged , Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ;	3595.414227067684
Perhaps there was some truth in this ;	7689.505395037786
was it so ?	15079.598552221292
I am glad of one thing , that he comes alone ;	2792.2697033732165
He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before ;	4425.0428900525685
She got up , and ran out of the room ;	3406.454385762633
There are a lot of things you can do with Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works .	2742.7844991668917
Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution ;	5494.103368960715
when he spoke , his accent had none of its usual sedateness ;	6660.203200201696
The darling wish of his sisters was then gratified ;	5725.814937975875
You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper .	4472.997653238624
She had been watching him the last hour , she said , as he walked up and down the street , and had Wickham appeared Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation , but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers , who in comparison with the stranger , were become stupid , disagreeable fellows .	2915.177429982634
Money !	40535.86118978839
This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening , in summer ;	4017.843814876341
At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal , if he had not been well assured of his cousin's corroboration .	2952.3862660157756
Ah !	25580.072097342923
The paling of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side .	4918.830149723305
But I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed .	3343.8493522734016
1 .	9967.378404281952
she was aware that no one liked him but Jane ;	5610.268300105213
Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight ;	6706.899311998656
and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last .	3009.6111586935567
I defy even Sir William Lucas himself , to produce a more valuable son-in-law .	4510.726850963886
and not a day went by without a solitary walk , in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections .	3624.782289202546
and Elizabeth began to like them herself , when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for Jane .	3256.0263608246614
The gentlemen came ;	8377.334786804618
I have seen them both .	3517.7896273192273
I beg your pardon .	5293.333078611378
But there were other causes of repugnance ;	5632.104053278897
This , madam , is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together ;	4190.453158367536
and yet how many things have happened !	5339.863668726746
I only fear that the sort of cautiousness , to which you , I imagine , have been alluding , is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe .	3323.509373019602
The one missent must be first attended to ;	6101.271214124252
and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia's connections , which is not likely , can I suppose her so lost to every thing ?	3281.683327360991
and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind .	3182.798902446474
and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal .	3841.5259194326045
To the little town of Lambton , the scene of Gardiner's former residence , and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained , they bent their steps , after having seen all the principal wonders of the country ;	3696.5331813596317
yet she received them with tolerable ease , and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment , or any unnecessary complaisance .	4163.78790533335
Come here , child , cried her father as she appeared .	6224.07917775756
Bingley , she had likewise seen for an instant , and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed .	3841.378496269979
They were , therefore , to go .	3353.0377508054075
That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask .	4281.9575802117515
I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere .	4542.159563284601
What are you telling Miss Bennet ?	6695.160991928042
It seems an hopeless business .	6541.881147274081
I hate such false friends .	5998.358887113493
He is come Bingley is come .	5439.735745265716
and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual , and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation .	2925.5648996810014
I am not qualified to form one .	3033.9602234731847
Yes , Ma'am , all .	4522.02829245656
She liked him too little to care for his approbation .	5460.448307270538
Oh !	5043.244884590713
CHAPTER VI .	11147.934488852214
I think not .	5041.457881365595
and then added , May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left and Collins well .	3537.123523559882
My dear Jane , I am in such a flutter , that I am sure I can't write ;	1779.1695893963672
Where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant , distance becomes no evil .	5559.614530549696
She asked her at different times , how many sisters she had , whether they were older or younger than herself , whether any of them were likely to be married , whether they were handsome , where they had been educated , what carriage her father kept , and what had been her mother's maiden name ?	3100.6797312645667
We can all plague and punish one another .	6384.6860868153735
At length Darcy spoke , and in a constrained manner said , Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them , is less certain .	3587.258442733947
E1 .	27672.02912185821
Towards him I have been kinder than towards myself .	6461.651698891957
Indeed , Darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire and , give me leave to say , very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate , and such things may come out , as will shock your relations to hear .	3177.737538320183
Could she exert herself it would be better , but this is not to be expected ;	3712.679373258652
A glass of wine ;	10806.684507781887
She performed her part indeed without much graciousness , but Bennet was satisfied , and soon afterwards ordered her carriage .	4251.929744477156
That is as it happens .	6587.190784002682
Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself , that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking , which ceased when he saw her no more ;	3358.183131069918
Maria would tell her nothing more , and down they ran into the dining-room , which fronted the lane , in quest of this wonder ;	4232.7280862738435
Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly .	10625.532590920435
But , my dear sister , can I be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere ?	3072.0294774360946
All young ladies accomplished !	12558.458503569149
Yes , vanity is a weakness indeed .	5355.230795533859
Elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again , she wanted Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her .	3473.1338890660563
but whether always charming , it is not for me to determine .	3588.123964731246
In short , I will do my best .	5384.4261060213885
Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday ;	9712.79624581483
Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them ;	4789.317754363437
But this idea was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw Darcy walk into the room .	2786.207586263891
And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley .	3237.9788067505897
till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of Bingley , and her being the sister of Jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding , made every body eager for another , to supply the idea .	3489.385143014132
Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service .	3074.023392777598
Are they indeed ?	14523.376245274063
And then , with a slight bow , turned again into the plantation , and was soon out of sight .	3260.8193923415993
CHAPTER VIII .	12871.90986889334
She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do ;	3151.8554308293233
I will take care of myself , and of Wickham too .	3000.430177888931
He addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet , with a polite congratulation ;	3683.8179041290673
Between the two eldest and herself especially , there subsisted a very particular regard .	5965.694717577857
She was afraid of talking longer of his friend ;	3861.160828504849
I did not think you would ;	3852.7455691125797
and as a punishment for him , as well as a possible advantage to Jane , she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Darcy's sister , as , by Wickham's account , she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away .	2628.6394046815844
Take whatever you like , and get away .	7505.0298255471835
Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year , which , unfortunately for his daughters , was entailed in default of heirs male , on a distant relation ;	4045.803780205538
That he is as false and deceitful , as he is insinuating .	4790.191414893316
The whist party soon afterwards breaking up , the players gathered round the other table , and Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Philips .	3940.4561687515525
Oxford , Blenheim , Warwick , Kenelworth , Birmingham , c .	6251.277171844122
The envelope itself was likewise full .	7100.185941837854
Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it ;	3751.076259534647
CHAPTER XV .	11147.934488852214
and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well .	2803.7876826443458
cried Lydia .	11249.79761341604
The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit , and the result of it was , that the youngest should tax Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield .	2870.1160292559725
You make me laugh , Charlotte ;	7624.604393027438
Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk ;	6119.266034098222
Did Charlotte dine with you ?	8926.009601435226
for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort springs from a breach of promise , for I ought not to have mentioned the subject ?	4019.936681985195
And till Colonel Forster came himself , not one of you entertained a doubt , I suppose , of their being really married ?	3362.336412364224
They had several children .	7324.5262304884955
But of every other neglect I can believe him capable .	5360.172696238063
and to complete the view , she saw herself seated beneath a tent , tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once .	3594.1804753922856
I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance .	3657.660212419991
and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my cards .	3341.460295355539
While in their cradles , we planned the union : and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished , in their marriage , to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly unallied to the family !	2996.2721702526037
It is not quite a week since they left Brighton .	3690.7004164108225
I should not mind any thing at all .	2706.5795897298503
You were Bingley's first choice .	6955.802208200588
I cannot see why Forster should not ask me as well as Lydia , said she , though I am not her particular friend .	2265.1525891862198
Bingley was punctual to his appointment ;	6998.00614515017
my dear , dear Jane , I am so happy !	2904.854767246876
and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once .	2985.4245580152287
So , do not put yourself to inconvenience .	7194.323674005555
And so , I suppose , they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead .	3197.1483198316446
How I long to see her again !	4489.407600350193
To Pemberley , therefore , they were to go .	3260.2524826235986
You have widely mistaken my character , if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these .	3636.6643045140963
Here are officers enough at Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country .	4168.9587610005
But on the following morning , every hope of this kind was done away .	3940.2536900261753
He was silent .	5153.075994578092
cried Wickham with a look which did not escape her .	5031.714295683743
I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's connections .	3906.720463078925
Well , if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own , so much the better .	3348.070919325644
Lady Catherine seemed resigned .	6676.75184737152
Your great men often are ;	9911.559610726665
He declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister's attachment ;	4488.93483680758
My dearest Lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Darcy , to be treating his father's favourite in such a manner , one , whom his father had promised to provide for .	3199.3330598754815
Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks , online payments and credit card donations .	6086.782957189203
a report which highly incensed Bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood .	5010.029202346395
Do let me ask my partner to introduce you .	5217.712859227667
and while she steadily repressed it , could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing , that however long , and for whatever cause , his attentions had been withdrawn , her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal .	3503.514798779518
my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken .	6885.674636310925
The next was in these words .	5915.266353018457
Her ladyship was highly incensed .	8425.614725049783
To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate !	6219.274998095026
In this perturbed state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on ;	4668.193988221117
but , though she always kept a very good table , she did not think any thing less than two courses , could be good enough for a man , on whom she had such anxious designs , or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a-year .	3080.2951614131666
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him ;	3205.7013696649447
he has some friends , though perhaps not so many as he deserves .	6149.663194926591
They will ruin your happiness .	6228.319007637081
and at the age of twenty-seven , without having ever been handsome , she felt all the good luck of it .	2681.6272921894815
From what I can collect , he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them .	4003.0510487785964
Could she have seen half as much love in Darcy for herself , she would have ordered her wedding clothes .	4315.1680623844095
The horses were post ;	8926.001600662377
Well , and what news does it bring ?	5332.3132885132745
Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning , and writing to Jane , while Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village , when she was startled by a ring at the door , the certain signal of a visitor .	2881.3348125838443
Thoughtlessness , want of attention to other people's feelings , and want of resolution , will do the business .	4977.325094922803
There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended ;	5108.194900875588
You doubt me , cried Jane , slightly colouring ;	5858.104269791378
The possibility of meeting Darcy , while viewing the place , instantly occurred .	4648.907217316744
No , that I am sure I shall not ;	2013.5227370474408
and she made the most of the time , by visiting about with her daughter , and having very frequent parties at home .	2907.0809631055363
But she had chosen it with her eyes open ;	4769.289995304434
He is nothing to us , you know , and I am sure I never want to see him again .	1699.4510790148063
Lydia does not leave me because she is married ;	6968.249277342391
My love , should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much ?	4488.756215489882
Another intreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the desired effect ;	4603.9557988977895
We have tried two or three subjects already without success , and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine .	3786.499931011655
Of course , we hope that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work .	3283.5040461282088
and the girls smiled on each other .	3261.341418247174
and if she were married to him to-morrow , I should think she had as good a chance of happiness , as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth .	2716.6009217168507
Your humility , Bingley , said Elizabeth , must disarm reproof .	3721.165421129558
How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own daughters I cannot understand ;	4948.712176021981
and her features are not at all handsome .	4107.765127881748
You observed it , Darcy , I am sure , said Miss Bingley ;	1811.5793359686884
I know you will do him such ample justice , that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent .	3130.257243565701
It cannot last long .	6506.284456441994
no , no , this is not likely .	6386.992252590417
If he had another motive , I am sure it would never disgrace him .	2468.668148674029
Well , well , I only hope it will last .	4075.882612804993
In a fortnight they were to go , and once gone , she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account .	3597.4290647360385
I appeal to Darcy : but let me not interrupt you , You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady , whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me .	3547.2801684664487
And for this we are to be thankful .	5550.43634116403
Miss Bennet still looked all amazement .	7316.234958080454
She became jealous of his esteem , when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it .	3031.612524015947
but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming , she had no wish of her recovering immediately , as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield .	3363.15975240515
I was given good principles , but left to follow them in pride and conceit .	4362.925574084475
for though I am the youngest , I'm the tallest .	5081.912746251005
You are over scrupulous surely .	6231.47320211058
and she turned away with alarm , while Reynolds replied , that he was , adding , but we expect him to-morrow , with a large party of friends .	2643.5013806130205
yes .	23041.743585223387
I thank you , again and again , for not going to the Lakes .	3352.0364269054917
I know them a little .	4864.98304745269
and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send .	4616.862781916553
How could you begin ?	8446.283159719444
But I am at his disposal .	4289.435736018499
There was no help for it however .	5648.715436558876
Thank God !	21854.180232861334
It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth ;	3535.117385333515
oh !	37379.51187044091
what's his name .	17638.107873397075
and the pleasure of being with Charlotte , and the kind attentions she had received , must make her feel the obliged .	2764.075803619207
Well girls , said she , as soon as they were left to themselves , What say you to the day ?	2545.6567132108084
Why should they not go on to Scotland , if that had been the case ?	4586.226036302379
All that I can promise you , therefore , is not to be in a hurry .	3176.1563858689287
My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly , to try to discover her .	3759.0550721256204
I wish I could say any thing to comfort you , replied Elizabeth ;	2836.4138746468166
But you know married women have never much time for writing .	5107.328402788187
it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited ;	4866.647577274318
And you saw the old housekeeper , I suppose ?	4965.471682899727
but Wickham was as far beyond them all in person , countenance , air , and walk , as they were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips , breathing port wine , who followed them into the room .	3100.661068611454
It was consoling , that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush .	3016.069047827458
Of his former way of life , nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself .	4911.1719391956585
there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her , and though by no means so clever as herself , she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her's , he might become a very agreeable companion .	3021.3794089185894
he replied , and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled .	3241.6771370440733
but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless .	5184.954527026691
But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment .	3054.322142315498
But I will not torment you with vain wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks .	3617.8907079618684
but such of us as wished to learn , never wanted the means .	5055.919622440839
Yes , Sir ;	6663.618087818706
In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else , and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room .	3349.179579481115
Bingley urged Jones's being sent for immediately ;	7521.162784381329
though it was some time , I confess , before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice .	3961.016803617092
and from such as had been already visible below , she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcy's , in crayons , whose subjects were usually more interesting , and also more intelligible .	3445.172190976974
I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies .	3955.29048316884
The whole party before them , indeed , excited a lively attention .	3786.6153898642633
I shall be back by dinner .	4009.8858407014327
and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do .	3323.7984191300975
You cannot have been always at Longbourn .	4577.166249225116
Well , my dear , said he , when she ceased speaking , I have no more to say .	1653.3450842895577
and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view , as he meant to chuse one of the daughters , if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report .	2869.869526498538
you mean Jane , I suppose because he danced with her twice .	5165.519663089106
Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor .	5884.977167955485
Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here ;	3993.6216003812697
Ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either , detection could not be in your power , and suspicion certainly not in your inclination .	4384.280641108112
Not handsome enough to dance with !	7121.990178830763
Elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak ;	4822.900400177977
How Darcy looked , therefore , she could not tell .	3208.5509819347853
Elizabeth was pleased , though , when she asked herself the reason , she had very little to say in reply .	2871.60428278164
Impossible , Bennet , impossible , when I am not acquainted with him myself ;	4401.555071306084
I told him , moreover , that I believed myself mistaken in supposing , as I had done , that your sister was indifferent to him ;	2802.4143944007046
and still thought there might have been time enough .	4473.68121029563
I shall not be able to keep you and so I warn you .	2397.8405762143693
My dear , dear Lydia !	4219.091829897515
It was owing to him , to his reserve , and want of proper consideration , that Wickham's character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was .	2537.1178048002544
It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened .	3907.7471720916747
Such a countenance , such manners !	8418.719950617322
Lydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself .	4469.313444936803
I know very well , madam , said he , that when persons sit down to a card table , they must take their chance of these things , and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object .	2606.3824968527065
While there was an officer in Meryton , they would flirt with him ;	4501.020909105536
they were dances of mortification .	10682.271358315362
CHAPTER XIII .	11147.934488852214
and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time .	2327.7026326216833
That is very true , said Elizabeth ;	3054.255056212111
But it was not to be .	2185.5137769575085
Elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced ;	5229.681405706453
She was going to the butcher's , she told me , on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday , and she has got three couple of ducks , just fit to be killed .	3183.6018976340874
she replied , endeavouring to recover herself .	5251.811960102172
The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time , and the plan became perfect as plan could be .	3525.5544422248927
It is enough to know they are discovered , I have seen them both Then it is , as I always hoped , cried Jane ;	2743.0452226820325
Only this ;	19248.18457165784
You judge very properly , said Bennet , and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy .	3306.696230972122
But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule .	3887.621699520142
I was only confused for the moment , because I felt that I should be looked at .	3127.577851340337
She began at length to recover , to fidget about in her chair , get up , sit down again , wonder , and bless herself .	3939.618288347112
her eldest daughter , she must just mention she felt it incumbent on her to hint , was likely to be very soon engaged .	3895.7182128482714
No , I believe not .	4510.755339499218
VOL .	25580.072097342923
for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone .	4945.267252882722
The far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances .	4911.878825824745
but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts , fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one , with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance .	3269.5942709878586
Pray write instantly , and let me understand it unless it is , for very cogent reasons , to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary ;	4405.916343061283
The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard , his claims on Darcy , and all that he had suffered from him , was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed ;	3043.327825043725
But when Elizabeth told of his silence , it did not seem very likely , even to Charlotte's wishes , to be the case ;	3178.229040822455
Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well-bred man , and talked very pleasantly ;	4655.980977267572
Into one house in this neighbourhood , they shall never have admittance .	7133.765042859958
But with me , it is not so .	2754.0490531371765
Nor was it under many , many minutes , that she could comprehend what she heard ;	4403.034945688523
It drew from her , however , the exertion of speaking , which nothing else had so effectually done before ;	3439.5525050410274
Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied , Yes , you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that .	3647.88629717881
Her air was not conciliating , nor was her manner of receiving them , such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank .	3851.4638758160036
When those dances were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by Darcy , who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him .	2628.3473837736315
She was very equal therefore to address Bingley on the subject of the ball , and abruptly reminded him of his promise ;	3086.1432616399966
Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning ;	3338.7659804958057
When dinner was over , she returned directly to Jane , and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room .	2151.879532832213
This young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way , with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire , splendid property , noble kindred , and extensive patronage .	4566.01031091108
Kitty is slight and delicate , and Mary studies so much , that her hours of repose should not be broken in on .	4052.835086887581
But I have always observed , that they who are good-natured when children , are good-natured when they grow up ;	3536.37662447452
but she still thought him partial to Jane , and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend's permission , or being bold enough to come without it .	2741.8587292418715
You must send John with the young ladies , Collins .	3931.748760073571
Pray read on .	10518.237592006648
CHAPTER XI .	12871.90986889334
but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it , and making her sister the excuse , said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book .	3480.7350164067507
but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal ;	3302.1627109457413
But we must stem the tide of malice , and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other , the balm of sisterly consolation .	3940.16953143205
the happiest , wisest , most reasonable end !	7902.020202951536
At that instant she felt , that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends , for moments of such painful confusion .	4494.61184570453
Not like the wild young men now-a-days , who think of nothing but themselves .	4866.4872200519285
I believe she did and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object .	2546.6467147056533
and Wickham , who happened to sit near Elizabeth , began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood , with a good humoured ease , which she felt very unable to equal in her replies .	3295.004233087928
and by her connivance and aid , he so far recommended himself to Georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement .	3101.8798438035647
How much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book !	5244.6503946660405
Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Darcy .	4545.589605639067
it cannot be .	9056.028251650838
His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own ;	4371.658242854832
he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield , and she blushed as she answered , I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family .	2597.42630585022
The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter , and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country .	3311.523369105457
What he means to do , I am sure I know not ;	2425.8437460042273
Generous , good man , I am afraid he has distressed himself .	4386.793031453999
His doing so drew her notice .	7648.672096512646
The consequence of it is , that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have , and that Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever .	3032.9443713228247
Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word .	3892.948215250028
Gardiner left them soon after breakfast .	7682.265760868661
To Darcy it was welcome intelligence Elizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough .	4810.382425450873
I knew how it would be I knew he would manage every thing .	3076.6069689713554
a father absent , a mother incapable of exertion , and requiring constant attendance ;	6262.143040269141
It was then disclosed in the following manner .	3964.218903002801
Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay , as they had been at first .	3443.792851892508
I need not explain myself farther ;	6266.447434570565
his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do .	4472.397229048231
Indeed you must go , for it will be impossible for us to visit him , if you do not .	2636.38417840828
Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends , that could materially lessen its weight .	5356.186797729942
and her uncle and aunt , leaving her to enjoy them in quiet , set off by themselves .	2898.525250959523
Well , he is a very undeserving young man and I do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now .	2677.0946516610297
and now , I hope you are satisfied .	3328.6685479585203
III .	37379.51187044091
In a doleful voice Bennet thus began the projected conversation .	5229.561236726754
But these , I suppose , are precisely what you are without .	3985.4187584314304
She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love , rather than by his ;	3165.387822079417
for a few minutes he was silent ;	5166.169266064871
It is a long time , Bingley , since you went away , said Bennet .	2318.8682795934383
no one was to be put in competition with him .	4564.10595669453
One has got all the goodness , and the other all the appearance of it .	2936.6754068337536
the eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt , there cannot be two opinions on that point .	4524.279011237
She answered him in the usual way , and after a moment's pause , added , My eldest sister has been in town these three months .	3203.793372079417
and Lady Lucas , who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken .	3433.4762048024622
It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man .	2947.3619243551907
Elizabeth , as she affectionately embraced her , whilst tears filled the eyes of both , lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives .	3462.910189266755
Long before it had taken place , my opinion of you was decided .	5716.065531675335
Dear , dear Lizzy .	11378.34583220444
But I can assure you , she added , that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy ;	2879.105459484504
When , after examining the mother , in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Darcy , she turned her eyes on the daughter , she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment , at her being so thin , and so small .	3281.4913233466036
The conduct of neither , if strictly examined , will be irreproachable ;	5163.677499700203
My mind was more agreeably engaged .	6965.829540260837
She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances , and she was in no humour to indulge him .	2805.6248248563597
He had certainly formed such a plan , and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend .	2976.3663498068454
True ;	33751.168826691726
whenever she was alone , she gave way to it as the greatest relief ;	6121.120560491017
The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner , and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank such affability and condescension , as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine .	2809.209244407924
And pray , Lizzy , what said Lady Catherine about this report ?	4705.013288491988
By the Author of Sense and Sensibility .	5314.7076966220275
But of all the views which his garden , or which the country , or the kingdom could boast , none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings , afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house .	3138.4289552130294
No thanks to his gallantry for that .	6449.5104114704045
and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see Darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea .	3479.3813390406553
Bennet , with great civility , begged her ladyship to take some refreshment ;	4318.1916184189495
An unhappy alternative is before you , Elizabeth .	6746.535346529942
and while Darcy was attending them to their carriage , Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth's person , behaviour , and dress .	3685.603315895758
Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted ?	7543.833070762424
I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband ;	3943.923187346618
Believe her to be deceived by all means .	7219.976129002699
and though more astonished than gratified herself , by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her .	2708.5188697094727
for she received an invitation from Forster , the wife of the Colonel of the regiment , to accompany her to Brighton .	3807.233599107373
It is almost past belief .	5268.981828770545
LIMITED WARRANTY , DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the Right of Replacement or Refund described in paragraph 1 .	4547.026791216833
The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements , with such news as the country afforded ;	4354.979666950588
Imagine our surprise .	17637.02251814876
but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded .	4003.754598767791
Good gracious !	13026.898755758692
and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world .	3278.374971455519
A low phaeton , with a nice little pair of ponies , would be the very thing .	3831.5346249273257
Your coming to Longbourn , to see me and my family , said Elizabeth , coolly , will be rather a confirmation of it ;	2782.487908406927
I am ashamed of you !	3960.318942691369
He is rich , to be sure , and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane .	2785.17116447016
Miss Darcy , though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations , readily obeyed .	3791.4567603712376
he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire , and Jane and Elizabeth , in addition to every other source of happiness , were within thirty miles of each other .	3194.701331630059
That he was surprised by the connexion was evident ;	5936.461245636922
A clear ten thousand per annum .	7945.937012272855
My dear Bennet , you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother .	2728.7272372963766
This is the only point , I flatter myself , on which we do not agree .	3994.430720175093
Four nieces of Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means ;	7423.545304217452
Till I can forget his father , I can never defy or expose him .	4172.600305213245
But now several minutes elapsed , without bringing the sound of his voice ;	4645.246990267956
had I known what I ought , what I dared , to do !	6168.196386388252
that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance !	5274.859052506986
Her power was sinking ;	10260.368820993162
1 .	9967.378404281952
and perhaps he might be doing the same .	5209.914477843313
Yes , he had no engagement at all for to-morrow ;	4221.817145453836
When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night , she followed her , and made the important communication .	3777.7694112151735
Yes , very indifferent indeed , said Elizabeth , laughingly .	3475.007346996276
Miss Elizabeth Bennet !	10614.732715484828
Elizabeth most thankfully consented , and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay , and bring back a supply of clothes .	3923.489190295495
Gardiner declared his willingness , and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation .	4738.786259709008
CHAPTER XIV .	11147.934488852214
I have no such injuries to resent .	4035.7476267375746
but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion , suffered no variation of colour .	4235.186929350188
Oh , Lydia !	7437.840079991913
But now it was all too natural .	5573.708846750568
but he seemed to like his second better .	4315.918055102719
My dear sir , replied Collins , I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship's concurrence .	3006.6274935614183
make haste , my love .	9762.482447324766
and he thought it an excellent one , full of eligibility and suitableness , and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part .	3869.1520356732944
He enquired in a friendly , though general way , after her family , and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done .	3266.6933093222797
and why not to me ?	6150.957078982863
If he fears me , why come hither ?	5829.918222414955
That will make thirteen with ourselves , so there will be just room at table for him .	3735.8759559109085
Oh !	5043.244884590713
there were half hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte , and the weather was so fine for the time of year , that she had often great enjoyment out of doors .	3199.6050458960626
Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form , he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing ;	4166.337333470028
No officer is ever to enter my house again , nor even to pass through the village .	5287.328342684032
Bennet , in short , was in very great spirits ;	4259.2249416290515
As a child I was taught what was right , but I was not taught to correct my temper .	3803.380953363266
he drew back his chair , took a newspaper from the table , and , glancing over it , said , in a colder voice , Are you pleased with Kent ?	3501.538311248879
And there are several of the young men , too , that she likes very much .	3141.2491705742236
You are then resolved to have him ?	4562.637879866111
Wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates ;	3554.8187745511427
You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I hope , though you have but a short lease .	3443.2238315087216
They met again on Sunday , and then I saw him too .	4322.862897134363
and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition .	2564.6660838220373
You will not be fit to be seen when you get there .	3358.677833741037
The period of expectation was now doubled .	6908.423134854742
Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject .	3355.525169620648
I am going away myself .	3326.240286998817
that is rather singular .	11972.90053634967
But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed ;	4418.892073365202
It was an encouragement of vice ;	4856.712754798886
Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so , said Collins very gravely but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you .	3946.968861177436
I leave it to yourself to determine , said Bennet .	3925.581033878174
Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the expression of heart-felt delight , diffused over his face , became him ;	3665.1386862451513
No .	20078.52795831342
Now , Lizzy , I think I have surprised you .	3526.0887956512165
she repeated .	16570.21737680852
Upon my word , said her Ladyship , you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person .	3870.8928172201
I certainly saw Darcy speaking to her .	3412.773872776917
He did not leave his name , and till the next day , it was only known that a gentleman had called on business .	3057.946019578915
If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other , or ever so similar before-hand , it does not advance their felicity in the least .	3532.8552987112853
I see what you are feeling , replied Charlotte , you must be surprised , very much surprised , so lately as Collins was wishing to marry you .	3064.366056175975
But are you pleased , Jane ?	7263.861240138775
do any thing rather than marry without affection .	7308.852606809045
CHAPTER XIX .	11147.934488852214
Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his countenance .	6333.193208600971
Certainly , my dear , nobody said there were ;	4799.144622219424
You know my sentiments .	6773.429810519469
that the young man's marrying her , was a patched-up business , at the expence of your father and uncles .	4174.8774348821935
In the intervals of her discourse with Collins , she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth , but especially to the latter , of whose connections she knew the least , and who she observed to Collins , was a very genteel , pretty kind of girl .	2980.6221024865567
She talked to Elizabeth again and again ;	5276.6027161292905
Miss Bennet had slept ill , and though up , was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room .	3431.436739222785
Lady Catherine it appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings , for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Darcy .	3403.223540914996
How are you all ?	9550.040525707785
How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning , Darcy , she cried ;	4359.4643674318495
I should say , one of her ladyship's carriages , for she has several .	3575.807958526608
and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time .	3959.3469724202755
How grievous then was the thought that , of a situation so desirable in every respect , so replete with advantage , so promising for happiness , Jane had been deprived , by the folly and indecorum of her own family !	3439.5684429420116
for though dilatory in undertaking business , he was quick in its execution .	4659.9061145047235
and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet .	2372.7821099386615
and if a smart young colonel , with five or six thousand a year , should want one of my girls , I shall not say nay to him ;	2823.626506124893
and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance .	3486.48179047602
I send no compliments to your mother .	4947.676720273129
I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow .	3370.890949176519
Your younger sisters must be very young ?	7703.984836757695
It was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for Longbourn , before she told her sister of Darcy's proposals .	3299.9573925774116
Collins , awkward and solemn , apologising instead of attending , and often moving wrong without being aware of it , gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give .	3646.038024662003
But , though this might be imaginary , she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy , who had been set up as a rival of Jane .	2172.4432075380323
Now , Kitty , you may cough as much as you chuse , said Bennet ;	3335.9932012569707
No , indeed .	6574.407385756011
All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over .	6756.70785980352
Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy .	5103.03232998586
and then , unwilling to let the subject drop , added , He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire , I understand .	3335.5515887446886
Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father , their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility .	4031.7672021432104
and if she would give him leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them .	3167.1420616211917
I should be sorry , you know , to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire .	2050.5513522556407
And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry ?	6124.525210291402
But it must not , shall not be .	3747.690988803083
and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park , hurried home with the great intelligence .	3954.2535432376676
After abusing you so abominably to your face , I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations .	4509.932445472894
Lizzy , said he , I was going to look for you ;	3146.73794999661
cried Elizabeth , darting from her seat as she finished the letter , in eagerness to follow him , without losing a moment of the time so precious ;	3591.9824997310934
Her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction ;	3368.8811771497335
From the farther disadvantage of Lydia's society she was of course carefully kept , and though Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her , with the promise of balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going .	3558.7666115881225
I do not at all know ;	2619.209722896771
Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield and looked in vain for Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her .	3672.0372576291984
Good Heaven !	14982.467771560046
After playing some Italian songs , Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air ;	5246.708051770531
and when I next write to her , I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account .	2988.1111109530875
Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought , said Bennet ;	3944.3751983536526
and with many men , I dare say , it succeeds .	3298.073298001588
Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency .	6688.652677043029
Will you be very angry with me , my dear Lizzy , if I take this opportunity of saying ( what I was never bold enough to say before ) how much I like him .	2794.633927292631
and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend .	3377.6860759921433
I am glad I bought my bonnet , if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox !	3376.730827816906
That the wish of giving happiness to you , might add force to the other inducements which led me on , I shall not attempt to deny .	3485.661925755763
and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment ;	3758.876923245217
but she , who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible , gaily continued , Oh !	3104.9444558891623
Surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement .	6969.886030153487
and in spite of his being a lover , Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity , to be rationally founded , because they had for basis the excellent understanding , and super-excellent disposition of Jane , and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself .	2816.065858226071
CHAPTER XXIII .	15764.050975065456
On the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband .	3868.089770834671
And who is there , whatever might be their former conduct , that she would believe capable of such an attempt , till it were proved against them ?	3586.162631104001
It was an earnest , steadfast gaze , but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind .	2940.585848092991
I will only add , God bless you .	3717.394349895453
of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance !	9189.188050066543
Wickham , perhaps , is my favourite ;	7200.107395117331
and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage , she may have less trouble in achieving a second ;	3209.318518747336
Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder , and when at last Collins allowed him time to speak , replied with an air of distant civility .	3441.6940181847226
But , my dear , your father cannot spare the horses , I am sure .	1903.3151309832165
His complexion became pale with anger , and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature .	4261.782786172971
It would be such a delicious scheme , and I dare say would hardly cost any thing at all .	2366.4721932426883
She would not give him time to reply , but hurrying instantly to her husband , called out as she entered the library , Oh !	2803.5784681020914
mamma , do the people here abouts know I am married to-day ?	7146.262265250238
She is well , and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother .	3489.9385016456704
Oh !	5043.244884590713
A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe .	4950.928090260523
Perhaps she is full young to be much in company .	6511.274375668741
I know very well that nothing can be done .	3174.762907478572
She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool ;	4569.481577030986
Bennet , how can you abuse your own children in such a way ?	3838.2621982903206
You refuse to obey the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude .	5234.963210937067
It is a circumstance which Darcy of course would not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady's family , it would be an unpleasant thing .	2705.2452471673514
but to say the truth , I was too cross to write .	4463.656657043065
that she is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference , and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him , she means ( most kindly ) to put me on my guard ?	3455.8072619819263
for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ;	3982.43399958468
You have no regard , then , for the honour and credit of my nephew !	3597.877263426181
There was no arguing upon such a project .	5754.376039962028
But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue , she could easily conjecture .	3807.3391194175892
But the person who advanced , was now near enough to see her , and stepping forward with eagerness , pronounced her name .	3071.535164686392
As she went up stairs to get ready , Bennet followed her , saying , I am quite sorry , Lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself .	2827.444296215253
He heard her with astonishment .	6041.846514715321
but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets , she soon grew too much interested in the game , too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes , to have attention for any one in particular .	3627.2373429233166
She is my youngest girl but one .	4667.125901716509
Lydia came to us ;	10741.192173591802
Every body was surprised ;	11179.44787698076
Her performance on the piano-forte is exquisite .	7376.89543192824
Elizabeth , construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister , was pleased ;	3172.0520716957158
I did hear , too , that there was a time , when sermon-making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present ;	2910.163310610305
I must find Gardiner this moment , on business that cannot be delayed ;	4261.9160119065
And with a low bow he left her to attack Darcy , whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched , and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident .	3943.694578386508
she had no conversation , no style , no taste , no beauty .	5019.758969530663
If your feelings are still what they were last April , tell me so at once .	4198.460067405318
In pompous nothings on his side , and civil assents on that of his cousins , their time passed till they entered Meryton .	3964.630754399274
and in his manner of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment , reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh , and trusting their opinion of her their opinion of every body would always coincide , there was a solicitude , an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard ;	2741.597457848214
Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case , unknown to the society of Hertfordshire ;	3555.5596196373326
Bingley and Jane were standing together , a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other .	3516.0912334402783
Does that young lady know Darcy ?	9186.209005004552
I shall not sport with your impatience , by reading what he says on that point .	3419.632866618359
But whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ;	3360.836547538039
That such a consequence as this should ensue , you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts .	4685.003744053835
Pray tell your sister that I long to see her .	4190.288231415812
A single man of large fortune ;	7631.405283001876
It was the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton , and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace .	2742.107915538574
and if they are not married already , make them marry .	3876.444153918502
and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend .	2709.726667496813
Her father captivated by youth and beauty , and that appearance of good humour , which youth and beauty generally give , had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind , had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her .	2980.103310489349
and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men .	3193.456907641766
My good , kind brother !	8231.811733490544
Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character , but said nothing .	3985.0469116876625
If my children are silly I must hope to be always sensible of it .	3289.979689637557
It was the favourite wish of his mother , as well as of her's .	3016.853087429399
How could I be so silly as to wish it !	4844.557148919137
Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you , as his father did before him ?	4631.692629969593
The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family .	4211.153218019749
In another minute Bingley , but without seeming to have noticed what passed , took leave and rode on with his friend .	3724.0124130368936
I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family .	2719.435958574854
I can readily believe , answered he gravely , that report may vary greatly with respect to me ;	3856.241767849868
Perhaps other people have said so before , but not one with such justice .	5028.011020839345
I speak feelingly .	8540.849492048597
Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth , this was not the best method of recommending herself ;	4477.415969461785
I did not know before , continued Bingley immediately , that you were a studier of character .	2603.1514531710695
Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ;	9883.41873837885
I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for I am fond of superior society ;	4075.763752832657
I always had a value for him .	3656.542737587764
You will easily comprehend , from these particulars , that Wickham's circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be .	3711.6799960833605
and Jane , who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience , from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit , was delighted at her entrance .	3418.4329030744793
My dear Friend , If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me , we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives , for a whole day's t te- -t te between two women can never end without a quarrel .	3110.4798944995814
Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife .	5938.008159444414
She is a great deal too ill to be moved .	3311.0993804658733
On distinguishing the ladies of the group , the two gentlemen came directly towards them , and began the usual civilities .	4123.552709844639
You could scarcely escape discredit and misery .	6532.331205945009
They stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece , who , astonished and confused , scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face , and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family .	3149.7843085148975
Elizabeth made no answer .	3557.347870451625
They were forced to conclude , that he had no pleasing intelligence to send , but even of that they would have been glad to be certain .	2572.6163534577386
One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight .	4600.091686067173
I do not believe a word of it , my dear .	1992.6280205407872
we must forget it ourselves .	12052.717660518261
And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman .	4375.08895319706
Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party .	5556.06855184909
What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory , and as she recalled his very words , it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other ;	3096.937757363034
They now walked on in silence ;	6342.669291548522
Jane resolutely kept her place at the table ;	7604.655836498229
then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms .	6118.786888730221
Are you going much farther ?	9359.612894369435
I have met with two instances lately ;	4609.429458310906
I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy .	2811.172121484722
for I dare not hope , he continued in a lower and more serious tone , that he is improved in essentials .	3487.210363591635
Do you often dance at James's ?	7471.554093067084
In anticipating the happiness of Bingley , which of course was to be inferior only to his own , he continued the conversation till they reached the house .	2916.319186470992
Indeed , Bennet , said she , it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that I should be forced to make way for her , and live to see her take my place in it !	2188.885662587001
And Mary King is safe !	8602.018408895388
Jane ran to her uncle and aunt , and welcomed and thanked them both , with alternate smiles and tears .	3563.0063981370195
By all means , cried Bingley ;	7074.554372272269
After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence , health , good humour and cheerfulness began to re-appear at Longbourn .	4208.355588961857
and Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again , whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them .	3342.869477710444
Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off .	5667.989463318022
if he were so , they could not succeed .	6982.222017203927
her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances , and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else Darcy was condemned as the worst of men .	4479.30299355387
In a few days Bingley returned Bennet's visit , and sat about ten minutes with him in his library .	3473.030371256082
and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister , and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them .	2509.9766664731046
Besides , there was truth in his looks .	8077.881509053001
but at any rate , was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal .	4656.568453687674
were questions with which she amused herself .	7923.432343410428
I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind .	3732.879507731585
But , however , he is very welcome to come to Netherfield , if he likes it .	2116.829356675266
A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty ;	3717.6584123384364
But Gardiner , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in her hopes as her fears ;	3260.1501590641687
She then hastened away to her mother , who had purposely broken up the card party , and was sitting up stairs with Kitty .	2838.156562017437
and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Denny , to whom Lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned ;	2714.566856924757
but to her own more extensive information , he was the person , to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as what Jane felt for Bingley .	2923.618289990398
What would I give to hear your strictures on them !	5955.855777235695
Lizzy , said he , what are you doing ?	3915.4209265927866
You will find her manners beyond any thing I can describe ;	4891.069625595416
I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had .	4409.829825447019
What an agreeable man Sir William is , Bingley is not he ?	5611.265707370911
I always said it must be so , at last .	3515.7518262595813
People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking .	5572.329890838643
Though Lydia had never been a favourite with them , and Gardiner could not but be deeply affected .	3800.564478716434
But so they always are .	6554.117460542279
But to be sure , the good lady who shewed us the house , did give him a most flaming character !	3361.248275317488
He was most highly esteemed by Darcy , a most intimate , confidential friend .	3655.4066644859754
Not to appear to disgrace his family , to degenerate from the popular qualities , or lose the influence of the Pemberley House , is a powerful motive .	4171.167425025454
It is too long ago .	4318.931202850244
No , my dear ;	5185.598142752052
Annesley is with her .	8205.290852193759
Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they admired her and liked her , and pronounced her to be a sweet girl , and one whom they should not object to know more of .	2795.24679738513
but since he had been in the militia , it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them .	2411.721559877064
I do not believe Long will do any such thing .	2715.2545592456236
Ten thousand a year !	10320.008943566814
but allow me to assure you that I have your respected mother's permission for this address .	3803.5033572127395
Darcy sends you all the love in the world , that he can spare from me .	3027.5701618463104
Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk , they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance , and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance .	3340.4153689405025
Yes ;	10872.67006892519
Is not he a charming man ?	8069.624242001106
Oh , Lizzy !	6221.833824633635
I came to try you .	4714.730164743886
Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes .	4799.486081443277
His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same , said Elizabeth angrily ;	4019.284222111414
which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption , she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister , had been formed before he quitted the inn , and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there , had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend .	3341.113825277731
You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing .	4707.191262236535
We shall be at Newcastle all the winter , and I dare say there will be some balls , and I will take care to get good partners for them all .	2498.236224205759
They have known her much longer than they have known me ;	5071.871525586662
What say you , Mary ?	8893.099021189439
and Charlotte , detained first by the civility of Collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear .	3224.3648321765186
She was at least free from the offence of Darcy's farther notice ;	4291.101506796597
and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close ;	4021.7424561426064
Read it aloud , said their father , for I hardly know myself what it is about .	4693.565928906859
But really , Ma'am , I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters , that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early .	2944.985387300437
The present always occupies you in such scenes does it ?	4916.45241855231
You do not look well .	5135.328952821854
Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this , but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head .	3202.4465163170657
You are severe on us .	4667.986966433446
and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me , because you have always so much .	3415.027060488165
Very true , my dear , that is exactly what I say .	3282.615808077447
Collins was punctual to his time , and was received with great politeness by the whole family .	3137.473606366205
One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man , with family , fortune , every thing in his favour , should think highly of himself .	3440.5285123009735
and if you persist in indifference , do not make me your confidante .	3296.9402318645784
and when occasionally , unable to resist the impulse of curiosity , she raised her eyes to his face , she as often found him looking at Jane , as at herself , and frequently on no object but the ground .	3205.294362367897
My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this .	4890.03656459668
Elizabeth longed to explore its windings ;	7034.383337269194
and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of , she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours .	3312.949000404549
You are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room , said Darcy , looking at the eldest Miss Bennet .	2642.088988759615
But you are always giving her the preference .	5436.543512818529
I am confident that she would have performed delightfully .	3278.937486585997
You shall not defend her , though it is Charlotte Lucas .	4556.268610549046
Darcy is impatient to see his sister , and to confess the truth , we are scarcely less eager to meet her again .	3058.8109334507644
After this period , every appearance of acquaintance was dropt .	6480.974910428185
As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not , she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind .	3620.8754760452957
how I wanted you !	9585.943293978522
She wrote again when the visit was paid , and she had seen Miss Bingley .	2889.460776745866
This cannot be !	11387.737302913372
What think you of books ?	8116.8006970536135
But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them .	3940.2360810466043
And yours , he replied with a smile , is wilfully to misunderstand them .	3688.0381304338403
His accompanying them was a double advantage ;	7746.091028099117
and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness .	3475.542451751547
On such encouragement to ask , Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away .	3526.5523160993016
While these newly-born notions were passing in their heads , the perturbation of Elizabeth's feelings was every moment increasing .	5401.399255944793
This letter is from Collins .	8159.2396110029495
Darcy , on the contrary , had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion , for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest , and from none received either attention or pleasure .	3244.125958663879
but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas .	3632.1546661490497
his society was irksome , and his attachment to her must be imaginary .	5129.91085279835
It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ;	3624.2561857887895
Bingley replied that he did , and made his congratulations .	5141.785627664335
Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at Brighton .	4707.288175053455
But that gentleman , looking at Darcy , seemed to think the country was nothing at all .	3002.819293065977
An airing would do me a great deal of good , I am sure .	2636.3295119744885
Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew ;	4384.371439388956
and on her pausing , he asked her , if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends .	3050.708769148447
and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her , the worth of each was eclipsed by Bingley and Netherfield .	3165.8348327794743
No , nothing at all .	3642.6594659600078
The turn of your countenance I shall never forget , as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way , that would induce you to accept me .	3131.8577035195626
Yes , almost every day .	4468.048857432116
but Bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished , was excessively disappointed .	3782.2111776658026
I desire you will stay where you are .	4371.096236692977
though their kindness to Jane , such as it was , had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration .	3644.1622171279173
How could his will be disregarded ?	7375.1774409833515
Collins readily assented , and a book was produced ;	6060.921619766239
Darcy corroborated it with a bow , and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth , when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger , and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other , was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting .	2953.5835261009956
It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now .	3756.11339338169
She dared not relate the other half of Darcy's letter , nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend .	3179.073649676248
On entering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo , and was immediately invited to join them ;	3689.274650817299
Lydia , my love , though you are the youngest , I dare say Bingley will dance with you at the next ball .	3243.1283801642257
The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth .	6219.75099125771
She was sorry that Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them ;	3408.69396095231
The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , cake , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ;	3469.272014142196
She had always seen it with pain ;	4624.835401462783
I cannot do justice to his kindness .	4021.7884322983955
Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party .	4603.155278131006
Your conjecture is totally wrong , I assure you .	3934.2708622569617
and Lydia , self-willed and careless , would scarcely give them a hearing .	4464.2338197092795
Hurst looked at her with astonishment .	6845.77772354708
As soon as ever Bingley comes , my dear , said Bennet , you will wait on him of course .	2327.6811619290875
Indeed I do not dare .	6802.495808114797
But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence .	6065.676139911821
But she is perfectly amiable , and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies .	4044.2020733070844
and she thought , more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire , than as she had seen him at Pemberley .	2036.8764566923085
to Miss Lydia Bennet , ' without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or any thing .	3558.0432207454705
but satisfying them instantly on that head , she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons , reading the two letters aloud , and dwelling on the postscript of the last , with trembling energy .	3786.596531354368
I should like balls infinitely better , she replied , if they were carried on in a different manner ;	3443.0706707890427
and as Miss Bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to Wickham , Georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more .	2711.2683039196368
He can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear .	3769.237181804485
There was too much to be thought ;	5034.3228146718075
and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind , wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite .	3833.8947980778858
What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant ?	6049.137824465965
But my dearest love , tell me what dish Darcy is particularly fond of , that I may have it to-morrow .	3824.3897178770276
My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect .	5119.259870838095
I dare say I shall soon see them here .	3581.0069894442427
While the family were in this confusion , Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them .	4192.6101560032885
and in the nearness of the Parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lived in it , the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day .	2826.789356600013
while his sisters , convinced that no country advice could be of any service , recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians .	4388.2256586531785
She was overpowered by shame and vexation .	4177.515818052468
Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town ;	4615.372354377996
there is nothing in that .	7542.541490771373
Why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ?	3784.582478524046
Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow , and though she could not hear a word of it , she felt as if hearing it all , and saw in the motion of his lips the words apology , Hunsford , and Lady Catherine de Bourgh .	2639.8403961020417
and when the subject was revived the next morning , and she was again applied to , could readily answer , and with a proper air of indifference , that she had not really any dislike to the scheme .	2278.1551986139234
and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints , they parted ;	3579.3749647491036
For God's sake , say no more of his partners .	6185.029271277291
Whatever he said , was said well ;	7132.053710790961
They are gone off together from Brighton .	5434.910549511719
He knows of my being in town , I am certain , from something she said herself ;	2942.503033681244
He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant .	5488.993843756014
The prospect of such delights was very cheering , and they parted in mutual good spirits .	3988.2366786152593
she still expected that it would all end well , and that every morning would bring some letter , either from Lydia or her father , to explain their proceedings , and perhaps announce the marriage .	3442.2700978151333
Perhaps he had been civil , only because he felt himself at ease ;	4874.394193721492
and indeed I am quite of your opinion .	4608.885470519201
he will rant and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter .	3420.863672568631
Lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in Bingley's way .	2963.1958131088923
You may remember what I told you on that point , when first we talked of it .	3008.487234716749
And they must marry !	8704.19388727144
Consider how important every moment is , in such a case .	5733.770098686014
From something that he told me in our journey hither , I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him .	3483.972950799116
Indeed , Collins , all praise of me will be unnecessary .	5902.0318821091905
I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well , when she came into the room this morning .	3211.6494769919695
My conduct may I fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own .	4401.227808942993
his style was not penitent , but haughty .	8499.63033262598
And even Mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it .	3275.7919111727206
and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it .	2771.198228597574
Though she dared not depend upon the consequence , she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour .	5275.202190738703
On being made acquainted with the present Darcy's treatment of him , she tried to remember something of that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad , which might agree with it , and was confident at last , that she recollected having heard Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud , ill-natured boy .	3076.645586047534
To all the objections I have already urged , I have still another to add .	4538.789317209724
There was another reason too for her opposition .	5889.67274026649
for she only came , I suppose , to tell us the Collinses were well .	3585.879878771446
I am only resolved to act in that manner , which will , in my own opinion , constitute my happiness , without reference to you , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me .	2873.2726760358705
'Ah !	40535.86118978839
She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved .	5397.654483584561
He has also brotherly pride , which with some brotherly affection , makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister ;	3815.1319494994323
but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them ;	3017.6466295301248
It was generally evident whenever they met , that he did admire her ;	2915.0156081537575
as we went along , Kitty and me drew up all the blinds , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ;	5138.500997742235
I am talking of possibilities , Charles .	4476.680024290923
because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth .	5981.529460952439
Mama , cried Lydia , my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they first came ;	4675.52770131714
You have said quite enough , madam .	5816.318816612485
Brighton , and a whole campful of soldiers , to us , who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia , and the monthly balls of Meryton .	3835.392491712908
He readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for her distress , wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope , and leaving his compliments for her relations , with only one serious , parting , look , went away .	3567.3551145642814
and unwilling for her sister's sake , to provoke him , she only said in reply , with a good-humoured smile , Come , Wickham , we are brother and sister , you know .	2902.618603002693
As he spoke there was a sort of smile , which Elizabeth fancied she understood ;	4318.123456630383
E below .	22421.855171372856
And she rose as she spoke .	6966.540214656002
Well !	23449.52604746506
There is nothing else to be done .	3482.7807546141175
His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece ;	5259.660472985069
But she had never felt so strongly as now , the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage , nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents ;	3553.0985407711955
I thought too ill of him , to invite him to Pemberley , or admit his society in town .	3063.892864497351
But while he was mortal , there must be a triumph .	4541.521582406783
I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest , there is no occasion for any thing more .	2837.2026400464233
It is a great comfort to have you so rich , and when you have nothing else to do , I hope you will think of us .	2097.6037649386262
Do not distress me by the idea .	5889.036581798317
Nothing is more deceitful , said Darcy , than the appearance of humility .	4534.220941478738
Jane was not deceived , but she was affected ;	4686.562787561591
and if you lament over him much longer , my heart will be as light as a feather .	3690.212014033419
It is a pity they are not handsome !	3569.2458440266014
what is it about ?	12559.810081769012
But Jane and Elizabeth , who agreed in wishing , for the sake of their sister's feelings and consequence , that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents , urged him so earnestly , yet so rationally and so mildly , to receive her and her husband at Longbourn , as soon as they were married , that he was prevailed on to think as they thought , and act as they wished .	2446.7557821172873
Her face is too thin ;	9099.731616821155
Their visits to Philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence .	5529.345973341067
of what are you thinking ?	11397.820409911355
It was in the Times and the Courier , I know ;	3686.212548488196
and fourthly , that the match might be broken off .	4401.081342246549
She felt that Jane's feelings , though fervent , were little displayed , and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner , not often united with great sensibility .	3095.820090683432
I must not decide on my own performance .	5002.234376887141
Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible ;	2933.144010248683
but when Philips understood from him what Rosings was , and who was its proprietor , when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms , and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all the force of the compliment , and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper's room .	2900.527948875253
There is nothing the matter with me .	3449.8024405686633
And as to laughter , we will not expose ourselves , if you please , by attempting to laugh without a subject .	3780.644667420285
Here again I shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell .	5792.65162576337
Well , Colonel Fitzwilliam , what do I play next ?	4863.3185929139
Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp , and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table , and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley's .	3404.818472156876
He shall be mercenary , and she shall be foolish .	4614.453908796285
They were all of them warm in their admiration ;	4958.797718094474
These recollections will not do at all .	5329.655208604358
secondly , she was very sure that Collins had been taken in ;	5311.713447373374
The garden sloping to the road , the house standing in it , the green pales and the laurel hedge , every thing declared they were arriving .	3858.707332298158
Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption , while the servants remained .	5299.350293599596
Human nature is so prone to fall into it !	8046.408057317364
Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions , all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US unless a copyright notice is included .	4883.924365200901
Never mind Miss Lizzy's hair .	11847.093429677343
Wickham will soon be gone ;	9057.120780567773
but , stopping on his approach , received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome .	4336.625576485979
Oh !	5043.244884590713
Had Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle , she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself ;	3544.4171625206163
Collins was also in the same state of angry pride .	4989.871469988045
Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered .	5805.225713966619
The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon , and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her that she was not enough recovered ;	2746.4364418666664
and I find that the young man forgot to tell you , among his other communications , that he was the son of old Wickham , the late Darcy's steward .	2779.638368207716
But nothing can be done ;	6303.36920243582
but Elizabeth , to satisfy her mother , went to the window she looked , she saw Darcy with him , and sat down again by her sister .	2363.546344130866
He then sat down by her , and talked scarcely to any one else .	3045.270845103952
Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject .	6607.012104940117
How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day !	5318.148024004494
and if she might judge from his complexion , his mind was not very differently engaged .	3615.654980451977
I have not been accustomed to such language as this .	2811.9691276592876
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection .	4825.744428665301
It was rather small , but well built and convenient ;	4650.012985577342
but Bennet was firm : it soon led to another ;	5590.494623024668
Next time you call , said she , I hope we shall be more lucky .	3473.1517857259037
CHAPTER X Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter , as soon as she possibly could .	3095.6699299510587
This preservative she had now obtained ;	8228.702530877883
Every thing , however , went on smoothly , and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch .	3864.5245043165974
I was uncomfortable enough .	4458.256117431495
Gardiner , who was several years younger than Bennet and Philips , was an amiable , intelligent , elegant woman , and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces .	3617.2106428419693
Yes ;	10872.67006892519
Undoubtedly .	37379.511870440976
Darcy smiled and said , You are perfectly right .	4622.5887490325995
I wish I could call her amiable .	4039.672824405683
He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere , if not with equal regard .	4003.661023392857
but it is wholly out of my power .	4376.917329179804
There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter , which promises well .	3458.939717454029
This idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view ;	5751.532094808969
it must be my uncle's doings !	7515.7564239523845
Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother , on her ladyship's entrance , though no request of introduction had been made .	3528.951623409693
He was fond of the country and of books ;	4623.349418477717
and in her postscript it was added , that if Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer , she could spare them very well .	2935.9035357382068
How so ?	12737.831041172856
He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment , on account of some debts of honour , which were very pressing ;	4203.760524007615
They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation ;	5210.668893341155
Bingley was the principal spokesman , and Miss Bennet the principal object .	4509.492720434635
She blushed at the very idea ;	6814.831959255702
He is indeed but considering the inducement , my dear Miss Eliza , we cannot wonder at his complaisance ;	3266.2215781483183
When they were all in the drawing-room , the questions which Elizabeth had already asked , were of course repeated by the others , and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give .	3069.9726459838757
But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour ;	6000.562547284084
I should imagine not .	4561.218357605071
Darcy , you see , is the man !	4976.970729268978
Probably not ;	22422.391444549674
there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home , how she would like Lady Catherine , and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be ;	3343.6305948170293
You may as well call it impertinence at once .	4062.73842357375
Away ran the girls , too eager to get in to have time for speech .	6142.772571193025
The insipidity and yet the noise ;	7395.157227994314
and from this time Bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them .	3522.0115129036035
and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again .	3583.4097483388186
and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world , he was caught by their easy playfulness .	3047.7666211220735
Darcy , as well as Elizabeth , really loved them ;	3362.612768366736
It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends .	3147.876362787782
She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas , who often joined them , and good-naturedly engaged Collins's conversation to herself .	3297.9174448896515
In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health , imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better .	3920.04523301695
Jane was distressed .	9009.641907880836
My kind friends will not hear of my returning home till I am better .	4695.469367445419
what news ?	17150.233998220378
for the curiosity excited by his long absence , burst forth in such very direct questions on his return , as required some ingenuity to evade , and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial , for he was longing to publish his prosperous love .	3116.984207123851
She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened ;	3929.4270449834253
She will not be able to help calling .	3556.8284359715426
His character sunk on every review of it ;	4346.683896452431
said he ;	13772.837131708262
Eliza Bennet , said Miss Bingley , when the door was closed on her , is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex , by undervaluing their own ;	3064.8595646519398
On both sides it was only assertion .	7956.754054989499
though perhaps it was lucky for her husband , who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form , that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly .	3895.2795578352943
Their society can afford no pleasure , that will atone for such wretchedness as this !	5408.800202205822
Let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied .	5634.10963018494
no .	24666.23778757897
He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood ;	4930.156620356445
We seem to have been designed for each other .	3971.275008216588
I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your's .	3557.6219649614086
Where is your sister ?	12558.461539379492
I did for you .	3739.47872346019
Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand ;	4729.533112259993
and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months .	4804.233701891402
Easter was approaching , and the week preceding it , was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings , which in so small a circle must be important .	3782.3225563368956
There was certainly at this moment , in Elizabeth's mind , a more gentle sensation towards the original , than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance .	3349.1636928669614
As he quitted the room , Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire ;	3589.78340451025
indeed , you must have seen it in the papers .	5868.234482569395
I can answer your question , said Fitzwilliam , without applying to him .	3140.8428443860635
In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother , though expressed most concisely , he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done , and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him .	3099.972768855318
nor could she for a moment repent her refusal , or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again .	3871.717467823051
And so saying , he turned back with them , and walked towards the house .	3029.045782611495
How can they suit each other ?	7283.522873221622
Oh !	5043.244884590713
Can he be a sensible man , sir ?	6503.2294704416945
Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room , to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself .	3762.148322296026
But , my dear Elizabeth , she added , what sort of girl is Miss King ?	2491.4232139587502
But , however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination , I do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage , had it not been seconded by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving , of your sister's indifference .	3126.144945121668
Do not wish me such an evil .	6334.171042237637
But there was much to be talked of , in marrying her ;	3720.1111661800865
He begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother ;	4674.395600379152
At length , quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book , which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his , she gave a great yawn and said , How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way !	3310.138217977712
To Caroline's assertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit .	4781.9107049094655
and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt , than to run such a risk .	3552.6186772424057
I rather wished , than believed him to be sincere ;	4305.636458274485
He heard her attentively , and then said , Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances .	3249.4411708185385
Elizabeth could bear it no longer .	5023.557864663715
I assure you , that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it .	1925.0073178252414
Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual .	9483.885818287303
If they had uncles enough to fill all Cheapside , cried Bingley , it would not make them one jot less agreeable .	3708.6199054483327
Both , replied Elizabeth archly ;	10015.836919150777
You have now done your duty by her , and must fret no longer .	3351.1942977256
but if she is really headstrong and foolish , I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state .	3520.0775007819075
Elizabeth , equally next to Jane in birth and beauty , succeeded her of course .	4148.361695156785
and the gown which had been let down to hide it , not doing its office .	3876.8134585806597
Let me be rightly understood .	7888.976494931387
Because honour , decorum , prudence , nay , interest , forbid it .	5260.078064673737
and she seized the opportunity of saying , Is your sister at Pemberley still ?	3536.3593848211162
on Tuesday , his wife received a letter from him ;	5029.4266480162305
It was acknowledged , however , that he was a liberal man , and did much good among the poor .	2249.245935829008
The first wish of my heart , said she to herself , is never more to be in company with either of them .	2521.324623300392
in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and I dare say it would succeed , if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way .	2950.3387326379743
Darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence .	7318.287583263503
she had seen enough of Bingley's behaviour to Jane , to be convinced that she would get him at last ;	3197.4947778307505
About the Court , such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon .	6828.262684529762
I have not an instant to lose .	3723.6623041878424
Don't think me angry , however , for I only mean to let you know , that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side .	3070.3389759739166
Bennet was quite disconcerted .	7965.195984852418
A lively imagination soon settled it all .	5617.150728977009
E7 and any additional terms imposed by the copyright holder .	7465.41741840089
He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem .	4069.286736669246
When my eyes were opened to his real character .	5200.884388001121
Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged , by the scarcity of gentlemen , to sit down for two dances ;	4164.209267306976
How strange this is !	9211.397958114776
what felicity !	20594.3781954568
I should be glad to take a turn in it , if you will favour me with your company .	2698.9958502951126
and I was convinced of her affection .	3935.962595843844
Her home and her housekeeping , her parish and her poultry , and all their dependent concerns , had not yet lost their charms .	3956.608618765325
and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls ;	3509.4607184005354
They soon outstripped the others , and when they had reached the carriage , and Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind .	3237.2625414005524
But if he returns no more this winter , my choice will never be required .	4270.770269098815
Your first position is false .	9475.087549387932
and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him .	2928.043661001582
Five daughters brought up at home without a governess !	7974.802675764788
What does Darcy mean , said she to Charlotte , by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster ?	4160.454105962134
There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men .	5148.184078492249
I will go directly to Bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , I am sure .	1964.6359347916798
She smiled , but made no answer .	4156.079322540815
As to his real character , had information been in her power , she had never felt a wish of enquiring .	3377.606522758038
Darcy was delighted with their engagement ;	7160.367900824833
Bingley had danced with her twice , and she had been distinguished by his sisters .	3168.772539329944
But if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal it , he must find it out .	3081.5157023123465
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged , every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him .	4001.709520243237
- You provide , in accordance with paragraph 1 .	5294.204668432821
and , as he had likewise foretold , he took his seat at the bottom of the table , by her ladyship's desire , and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater .	3063.2173392113955
A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her , a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude , and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter .	3596.237464804919
Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile , but Elizabeth could not return it .	3229.829694120925
It would have been strange if they had .	3989.807296672817
every thing must sink under such a proof of family weakness , such an assurance of the deepest disgrace .	5025.531952975037
She has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject , to give greater what shall I call it ?	2817.960684968174
and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance , especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again .	3268.897104793615
When the ladies returned to the drawing-room , there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk , which she did without any intermission till coffee came in , delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted .	2963.9422182680896
And her neighbours at Lucas lodge , therefore , ( for through their communication with the Collinses , the report she concluded had reached lady Catherine ) had only set that down , as almost certain and immediate , which she had looked forward to as possible , at some future time .	3197.9365518495974
I really cannot laugh at it .	4182.178861460634
The Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan S Fairbanks , AK , 99712 .	4854.413989356204
the door was thrown open , and she ran into the room .	2841.06406868267
Perhaps this concealment , this disguise , was beneath me .	5649.024059371995
Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion , and complimented her on bearing it so well .	4932.018630816491
But , my dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me obstinate if I still assert , that , considering what her behaviour was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion .	2906.796891507479
Do you suppose them to be in London ?	4799.7467992771635
Once or twice she could discern a faint blush ;	8959.33369313873
But , however , that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here , I am determined .	2499.198871898021
But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into , was shortly relieved , and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope , by an article of news , which then began to be in circulation .	3494.6633854444003
Can I speak plainer ?	12271.526661479364
Some time or other he will be but it shall not be by me .	4435.060210940028
As they went down stairs together , Charlotte said , I shall depend on hearing from you very often , Eliza .	3934.463117957751
I have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse .	4340.623691648051
By nature inoffensive , friendly and obliging , his presentation at James's had made him courteous .	5456.676406808199
he had looked at her without admiration at the ball ;	5259.697418616916
But , in my opinion , it is a paltry device , a very mean art .	3229.96778959408
His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear .	5880.22364330748
She must own that she was tired of great houses ;	4877.688884085948
But if it be only a slight , thin sort of inclination , I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away .	3098.9925443994
Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us , which becomes herself and daughter .	4032.5959671007035
Laugh as much as you chuse , but you will not laugh me out of my opinion .	3977.6495036489473
What do I not owe you !	6242.250172815276
Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies ;	5160.4120942731115
There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire .	4467.854416913068
It is excellent news , capital news , and about a certain person that we all like .	3907.4487439717386
you sly thing !	16644.788644448254
On Miss Lucas's persevering , however , she added , Very well ;	3140.0056628852494
I found , said he , as the time drew near , that I had better not meet Darcy ;	2311.2659336701004
She then read the first sentence aloud , which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly , and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street , where Hurst had a house .	3493.397538322371
but his father's uncommon attachment to me , irritated him I believe very early in life .	3585.895751979197
Elizabeth hoped she had silenced him ;	5939.809572792181
You want to tell me , and I have no objection to hearing it .	2508.659603862705
Amongst the most violent against him was Bennet , whose dislike of his general behaviour , was sharpened into particular resentment , by his having slighted one of her daughters .	4217.6189783075315
Yes , Ma'am , that he was indeed ;	3107.503049449314
In consequence of an agreement between the sisters , Elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother , to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day .	2753.6155509767323
With his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous , contained much good sense and solid reasoning .	4466.968771829202
Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education , and who has lived in the world , is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers ?	3692.7108754627557
On Sunday , after morning service , the separation , so agreeable to almost all , took place .	4975.064428986404
As a brother , a landlord , a master , she considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship !	4590.96712732635
You shall have it in few words .	6135.248727760736
I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden , and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter !	3576.2721254996904
In such an exigence my uncle's advice and assistance would be every thing in the world ;	3636.539211511682
So much the better .	7156.920982532779
And tell my dear Lydia , not to give any directions about her clothes , till she has seen me , for she does not know which are the best warehouses .	3449.9366846728826
On Saturday he came again .	6921.997678582053
but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way , and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow evening .	3517.4897242264437
Yet in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin Elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may incur , by a precipitate closure with this gentleman's proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of .	3133.3162116944427
it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Bingley's being there ;	3139.919938580323
There is a gentleman with him , mamma , said Kitty ;	3810.2753339379938
The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her .	3495.634127984914
After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event , which Elizabeth considered as all but certain , and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible ;	4142.452779716289
Lydia the humiliation , the misery , she was bringing on them all , soon swallowed up every private care ;	4529.249400583168
Go , my dear , cried her mother , and shew her ladyship about the different walks .	3617.8403533598885
Lady Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes , and consideration for his comfort , appeared very remarkable .	4164.841159015116
it remains to be told why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where I assure you there are many amiable young women .	3919.6621716931622
and he afterwards took occasion to ask her , when unattended to by any of the rest , whether all her sisters were at Longbourn .	3100.4897403540645
But I was embarrassed .	5432.33837873021
A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern .	6107.95120877578
It cannot be done too much ;	6105.620780245129
Elizabeth , with a triumphant sensation , looked towards his friend .	3087.0317422134713
Are you out of your senses , to be accepting this man ?	5008.620035930938
Oh !	5043.244884590713
So much the better .	7156.920982532779
Oh !	5043.244884590713
Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint ;	5093.2537512500885
But he is a liberal master , I suppose , and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue .	2923.5110848817267
I shall see her in January .	4936.961735610292
and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married .	3837.1825049408108
He has a very satirical eye , and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself , I shall soon grow afraid of him .	2320.49200642507
Elizabeth , who knew this to be levelled at Darcy , was in such misery of shame , that she could hardly keep her seat .	2863.245428013013
how I should like to be married before any of you ;	4733.511943736874
It must be his own doing .	5474.363698983019
Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment , and then replied , The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind .	3427.9319756103496
Bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Darcy ;	3706.2434665767755
and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress ;	3972.6218919474363
They then went away .	5630.679527715349
Their reception at home was most kind .	6905.57766872692
There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again ;	4612.362851883453
Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast , and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before .	2985.4186102020526
I must speak to Hill , this moment .	4095.322378669384
But I know the foundation is unjust .	5177.984627881039
It was absolutely necessary , therefore , to think of something , and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in Hertfordshire , and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure , she observed , How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November , Darcy !	2444.602522108638
Darcy is not to be laughed at !	5138.8727966291
The party did not supply much conversation .	5875.76523782563
But do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us ?	3513.888737587206
Having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and from her age and disposition , greater steadiness than first attachments often boast ;	4194.792591721427
Pleased with the preference of one , and offended by the neglect of the other , on the very beginning of our acquaintance , I have courted prepossession and ignorance , and driven reason away , where either were concerned .	3597.7231239967577
When alone with Elizabeth afterwards , she spoke more on the subject .	4087.6025310478567
Never , since reading Jane's second letter , had she entertained a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her .	4176.099080862574
gave her hand with an affectionate smile to Wickham , who followed his lady , and wished them both joy , with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness .	3924.667536719444
and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ;	3488.420777876477
We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect .	4480.322970192106
and , therefore , I am not afraid of speaking openly .	1945.5140662939295
He then shut the door , and coming up to her , claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister .	3280.371890567542
and it might strike them that they could be more economically , though less expeditiously , married in London , than in Scotland .	3638.2111756288314
Is it not clear enough ?	9879.174518648522
and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes ;	3105.6568378200495
His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case , but his reliance on mine , made every thing easy .	4087.4410569164347
She looked at his two sisters , and saw them making signs of derision at each other , and at Darcy , who continued however impenetrably grave .	2807.9268861582304
and , after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table , they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper , who attended , in the absence of her daughters .	2886.07553268479
He was very fond of them .	3014.0897717188072
And you may be certain that when I have the honour of seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualifications .	3236.161856838077
She was not rendered formidable by silence ;	4209.411277053555
It was , on the contrary , exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes ;	2977.594812575243
Do you really think so ?	6882.127830117015
I owe all that I know of it , to another , not to you .	2990.8674595494394
CHAPTER XV .	11147.934488852214
A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little .	6997.449013040477
but she was flattered and pleased .	4467.047009017001
She attracted him more than he liked and Miss Bingley was uncivil to her , and more teazing than usual to himself .	2712.202969390886
And what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her ?	3985.9428489866195
Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness , openness , ductility of his temper , though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own , and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied .	3518.481444562
In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable , and Jane to make her resigned .	3868.6184846496544
But perhaps Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle .	3369.698907469141
Very true , indeed ;	9329.193557440758
Her performance was pleasing , though by no means capital .	5110.42655186556
What are we to do !	7864.702038859194
I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner .	4275.896036210417
and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark .	4160.911765865508
and when Wickham walked into the room , Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before , nor thinking of him since , with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration .	2773.66029273871
Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy , drawn when she was only eight years old .	4389.348769378234
Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail .	4885.417797497288
what it contains , has surprised me a good deal .	6493.8977183079705
it will then be early enough for expectation .	6768.014302010756
I will try again .	3970.4571180243474
He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire .	4112.346752735013
If I wished to think slightingly of any body's children , it should not be of my own however .	4026.2055505592607
There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings !	5426.667318077163
His choice is disinterested at least , for he must know my father can give her nothing .	4616.993148513918
This is an evening of wonders , indeed !	5715.211454593443
1 .	9967.378404281952
If he had been wavering before , as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy , as dignity unblemished could make him .	3048.4686543872035
it was not their wish to force her communication .	4563.66696126525
You wish to think all the world respectable , and are hurt if I speak ill of any body .	3920.4242076355213
F2 .	40535.86118978839
He was received by Bennet with a degree of civility , which made her two daughters ashamed , especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend .	3263.208419562398
That is the place to get husbands .	5869.070602625902
Sir , you quite misunderstand me , said Bennet , alarmed .	4918.1516687293315
engaged to Darcy !	15765.996596872834
How far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs , I cannot tell ;	4784.050389350954
and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown .	5260.840378497418
only think !	23990.586802499183
But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley .	3554.5959868611026
and then you may say whatever you like of me .	3440.6709994261555
Gardiner was standing a little behind ;	8522.238366385343
His behaviour to her sister was such , during dinner time , as shewed an admiration of her , which , though more guarded than formerly , persuaded Elizabeth , that if left wholly to himself , Jane's happiness , and his own , would be speedily secured .	2805.633056709196
He paused in hopes of an answer ;	5671.837558024295
but I hope this may be false .	4704.475834654878
But I think Darcy improves on acquaintance .	4367.939627291015
Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , reflecting on what she had heard , and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it , when Sir William Lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family .	2788.94293847372
It is a rule with me , that a person who can write a long letter , with ease , cannot write ill .	3130.112635986918
I know little of the game , at present , said he , but I shall be glad to improve myself , for in my situation of life Philips was very thankful for his compliance , but could not wait for his reason .	2762.109850340205
For such an attachment as this , she might have sufficient charms ;	4647.644851691457
On the strength of Darcy's regard Bingley had the firmest reliance , and of his judgment the highest opinion .	3737.878216510022
With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Bingley and talked of Darcy may be guessed .	5624.0942777451555
He walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind ;	3290.1402583733925
I am not going to run away , Papa , said Kitty , fretfully ;	3115.333413022225
Her not objecting , does not justify him .	4922.239598953521
I am sorry to pain you but so it was .	2748.870598738273
Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in undiminished beauty ;	7112.424058763872
for Lady Catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men .	2854.8015408780557
She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place , and accordingly began by observing , that his arrival had been very unexpected for your housekeeper , she added , informed us that you would certainly not be here till to-morrow ;	2689.511940957166
Oh !	5043.244884590713
there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded , and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time .	3484.199165874473
He looked surprised , displeased , alarmed ;	6744.252353758712
In a moment they were all out of the chaise , rejoicing at the sight of each other .	2991.4348167776507
I wish this may be more intelligible , but though not confined for time , my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent .	3858.277165395937
and on the part of Bennet and Kitty , though she was perfectly unknown to them , even inferior to what Elizabeth felt .	3126.767688570507
Eager to be alone , and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt , she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley , and then hurried away to dress .	3302.5238169163226
His countenance , voice , and manner , had established him at once in the possession of every virtue .	4724.570556638137
He assured her that as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ;	3657.690869523656
Already arisen !	26925.301185366065
an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope , that by the following Christmas , she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day , unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war-office , another regiment should be quartered in Meryton .	3763.9048194751513
Ah !	25580.072097342923
On the evening before my going to London , said he I made a confession to him , which I believe I ought to have made long ago .	2714.41336461521
As they passed into other rooms , these objects were taking different positions ;	5394.927850693446
The path just admitted three .	8039.290943468276
her's lasted a little longer ;	11764.852834631178
Do not let us quarrel about the past .	6286.865246570951
He was a tall , heavy looking young man of five and twenty .	3843.0162529377576
Elizabeth was not comfortable ;	5989.557604740803
But I dare not hope it .	3221.352871748684
The strangeness of Collins's making two offers of marriage within three days , was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted .	3836.975929855884
and if you are not kind to us , brother , I do not know what we shall do .	2068.5926550008344
Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports , by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under .	4387.86123857433
but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship , I suspect his gratitude misleads him , and that in spite of her being his patroness , she is an arrogant , conceited woman .	2855.5309415368747
But it is of small importance .	4583.24607118202
Your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct , I am sure .	3350.6372155157856
I [ Illustration : A VICARAGE HOUSE .	6003.967240648269
E7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1 .	3686.3486324902365
Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself ;	3817.336662168551
I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one .	2654.5230657684583
By all that I have ever read , I am convinced that it is very common indeed , that human nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other , real or imaginary .	2714.4026246567487
At night she opened her heart to Jane .	6269.93959831069
That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Bingley and Jane , she had never doubted ;	2980.269185083737
Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner ;	5535.984917743139
I roused , and interested you , because I was so unlike them .	3732.421553144673
Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty .	3489.1700281658923
and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared with his friend .	3410.4206166004265
Put them next to your great uncle the judge .	8676.888498689894
She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done , and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct .	3173.4475323419897
And which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty ?	5167.570453074112
My dear Lizzy , you cannot think me so weak , as to be in danger now .	2563.7858411146426
She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself , in their first evening at Philips's .	4204.168776705673
I wish it may .	5244.064437709251
She approached , and saw the likeness of Wickham suspended , amongst several other miniatures , over the mantle-piece .	4616.65389534532
but on beholding it , ( for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library , ) he started back , and begging pardon , protested that he never read novels .	3648.8848941398933
When she thought of her mother indeed , her confidence gave way a little , but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with Darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend's connections , than from their want of sense ;	3145.016771806097
The very last evening was spent there ;	5203.56159139277
and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to .	3550.314334283352
CHAPTER XX .	15764.050975065456
Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand .	6429.767031017223
The children have been wanting me this half hour .	5146.568592796619
To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed , she soon afterwards said , I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal .	3381.902586177393
DEAR SIR , I must trouble you once more for congratulations .	6141.631638142588
After breakfast , the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Wickham were returned , and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball .	4118.801481915091
By Hurst and Miss Bingley , they were noticed only by a curtsey ;	3871.7688456654073
and she was quite decided at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining Bingley for his sister .	2221.768447630436
She could have added , A young man too , like you , whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable but she contented herself with And one , too , who had probably been his own companion from childhood , connected together , as I think you said , in the closest manner !	3161.44326403214
the ladies had crowded round the table , where Miss Bennet was making tea , and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee , in so close a confederacy , that there was not a single vacancy near her , which would admit of a chair .	3383.4730045957513
She is a most charming young lady indeed .	3525.291502584826
This matter may be considered , therefore , as finally settled .	4699.245556625064
Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go , merely on that account , for in general you know they visit no new comers .	4040.990289124027
I never saw any one so shocked .	4053.473952256582
and if I were determined to get a rich husband , or any husband , I dare say I should adopt it .	2389.1873370472786
I cannot find out that I hate her at all , or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl .	2526.5641499897224
but Collins , much offended , laid aside his book , and said , I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp , though written solely for their benefit .	3221.2358777745935
but her letters were always long expected , and always very short .	5002.465959826946
but their progress was slow , for Gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little .	3013.882881074853
has thrown herself into the power of of Wickham .	6305.563097667423
To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever .	5017.816673342764
Elizabeth had settled it that Darcy would bring his sister to visit her , the very day after her reaching Pemberley ;	3748.008715348856
He is also handsome , replied Elizabeth , which a young man ought likewise to be , if he possibly can .	2797.838778234107
and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects , which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world .	3484.613755073148
and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford , they reached Gardiner's house , where they were to remain a few days .	3686.8146391355695
whether he had been aware of Jane's attachment , or whether it had escaped his observation ;	5373.650592333024
I suspected as much , replied Elizabeth .	3942.4593708629086
and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there , to know the rest .	3594.533947726131
He has made me so happy , said she , one evening , by telling me , that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring !	2592.5369518031807
Collins was gratified ;	10268.188495804086
She has one only daughter , the heiress of Rosings , and of very extensive property .	3823.137983519743
Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips .	4572.870557255299
and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter .	4534.9557937158
Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon .	5812.051416915234
Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty ;	5100.5473288657895
but , however , do not speak to Darcy about it , if you had rather not .	2313.3382086273846
Gardiner , whose manners were easy and pleasant , encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks ;	4937.503694389564
She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire ;	3466.8020354242094
When they parted , Lady Catherine , with great condescension , wished them a good journey , and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year ;	3434.0540193042457
said he , as he joined her .	3359.5153898340195
I wonder that the very pride of this Darcy has not made him just to you !	4027.3007153786534
E1 through 1 .	9602.607658871702
for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing .	3943.338088654016
I will not trust myself on the subject , replied Wickham , I can hardly be just to him .	2151.8283700053735
Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendance , and when immediately before my father's death , Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me , I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him , as of affection to myself .	2896.838373570197
and Elizabeth sorry for her , and sorry for her father's speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no good .	3139.433154647852
CHAPTER XII .	12871.90986889334
Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham ;	4184.325962370587
It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family .	3334.4417426517307
Occupied in observing Bingley's attentions to her sister , Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend .	3001.3088289204134
but his friend Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine , tall person , handsome features , noble mien ;	3844.0579841584945
To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit <URL> While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements , we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate .	3908.2082097209254
Hurst sang with her sister , and while they were thus employed Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument , how frequently Darcy's eyes were fixed on her .	3196.476813902177
Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him , I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds , or any thing like it , has been advanced .	3643.611056418363
After welcoming their sisters , they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords , exclaiming , Is not this nice ?	4645.901317592375
To these high flown expressions , Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ;	5153.843015737696
the satisfaction of Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face , as made her look handsomer than ever .	3831.463560597696
come into my room .	11040.850721503479
It is difficult indeed it is distressing .	4892.432973038913
And so , you like this man's sisters too , do you ?	4002.148847697567
and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern , when Kitty left them , she went boldly on with him alone .	3389.3444494160226
Collins on his return highly gratified Bennet by admiring Philips's manners and politeness .	5567.296507819646
I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine , that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess , and that the most elevated rank , instead of giving her consequence , would be adorned by her .	2353.3392555434916
So imprudent a match on both sides !	8478.57137098298
If I can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too .	3273.1939352641534
But , Lizzy !	4762.965911567427
Seriously , I would have you be on your guard .	6299.966577046573
And do you impute it to either of those ?	5758.7140516811905
but as she reached the door , it was opened by a servant , and Darcy appeared .	3397.391050763792
She complained bitterly of all this to her husband .	4585.658073147571
You are very cruel , said her sister , you will not let me smile , and are provoking me to it every moment .	2613.55287334533
I have already told her so once , by your desire .	4010.348953317145
Though I know it must be a scandalous falsehood ;	5764.211265595883
Not at all .	5092.919759354693
all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return .	5368.3667580499705
My dear Charles , what do you mean ?	3834.502545624218
Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained ;	4220.167626250746
Heaven and earth !	18207.933137485194

The Miss Webbs all play , and their father has not so good an income as your's .	4445.149671385732
for while he was present , Jane had no attention to bestow on any one else ;	4679.1405254333085
Come , Kitty , I want you up stairs .	6060.0766785227615
I must confess myself surprised by your application ;	4999.546173532971
On opening the door , she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth , as if engaged in earnest conversation ;	4210.54185311778
He was the proudest , most disagreeable man in the world , and every body hoped that he would never come there again .	2522.752748448161
I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be .	2562.6528808823355
I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours , he coldly replied .	3938.8764438798494
Yes , indeed ;	6290.148742560143
Astonishment , apprehension , and even horror , oppressed her .	5801.262548298683
and her Ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey , gave them directions as to the best method of packing , and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way , that Maria thought herself obliged , on her return , to undo all the work of the morning , and pack her trunk afresh .	2925.6582245075288
As for Wickham and Lydia , their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters .	3730.7499039661316
I quite detest the man .	5390.065410257092
She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Darcy that Darcy might leave the country , but that he should stand his ground ;	3145.3148028669225
You have a house in town , I conclude ?	4000.416698723575
Of the lady's sensations they remained a little in doubt ;	7076.708079963949
My avowed one , or what I avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which I have since made .	3135.209736488642
She saw with the creative eye of fancy , the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers .	4371.956466760639
The distance is nothing , when one has a motive ;	5799.658030199454
To know that her daughter would be married was enough .	5058.244444434233
And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing , that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood , before she was banished to the North .	2996.176647995322
You mentioned two instances .	9273.846401141076
I take up my pen again to do , what I have just told you I would not , but circumstances are such , that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here , as soon as possible .	2468.370949846289
No I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did .	3123.4632970676575
Darcy said very little , and Hurst nothing at all .	3583.4878410509777
and already had Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping , when an answer arrived which deferred it all .	3638.926307289764
It could not be for society , as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips ;	3821.260275431382
All this she must possess , added Darcy , and to all this she must yet add something more substantial , in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading .	3522.256242038345
It is settled between us already , that we are to be the happiest couple in the world .	2512.2321801532275
But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede .	4838.903487798749
You mistake me , my dear .	4544.930864758963
And will you promise me , never to enter into such an engagement ?	5401.198449510544
The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases , and again during the chief of the day , was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Collins .	3011.4020253062226
You began the evening well , Charlotte , said Bennet with civil self-command to Miss Lucas .	4179.119344902687
Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in July , and must be in London again within a month ;	4350.621956307518
Hurst thought the same , and added , She has nothing , in short , to recommend her , but being an excellent walker .	4213.489270144923
and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks .	4342.5681028005665
but she was satisfied with none .	4290.223900185745
Indeed , you are mistaken , I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here .	2554.2592762673157
I thought we never should have got into the coach .	4477.851277801572
She wished , she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them ;	3923.990846536344
Oh !	5043.244884590713
for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to Darcy were by no means over .	3702.2447531242756
and I know I appeared distressed .	4319.9671973520435
But you do not know all .	2967.4311187688536
He absolutely started , and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise ;	4477.625026194827
It does seem , and it is most shocking indeed , replied Elizabeth , with tears in her eyes , that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt .	2850.489824360642
She went on .	7375.350825933925
Nay , cried Bingley , this is too much , to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning .	4070.2898188473996
How thankful am I , that we never let them know what has been said against him ;	4248.731129200777
She had also to anticipate how her visit would pass , the quiet tenor of their usual employments , the vexatious interruptions of Collins , and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings .	3149.3328452727187
During their walk , it was resolved that Bennet's consent should be asked in the course of the evening .	3512.4434561523362
She says Lizzy had better have taken Collins ;	5553.196639085803
This information made Elizabeth smile , as she thought of poor Miss Bingley .	3747.3011936527705
but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown , before they are packed up .	3633.873390651936
No sooner did he appear , than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed ;	5122.505089817776
I can safely say , that every advance to intimacy began on her side .	3763.939465252743
It was really a very handsome thought .	4334.553999770747
perhaps that was the reason of his silence ;	7285.794082709649
You know him too well to doubt the rest .	4612.241035006961
That is an uncommon advantage , and uncommon I hope it will continue , for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance .	2995.209755230462
but where other powers of entertainment are wanting , the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given .	4670.7213127137575
Miss Bennet's lovely face confirmed his views , and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority ;	4847.395886971174
But no such recollection befriended her .	4572.3320528089125
In this danger Kitty is also comprehended .	6875.889293098907
and then rising up , said to Elizabeth , Miss Bennet , there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn .	2696.4437209767902
Is not general incivility the very essence of love ?	7012.587267379636
nonsense , how can you talk so !	8087.7618986107655
We have dined nine times at Rosings , besides drinking tea there twice !	4955.5565599221945
cried he , with more feeling than politeness ;	5595.707688561135
His behaviour to myself has been scandalous ;	6557.220279171203
and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire-place , that she might be farther from the door .	2757.841232864147
but his companion was not disposed to make any ;	4687.634895682557
and , at last , on the young lady's whispering to Elizabeth again , he walked away .	2924.506738848527
Allowing the case , however , to stand according to your representation , you must remember , Miss Bennet , that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house , and the delay of his plan , has merely desired it , asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety .	2751.611925147156
I feel as if I had never done you justice , or loved you as you deserve .	4489.378713090382
Their fortune on both sides is splendid .	7851.646023012612
I remain , dear sir , with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters , your well-wisher and friend , WILLIAM COLLINS .	4253.8390712064365
She then ran gaily off , rejoicing as she rambled about , in the hope of being at home again in a day or two .	3202.713009489848
In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ?	5735.378162960089
susceptibility to her feelings ;	14440.877679918704
Not all that Bennet , however , with the assistance of her five daughters , could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Bingley .	3242.877391614033
It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it .	3094.228406183045
I have not been used to submit to any person's whims .	3214.339201758676
Oh !	5043.244884590713
And what sort of table do they keep ?	5295.439619356257
but this was declined , and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness .	3638.720580915578
It will pass away soon enough .	5387.843676279805
There is nothing like dancing after all .	4202.865976470083
The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to Wickham's charge , exceedingly shocked her ;	4258.861372540383
and all was soon right again .	4461.004454167754
but I dare say he may spend half his time here ;	3571.2940095349154
therefore , stay quietly at Longbourn , and depend on my diligence and care .	5250.289382074206
so tall !	19978.946009952117
In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity ;	4750.164174779779
or allow her to hear it from any one but myself .	5204.140513273072
and when at length they turned in at the lodge , her spirits were in a high flutter .	3496.542873278557
First of all , he asked Miss Lucas .	7379.5409901762905
She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height , or rather taller .	4713.736524812121
Elizabeth soon heard from her friend ;	6355.486670667506
None at all .	9736.464941761697
Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again .	4653.968685820096
They must all go to Brighton .	5437.774917437293
he had felt their importance in the family circle .	5754.1683239539825
It may perhaps be pleasant , replied Charlotte , to be able to impose on the public in such a case ;	3044.129077458636
and in the latter object , where she feared most to fail , she was most sure of success , for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour .	3075.1180533163424
The moment of her release from him was ecstacy .	6230.802699867965
Nay , said Elizabeth , this is not fair .	4225.855565724518
They left Brighton together on Sunday night , and were traced almost to London , but not beyond ;	4265.716038706163
I have not a doubt of your doing very well together .	2998.4658868456486
What do you mean , Hill ?	5567.412100031159
and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away .	3295.5080286827356
Nothing of the past was recollected with pain ;	7258.3922258445255
it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life .	3552.163508401677
She had dressed with more than usual care , and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart , trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening .	2603.4034283929504
and besides , it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body , and had so many favourites .	3133.174068148941
Unfortunately an only son , ( for many years an only child ) I was spoilt by my parents , who though good themselves , ( my father particularly , all that was benevolent and amiable , ) allowed , encouraged , almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing , to care for none beyond my own family circle , to think meanly of all the rest of the world , to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own .	3198.914265911999
You are not going to be Missish , I hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report .	3031.277543259378
Aye that is because you have the right disposition .	7334.688778306614
she longed to hear more , and was grateful to her uncle for saying , There are very few people of whom so much can be said .	3599.1840368828407
Whatever I do is done in a hurry , replied he ;	6311.4101956288205
No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there .	5550.552387517502
When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose , or procuring any thing you had a fancy for ?	4553.716494243568
And what did she say ?	6135.742886664961
I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long .	2932.5343314963575
Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact ;	4388.184512188517
Indeed I have , Sir , was her answer .	4785.9537411210395
I was afraid they might not ;	4584.736770035068
Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure , but as his brother was eager in it , he meant to assist him in pursuing it .	3362.08092511482
But her commendation , though costing her some trouble , could by no means satisfy Collins , and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship's praise into his own hands .	3278.905617332038
it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister's being in town .	3823.8464545853317
but the grounds are delightful .	6520.252847868167
There are few people in England , I suppose , who have more true enjoyment of music than myself , or a better natural taste .	3578.325252522894
cried Maria , after a few minutes silence , it seems but a day or two since we first came !	3654.853370115798
I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression .	3920.8877876406364
Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great Lady's attention , which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others .	4101.9143191428075
Sometimes she could fancy , that he talked less than on former occasions , and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her , he was trying to trace a resemblance .	3597.314949806481
As much as I ever wish to be , cried Elizabeth warmly , I have spent four days in the same house with him , and I think him very disagreeable .	2671.4520397038386
Far be it from me , he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure , to resent the behaviour of your daughter .	4346.40413020083
Nothing could be more delightful !	9112.14855129818
But if otherwise , if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been exchanged , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method , in her partiality for Wickham , and that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment .	3060.7744867835954
My poor mother is really ill and keeps her room .	4732.9997661703055
But of this answer Lydia heard not a word .	4437.280543090549
What a delightful library you have at Pemberley , Darcy !	4627.321516888718
Oh , sister !	8211.030907306147
Of music !	19473.119670944405
His attachment to Rosings , certainly increases .	7268.427928284697
It was very little less .	5043.091036212924
She would not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried home ;	4446.821899340169
And Lydia used to want to go to London , added Kitty .	4535.542312796274
I have a high respect for your nerves .	3999.850180613289
he certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible ;	4228.299106414621
it seems but a fortnight I declare ;	7655.5515739395405
and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body .	2937.448655817364
He then handed her in , Maria followed , and the door was on the point of being closed , when he suddenly reminded them , with some consternation , that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings .	2776.0928878633613
and as to Miss Bennet , he could not conceive an angel more beautiful .	3010.106297586025
As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Bingley , and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to , made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane .	3107.64900089722
and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence .	3547.642589094812
Its effect was most extraordinary ;	12053.294456061221
it was to remain the whole winter , and Meryton was the head quarters .	4788.831268088958
How strange !	13627.72137095448
CHAPTER IX .	11147.934488852214
Her hair so untidy , so blowsy !	7644.106947739584
Good bye .	16816.044324972187
And what is your success ?	6243.1316346328595
His character was to speak for itself .	6450.438871710105
they were brightened by the exercise .	9291.528491159805
In the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more ;	4800.946450752353
Why should he have it more than anybody else ?	6710.266908033464

We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes , on purpose to pass for a lady , only think what fun !	4584.024696283793
Has he , has my nephew , made you an offer of marriage ?	5196.780039905394
cried Bennet , shaking her head , then she is better off than many girls .	5348.0451567741575
Had his character been known , this could not have happened .	5176.875188974053
At that moment , she cared for no other .	5604.115789147985
where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making , and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself , some shelves in the closets up stairs .	3974.7309600187796
Her Ladyship , with great condescension , arose to receive them ;	4367.982910057149
I am sure Lizzy will be very happy I am sure she can have no objection .	2217.4731519243655
for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds .	4789.028281886838
Amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment ;	5454.197478009232
but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general , since Jane united with great strength of feeling , a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner , which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent .	3010.3092539962313
how ardently did she long to know , whether any of his were directed in a like manner .	4619.714639141588

but angry people are not always wise ;	6847.617847495696

but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine .	3182.567295067992
And do you really know all this ?	5502.306368752557
If from no better motive , that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest , for dishonesty I must call it .	3012.7451542240788
And yet , upon my honour , I believed what I said of myself to be true , and I believe it at this moment .	3147.5732570005944
I did not think Gardiner was so little to be trusted .	3355.5949147520037
His brother-in-law , Hurst , merely looked the gentleman ;	6489.654011350854
It was hardly enough ;	4840.050404064289
and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did not err .	3027.3499707985984
It was spoken of again while they were at dinner , when Collins joining in , observed , Yes , Miss Elizabeth , you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church , and I need not say you will be delighted with her .	2272.6021118504977
if one could but go to Brighton !	6681.699895346017
It was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ;	3442.606183751773
Their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like man he is a great friend of Darcy's .	5112.9894431845205
After sitting for a moment in silence , she said very stiffly to Elizabeth , I hope you are well , Miss Bennet .	2655.354637520771
But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Gardiner's letter , or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him .	2733.614069092075
You cannot refuse to dance , I am sure , when so much beauty is before you .	2647.455919505772
Well , how pleased I am !	6405.937601455198
But don't imagine it was from any silly cause .	5950.448672449536
I hope not so .	4554.107572119972
Your plan is a good one , replied Elizabeth , where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married ;	4104.515621591562
I often tell young ladies , that no excellence in music is to be acquired , without constant practice .	4107.912207529716
are sufficiently known .	17904.12692570067
She saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow ;	4154.5106262674335
To Elizabeth , however , he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed .	3764.4735668222766
In that case he would return no more .	5031.699362501036
She dared not even mention that gentleman .	6104.710912970574
But , on second thoughts , perhaps Lizzy could tell us , what relations he has now living , better than any other person .	3759.3902741699385
No one but Jane , she thought , could flatter herself with such an expectation .	4246.2124917951505
The girls stared at their father .	6525.52423715307
The person of whom I speak , is a gentleman and a stranger .	4135.789735977743
Whatever my connections may be , said Elizabeth , if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to you .	2919.589666692746
He smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said .	4007.7315450764636
CHAPTER XIV .	11147.934488852214
My mother would have had no objection , but my father hates London .	4473.701333988431
[ Illustration : MATLOCK ] PRIDE AND PREJUDICE : A Novel .	5126.13058889304
Kitty then owned , with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us , that in Lydia's last letter , she had prepared her for such a step .	3212.2620959959313
Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could ;	4079.491505606843
Little more than half a day's journey .	9036.017788643765
and so it does I vow .	5873.532238159777
and therefore it will not signify to anybody here , what he really is .	3924.3379612250524
and by that means , as I told Lady Catherine myself one day , has deprived the British court of its brightest ornament .	3782.5115940192572
Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane , on their first arrival at Lambton ;	3243.308905863818
You may imagine what I felt and how I acted .	5084.855293348187
It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner .	3374.1998878297486
He deserves to be publicly disgraced .	7542.624123527847
Of having another daughter married to Collins , she thought with equal certainty , and with considerable , though not equal , pleasure .	3721.595047567542
and it was settled , that as soon as the ceremony was over , they should proceed to Longbourn .	2547.5169005321186
Bennet was quite in the fidgets .	6782.459046332461
The first part of Gardiner's business on her arrival , was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions .	4354.968101345553

Bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say , but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , I shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as I did before .	3197.5731526205395
It seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence , a most country town indifference to decorum .	4350.621844514301
The idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ;	3633.609893064382
I know my dear uncle and aunt so well , that I am not afraid of requesting it , though I have still something more to ask of the former .	2314.1842583215357
would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe .	8982.589539402807
They look upon it quite as their own , I dare say , whenever that happens .	3598.551867358998
The subject was pursued no farther , and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away .	3043.6122210908293
Reynolds informed them , that it had been taken in his father's life time .	4170.907853702814
Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets , of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won , and Collins , in describing the civility of and Philips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist , enumerating all the dishes at supper , and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House .	3193.5599022036104
His principal object must be , to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham .	4575.686854808316
But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter , depended on the will of the parents .	3870.0263678856613
or that may comfort you , under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parent's mind .	4712.783842645216
But I am particularly attached to these young men ;	3966.0579974288203
He inquired how far Netherfield was from Meryton ;	5913.316812580889
Her father lifted up his eyes .	6306.657157264227
That you were gone into the army , and she was afraid had not turned out well .	3542.3132490919643
Having said thus much , I feel no doubt of your secrecy .	5730.886281816203
Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look ;	7266.745307501477
that , that is the worst of all .	5169.236568949912
and that friendship between a person capable of it , and such an amiable man as Bingley , was incomprehensible .	3194.962262529372
and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley , in spite of that pollution which its woods had received , not merely from the presence of such a mistress , but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city .	2687.2571665515698
Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished .	6862.373581140095
and very lively hopes of Bingley's heart were entertained .	5790.932689263925
He takes them now for people of fashion .	6231.113569270216
She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry ;	4115.155746517899
how can you be so teazing ?	7521.657315713405
and be ready to believe , for every body's sake , that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin .	3802.8355942319386
in every view it is unaccountable !	9552.634807427714
Jane looked a little paler than usual , but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected .	4485.969427505832
said he , taking the letter from his pocket ;	5619.501588530263
La !	26746.76715370772
he hardly ever mentioned your name .	8329.167874899176
Nay , were your friend Lady Catherine to know me , I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation .	3793.9126300273147
Wickham did not play at whist , and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia .	4096.282646064374
I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made her here ;	4319.8469415438285
Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for common use ;	5155.273477722652
I am not a great reader , and I have pleasure in many things .	2431.3479449353185
I cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen , in the whole range of my acquaintance , that are really accomplished .	3045.2072247431684

Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was .	4284.737496531133
A long dispute followed this declaration ;	8616.154836768548
Undoubtedly , replied Darcy , to whom this remark was chiefly addressed , there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation .	4086.3335286238707
My affections and wishes are unchanged , but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever .	4023.651632960864
What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ?	4472.46806978326
There was novelty in the scheme , and as , with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters , home could not be faultless , a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake .	3287.8778013270135
She then spoke of the letter , repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham .	3178.3907805772137
They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them .	3639.614333073881
They had often attempted it before , but it was a subject on which Bennet was beyond the reach of reason ;	2999.3394763697884
It is nothing in comparison of Rosings , my lady , I dare say ;	2730.2042813292524

Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters , would be unpardonable in me .	5568.785283893556
One morning , soon after their arrival , as she was sitting with her two elder sisters , she said to Elizabeth , Lizzy , I never gave you an account of my wedding , I believe .	2638.722085494867
This is your final resolve !	7614.144312530749
I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good .	4471.1688124607
It will not do .	5053.429007304859
You either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other's confidence and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking ;	3923.9311158570617
I quite forgot !	8540.324009094047
Charlotte herself was tolerably composed .	11672.990127089357
Elizabeth was surprised , but agreed to it immediately .	4026.712332886303
and hastily seizing a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt , if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended .	3299.347174193625
Colonel Forster will , I dare say , do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head .	3100.2746643310966
You are safe from me .	4142.801972329427
Here , Sarah , come to Miss Bennet this moment , and help her on with her gown .	5010.822568254309
but from every window there were beauties to be seen .	4922.663700943518
This Younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with Wickham ;	5097.6415505416
You have insulted me , in every possible method .	4951.01939874145
from thence to the library ;	12094.809530031807
to be only just tolerable .	11080.28481537924
But papa is so disagreeable .	7118.112135529645
Why must she be scampering about the country , because her sister had a cold ?	5414.830545373599
I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday .	3392.9106452905407
Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley .	4066.4767858851596
The vicious propensities the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which Darcy could not have .	2826.3310888812957
Jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention .	4398.6342990457315
Darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish , and who probably never looked at you in his life !	3736.117718413454
The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield .	5129.633049322261
Oh !	5043.244884590713
talents which rightly used , might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters , even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife .	4690.677727869023
She turned from sister to sister , demanding their congratulations , and when at length they all sat down , looked eagerly round the room , took notice of some little alteration in it , and observed , with a laugh , that it was a great while since she had been there .	2455.9663367030485
Wickham's happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer , and Collins's proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could .	4094.833276356483
A great deal of good management , depend upon it .	3485.613273997876
You have done all this !	5630.42906593331
The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life , and where they were now to spend a few days , was probably as great an object of her curiosity , as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock , Chatsworth , Dovedale , or the Peak .	3235.8630966023957
but depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our surest way of disappointing him , will be to ask nothing about it .	2822.434408993705
It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment , from which she had been so wholly free at first .	2317.8959982089286
Gardiner had seen Pemberley , and known the late Darcy by character perfectly well .	4626.31117129291
What could be the meaning of it ?	3899.0864337159055
But to be candid without ostentation or design to take the good of every body's character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad belongs to you alone .	3736.9206962457847
and her residence there will probably be of some duration .	4591.024334131352
But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice .	5080.7639777485265
They are generally long ;	7901.048160632147
Exceed their income !	20103.6003481997
Find such a woman as soon as you can , bring her to Hunsford , and I will visit her .	3079.5977231777433
Elizabeth jumped out ;	10675.4635598542
But these are not Jane's feelings ;	6185.3411122865255
Elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her .	3434.943818789388
You think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly .	6845.157827964552
But you have chosen your fault well .	4668.830393104645
All loveliness and goodness as she is !	8018.988323742585
and , to my certain knowledge , more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner .	3563.3803599075413
His air was grave and stately , and his manners were very formal .	4776.083943868889
As they drove to Gardiner's door , Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival ;	4952.798588579581
Oh !	5043.244884590713
But , she continued , recollecting herself , as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him .	2575.0866397136997
My mother is tolerably well , I trust ;	6233.488697788137
At such a time , much might have been said , and silence was very awkward .	4430.706177970308
and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend , met her with every appearance of composure .	4070.470209213454
as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education , and who still resides with them .	4019.253032104345
But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend , where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment , should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire , without waiting to be argued into it ?	3449.7542263108217
and every dish was commended , first by him , and then by Sir William , who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said , in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear .	2823.2178859737946
he had lost every point ;	8343.231291034152
The housekeeper came forward , and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman , the son of her late master's steward , who had been brought up by him at his own expence .	3165.0176208298535
She accounted for it , however , by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn , had by some accident been lost .	3424.8791019955497
Sometimes .	35290.54376147641
for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all .	3756.379837284212
Their reception from Bennet , to whom they then turned , was not quite so cordial .	4031.3691105054886
Why , I must confess , that I love him better than I do Bingley .	3640.009641741377
Aye , there she comes , continued Bennet , looking as unconcerned as may be , and caring no more for us than if we were at York , provided she can have her own way .	3725.4929425676664
it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate .	4856.62664774483
He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names .	4954.969994307846
Elizabeth saw what he was doing , and at the first convenient pause , turned to him with an arch smile , and said , You mean to frighten me , Darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me ?	2933.959721453141
And when the party entered the assembly room , it consisted of only five altogether ;	5050.85547641019
It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy .	4473.931089525841
Yes but as it happens , they are all of them very clever .	5008.967277981175
When Collins could be forgotten , there was really a great air of comfort throughout , and by Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it , Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten .	3535.4053827440794
Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ;	3999.6128872970617
perhaps she meant well , but , under such a misfortune as this , one cannot see too little of one's neighbours .	4929.270370263365
It is evident that you belong to the first circles .	4559.170832851134
This was one point , with regard to Lydia at least , which was now to be settled , and Bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him .	3128.6282436664287
and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room .	3183.805833333964
She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter , and , without knowing or considering what their income might be , rejected many as deficient in size and importance .	3262.0250802204764
CHAPTER VI .	11147.934488852214
but I verily believe I could forgive him any thing and every thing , rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father .	3532.6565979116917
Oh !	5043.244884590713
Her astonishment at his coming at his coming to Netherfield , to Longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire .	3226.0849028063194
The promised letter of thanks from Collins arrived on Tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted .	3591.6962736083733
Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of , cried Colonel Fitzwilliam .	5434.268713706792
I deserve neither such praise nor such censure , cried Elizabeth ;	4170.138940165237
She had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire Militia , in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man , who , on meeting him accidentally in town , had there renewed a slight acquaintance .	2728.924942191806
I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these .	3907.330618096608
No , said her father , Wickham's a fool , if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds .	3040.1640217823533
and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane , nor half so good humoured as Lydia .	2752.8438181726706
Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter ;	6677.493741168483
it jumps from admiration to love , from love to matrimony in a moment .	4534.0457631165555
As soon as I get to town , I shall go to my brother , and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street , and then we may consult together as to what is to be done .	2509.7433856346283
and then , on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured , he replied , Say nothing of that .	2829.303387034916
Certainly not .	13703.721757497213
Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home .	4921.927898158391
and that being the case , I cannot consider your situation with much compassion .	3762.0738726159957
He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her .	3253.746616187512
the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy , received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before ;	3936.779024403612
As she had heard no carriage , she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine , and under that apprehension was putting away her half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions , when the door opened , and to her very great surprise , Darcy , and Darcy only , entered the room .	2640.4651005620776
That tall , proud man .	7612.8094534211
In the hall they parted .	7342.27679982979
They were hopeless of remedy .	6711.509781579615
After an affectionate parting between the friends , Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Collins , and as they walked down the garden , he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family , not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter , and his compliments to and Gardiner , though unknown .	2981.5577270108097
but , recovering herself , said in a lively tone , And pray , what is the usual price of an Earl's younger son ?	3727.185685607072
His most particular friend , you see by Jane's account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her .	3853.9804696201886
She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue , and the mere stateliness of money and rank , she thought she could witness without trepidation .	3257.5983025479372
You must not disappoint your father .	4708.450196569211
Good girl !	17678.952471460554
Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection , and said something of his concern , at having been prevented by business .	3981.319569860894
You may have drawn him in .	5747.396850036457
He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying ;	3610.94469224919
But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes .	2402.9460210644293
If you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence .	4011.223869622296
E3 .	40535.86118978839
I , who have prided myself on my discernment !	4950.409829355164
I beg your pardon , replied Miss Bingley , turning away with a sneer .	3596.7896135673077
I am sincerely grieved for him and F but no one can throw any blame on them .	3066.342698678548
But I pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it .	2846.034160028504
He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which it seems he has been told , by some of the good-natured , gossiping Lucases .	3661.0647490798588
Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly , as well as her affection for Jane ;	3512.700490632706
I am glad he dines here on Tuesday .	3739.2511611393998
Each felt for the other , and of course for themselves ;	4925.6207678534165
She saw herself the object of attention , to tens and to scores of them at present unknown .	4085.083107678827
on the contrary , he was all attention to every body .	4098.051811120445
and , having nothing else to say , was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him .	2406.3310815423874
but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts ;	4086.7940296525207
I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge .	3437.5187588061867
you do not know what I suffer .	5150.815827909346
I can now say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , I have seen nothing of it .	2715.5120667229307
Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education .	5193.627702615427
shocking !	37379.51187044091
She is a great fool for going away , if she liked him .	2715.6209539640076
I am so pleased so happy .	3603.999410035865
Oh !	5043.244884590713
but whatever she said , was spoken in so authoritative a tone , as marked her self-importance , and brought Wickham immediately to Elizabeth's mind ;	4134.382722123333
All was joy and kindness .	9212.117989692466
I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable .	2871.8407837857912
and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning .	2578.075263561607
You tear them to pieces .	8321.283193483585
she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him .	3816.6851870261544
but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's .	3722.7134984784907
but his sisters gave it their hearty assent , and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations .	3995.781971075365
It will be no use to us , if twenty such should come since you will not visit them .	3180.80918846717
but when Philips began to express her concern thereupon , he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance , that he considered the money as a mere trifle , and begged she would not make herself uneasy .	2999.838503954158
She seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute , and never attended to Mary at all .	3182.797572285281
but with him I believe it does not often happen .	4177.78187239053
In spite of what her sister declared , and really believed to be her feelings , in the expectation of his arrival , Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it .	2804.336439647087
but they obligingly satisfied it , with the same kind of supposition , which had appeased Bennet's curiosity ;	3926.201282570158
The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value !	5292.130403889933
but their astonishment was beyond their expectation ;	6194.908718475646
Not Lydia only , but all were concerned in it ;	5269.35721991449
They are all for what they can get .	6014.37825224255
and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared .	3255.7964929719565
Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony , marriage had always been her object ;	5869.734394907126
And of this place , thought she , I might have been mistress !	3695.687976039393
Well , Monday morning came , and I was in such a fuss !	3213.394424758617
and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again .	3658.4774638232125
1 .	9967.378404281952
I confess , said he , that I should not have been at all surprised by her Ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings .	2488.627819801137
determined , if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive , and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female .	3555.5663246924555
and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ;	3222.7376390055947
In society so superior to what she had generally known , her improvement was great .	4274.114737812952
was fonder than ever of Georgiana , almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore , and paid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth .	4513.977557970293
gone to stay .	17189.92313781677
What will you think of my vanity ?	6652.100249849244
I thought I should have broke my heart .	3605.758278569982
Oh , Lizzy !	6221.833824633635
and therefore checked her laugh .	5948.934592496681
She had never perceived , while the regiment was in Hertfordshire , that Lydia had any partiality for him , but she was convinced that Lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body .	2636.6682190580764
Oh , yes !	5724.659857146617
We must not make him desperate .	6881.194929061428
and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour , that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford , she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Darcy's having both spent three weeks at Rosings , and asked him if he were acquainted with the former .	2943.201605319789
His father , Miss Bennet , the late Darcy , was one of the best men that ever breathed , and the truest friend I ever had ;	2872.0100355927357
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come .	4398.146528191689
It was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too , and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it .	2655.2939686756754
They were off Saturday night about twelve , as is conjectured , but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight .	4420.916625664566
What is it you are talking of ?	6074.605048986437
We all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ;	4219.93444560497
His belief of her sister's insensibility , she instantly resolved to be false , and his account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice .	3394.142416399972
and pray when am I to wish you joy ?	5045.7334608360525
But I cannot find out that Jane saw any thing of him in London .	2863.3762723712916
I have no right to give my opinion , said Wickham , as to his being agreeable or otherwise .	2828.694992800417
Much as I abominate writing , I would not give up Collins's correspondence for any consideration .	4712.861166223744
exclaimed Elizabeth , you are too good .	7361.880852918582
But really , and upon my honour , I will try to do what I think to be wisest ;	3925.145433783689
Lydia , my love , ring the bell .	6482.387311459703
I beg your pardon ;	5568.430889490888
Is there nothing you could take , to give you present relief ?	5818.683691970516
She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution , which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments , which she could not otherwise have failed of ;	3287.2562530682976
and in spite of her youth and her manners , she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her .	2901.4336471194324
it told them , that on his arrival , he had immediately found out his brother , and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch street .	3592.071462973511
but I heard nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield .	3744.6806656902413
but proud and conceited .	8818.787108742
Now be sincere ;	14444.39695463698
He only told me , what I have now told you .	3394.397648013097
Oh , that I knew how it was !	3935.8185922703456
The fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious attention .	3409.02790270156
and she sat down directly to the instrument .	4029.8907304454083
A short pause followed this speech , and Hurst began again .	4815.936519028259
My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them .	4305.129023472125
To no creature had it been revealed , where secresy was possible , except to Elizabeth ;	4475.607402703455
Oh !	5043.244884590713
Elizabeth thanked him from her heart , and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying .	4207.881280765072
Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility ;	4835.486395564752
The t te- -t te surprised them .	4281.4846470071825
But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire , she saw him from her dressing-room window , enter the paddock , and ride towards the house .	2975.0434160282184
All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man , who , but three months before , had been almost an angel of light .	4136.129381453345
said Bennet , more than once , as if the credit of making it rain were all her own .	3813.7242537959914
I am excessively attentive to all those things .	3692.3623396846524
There was neither in figure nor face , any likeness between the ladies .	4699.664475377608
Bennet rang the bell , and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library .	4335.395191514622
They were excessively sorry to go !	6289.012538357421
Can this be Darcy !	10432.865594828028
I know how much you dislike him .	3540.0189481436546
After watching her a little , Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful .	5170.854932242979
Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case , and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts .	3140.7758192829583
You are not well enough ;	4731.511079190704
About the middle of the next day , as she was in her room getting ready for a walk , a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion ;	3566.369308789373
Darcy said nothing at all .	4347.524988104954
At that moment they were met from another walk , by Hurst and Elizabeth herself .	4423.651914102851
repeated Miss Bingley .	10827.973072513421
For the liveliness of your mind , I did .	5618.587369335872
and not a note , not a line , did I receive in the mean time .	3879.3884598350446
Bennet , we shall have her at Netherfield at last .	4465.986102143269
But I knew not I was afraid of doing too much .	3451.7207225232796
but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing , that instead of twelve , he had brought only six with him from London , his five sisters and a cousin .	3726.689280598805
CHAPTER XII .	12871.90986889334
They talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his fruit , of every thing but himself ;	3628.2774245697797
Well , he certainly is very agreeable , and I give you leave to like him .	3202.4427720971926
Their first subject was her sister ;	6214.985359284282
and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them , threw a real gloom over their domestic circle ;	3766.7317584572897
She wrote cheerfully , seemed surrounded with comforts , and mentioned nothing which she could not praise .	4045.400186173485
Balls will be absolutely prohibited , unless you stand up with one of your sisters .	4955.837124767268
There can be no occasion for your going so soon .	4674.226435249037
I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure .	3280.860820551812
With many compliments to them , and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter , to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ;	3881.937542874246
It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs , under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants , and heedless of the future , must be very insufficient to their support ;	3629.3393870254413
Would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part , that might offer consolation to such distress .	4870.231063670482
The dinner was exceedingly handsome , and there were all the servants , and all the articles of plate which Collins had promised ;	3678.6688159354926
I rather wonder now at your knowing any .	5546.91838462796
and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement .	2894.324185912757
Mary and Kitty , thank Heaven !	6916.35914018567
She could only imagine however at last , that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible , according to his ideas of right , than in any other person present .	3044.355727721993
Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room .	3227.4559469408728
The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again , called it an age since they had met , and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation .	3540.6129436863903
You supposed more than really existed .	7629.292761675148
and , though little more than sixteen , her figure was formed , and her appearance womanly and graceful .	3561.2076107153925
and when she wrote again , Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys .	2876.1690533188025
In Lydia's imagination , a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness .	5132.501511603695
I was never more annoyed !	4943.781938941166
You have .	7944.29765193284
Indeed , replied Elizabeth , I am heartily sorry for him ;	3112.566088248995
The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion , and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone .	3828.415606590363
and as to my father , I never in my life saw him so affected .	2891.3262685675054
- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies you in writing ( or by e-mail ) within <TIME_PERIOD > of receipt that s he does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm License .	3295.3005188512343
and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled , she had all the success she expected .	3181.2695332437006
That is a question which I hardly know how to answer .	3375.4871581000702
Are the others coming out ?	10577.812632049434
I do not know .	2025.8840739861407
That it ought not to be attempted .	5504.164177018884
But at length , by Elizabeth's persuasion , he was prevailed on to overlook the offence , and seek a reconciliation ;	3639.8242522456676
We are not in a way to know what Bingley likes , said her mother resentfully , since we are not to visit .	3548.343557284629
It was the prospect of constant society , and good society , he added , which was my chief inducement to enter the shire .	3133.65052938872
single , my dear , to be sure !	3846.8238403888636
You will have a charming mother-in-law , indeed , and of course she will be always at Pemberley with you .	2751.0329083311203
Elizabeth was now to see Wickham for the last time .	3915.6077264753535
but not handsome enough to tempt me ;	5555.834861259818
US laws alone swamp our small staff .	10625.532590920453
with less of splendor , and more real elegance , than the furniture of Rosings .	5157.6336932805
she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us , and offered her services , or any of her daughters , if they could be of use to us .	3305.9078583068663
What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation ?	5335.868676995857
I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned .	3151.8600047421255
Hear me in silence .	13383.395457605582
Neglect !	40535.86118978839
but , to counterbalance these advantages , Darcy had considerable patronage in the church , and his cousin could have none at all .	2910.4765415555376
Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place ?	3413.6566186002005
It makes me very nervous and poorly , to be thwarted so in my own family , and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else .	3275.238303500648
Darcy looked up .	9564.086155206956
She was teazed by Collins , who continued most perseveringly by her side , and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again , put it out of her power to dance with others .	2528.856142783126
At four o'clock , therefore , we may expect this peace-making gentleman , said Bennet , as he folded up the letter .	2967.2671164499116
How should you have liked making sermons ?	7811.482097063588
What could he mean ?	7828.734973323863
I have told Miss Bennet several times , that she will never play really well , unless she practises more ;	3208.028031393786
he is a most interesting young man ;	5672.169176597373
Well , I was so frightened I did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ;	2648.6102474646877
Our habits of expence make us too dependant , and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money .	4452.790673339333
And your defect is a propensity to hate every body .	4926.584139526217
We are not rich enough , or grand enough for them ;	4851.978899687407
Elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness , with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal .	4056.1962515034015
They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds .	5760.404595700893
1 .	9967.378404281952
In a short time , I shall have a daughter married .	3577.013087519578
but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art ;	5227.486788384096
Charlotte the wife of Collins , was a most humiliating picture !	5387.338927839317
With my mother up stairs .	8004.37310512427
On this subject I have nothing more to say , no other apology to offer .	4071.6551196994405
Though Darcy could never receive him at Pemberley , yet , for Elizabeth's sake , he assisted him farther in his profession .	4808.979784392524
I can much more easily believe Bingley's being imposed on , than that Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night ;	3739.985673878525
I cannot acquit him of that duty ;	5147.3653361151
Good Heaven !	14982.467771560046
Maria thought speaking out of the question , and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire .	4387.904171887718
Imprudent as a marriage between Wickham and our poor Lydia would be , we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place , for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland .	3618.940296030606
I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner .	4155.681909426507
They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation , and always spending more than they ought .	3789.213264678444
and no less certain is it , that I cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it .	3116.989181385493
He only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town , which you must acknowledge to be true .	3264.0438305802845
Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth , which spoke her distress at such premeditation , and her intreaty that she would not give into it .	3080.9704989114935
He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him ;	4415.9585122213775
and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry .	2618.1745503564352
Poor Lydia's situation must , at best , be bad enough ;	6217.851610740618
and therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , I will take it on myself .	3032.6345812489135
The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed , by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking ;	3264.542816231412
It was not in their direct road , nor more than a mile or two out of it .	2643.9215127239277
As for Mary , she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection , soon after they were seated at table , This is a most unfortunate affair ;	3474.8864986296626
Well , said Charlotte , I wish Jane success with all my heart ;	4013.630583003209
that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars , and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer .	3096.763176773923
By you , I was properly humbled .	6496.509918229213
While settling this point , she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell , and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself , who had once before called late in the evening , and might now come to enquire particularly after her .	2765.4411484614925
1 .	9967.378404281952
Oh !	5043.244884590713
Whatever can give his sister any pleasure , is sure to be done in a moment .	4201.209308403163
Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves ?	8545.48423216935
but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her , that she was only exceedingly shy .	2853.7104825965935
And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last November , for had it been otherwise , I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace .	3597.7288886385163
' Are any of your younger sisters out , Miss Bennet ?	5792.646156924859
Multiple superscripted characters are enclosed by curly brackets ( example : M rs ) .	6731.709039903633
she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not to believe it , and could not help saying so .	2797.5776485852
He should be particularly happy at any time , c .	4564.841059782646
The perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing , or on the evenness of his lines , or on the length of his letter , with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received , formed a curious dialogue , and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each .	3300.2251882379583
Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1 .	4160.799872037173
If he wants our society , let him seek it .	4173.953706150255
As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their aunt , and all Collins's scruples of leaving and Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted , the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton ;	3757.39912642876

With respect to Wickham , the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation ;	3824.3521105686946
It did .	9201.522785013281
He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her ;	3971.5437055431457
CHAPTER XIII .	11147.934488852214
They battled it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved .	3948.0684327929957
but really considering his descent , one could not expect much better .	4602.937466119646
After a short pause , her companion added , You are too generous to trifle with me .	3403.9869055929685
They can only wish his happiness , and if he is attached to me , no other woman can secure it .	2964.4931704110268
I admire the activity of your benevolence , observed Mary , but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason ;	4272.038929869031
I hope you saw her petticoat , six inches deep in mud , I am absolutely certain ;	3325.7995692581794
They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time , and though I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions , I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible .	3292.4199453018846
I thought I should have died .	4304.997991017692
and , before Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt , of which her daughter sat in momentary dread , Bingley , who wanted to be alone with Jane , proposed their all walking out .	2996.3594216027477
It needed all Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity .	5322.857207031945
You alluded to something else .	7130.759357267588
He promises fairly , and I hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent .	3648.1936544346563
and indeed , before we left Bakewell , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country .	3159.2960039393465
and on these occasions , Gardiner , rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's warm commendation of him , narrowly observed them both .	3391.948400995113
Respect , esteem , and confidence , had vanished for ever ;	7785.868779618758
and he went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town .	2422.039391702122
Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly ;	7647.693536692399
Those to her mother , contained little else , than that they were just returned from the library , where such and such officers had attended them , and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild ;	3250.6250545408993
but would my giving you the wished-for promise , make their marriage at all more probable ?	4950.8176862968485
Nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the United States .	4510.857036590659
But I hope you will get over it , and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood .	2640.16591949463
The recollection of what I then said , of my conduct , my manners , my expressions during the whole of it , is now , and has been many months , inexpressibly painful to me .	2864.737993250781
Aye , no doubt ;	12276.58689130744
She said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence ;	3483.6658721704885
We cannot suppose he would help it , if he could .	4401.469938325706
I am the happiest creature in the world .	2060.855135518142
and then you must stay all night .	4407.557538991779
How could he spare half ten thousand pounds ?	5934.567952049681
Perhaps by and bye I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones .	5747.918786461058
Though Elizabeth would not , for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine , have answered this question ;	4343.758527000328
What you ask , said Elizabeth , is no sacrifice on my side ;	3908.2932764693787
She was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ;	4126.583287957253
I must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from declaring my amazement , at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married .	2713.139085782348
to the young ladies he certainly was nothing ;	6576.344162905102
Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort , much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements .	5318.471122514269
and how Lydia could ever have attached him , had appeared incomprehensible .	4885.935647671831
My uncle is to send a servant for us .	4861.215949040451
I see the imprudence of it .	2872.58274184793
Books Oh !	15133.657322753097
I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well and indeed so I do still at my heart ;	4124.4617102678385
Scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning , but their visit to Rosings .	4520.45990135419
I was ready to die of laughter .	4716.490698671115
I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible .	3248.8686823913067
CHAPTER XXII .	15764.050975065456
but consider how much it must increase his disappointment .	5849.719306495279
Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall ;	4824.285887546244
Elizabeth's courage did not fail her .	6917.307377415473
and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations .	3063.8089512908214
is not there a little mistake ?	10237.259733316612
The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends ;	4084.0720905147127
Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above-mentioned ;	6207.252964873464
We have not met since the 26th of November , when we were all dancing together at Netherfield .	3957.18565017317
Are you not diverted ?	10592.31973400318
The communication excited many professions of concern ;	6655.030727570485
He came to tell Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both , Wickham repeatedly , Lydia once .	3044.4529169649823
each of them deep in thought .	9544.33577766067
You saw me dance at Meryton , I believe , Yes , indeed , and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight .	3419.2790782546285
Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother , but remained quietly in the hall , till she and Kitty were out of sight , then returned into the drawing-room .	3144.294872188708
and as she walked up and down the room , endeavouring to compose herself , saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt , as made every thing worse .	2524.88466859006
With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family , and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton , sometimes dirty and sometimes cold , did January and February pass away .	3798.680275228968
Darcy smiled ;	12702.785797190618
but to speak with such civility , to enquire after her family !	4270.3631760825665
and Sir William , to Elizabeth's high diversion , was stationed in the doorway , in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him , and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that way .	3327.7670379270035
Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship .	4712.691854100311
A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued , on either side calm and concise and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister , just returned from their walk .	2870.8985035748615
Could I expect it to be otherwise !	7354.739426336851
and soon laying it wholly aside , she drew near the card-table , and stationed herself between Bingley and his eldest sister , to observe the game .	3859.2599921317546
To and Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself .	4573.112918259381
I do , I do like him , she replied , with tears in her eyes , I love him .	2322.6513778958306
Yes , she will do for him very well .	3871.1850680021266
and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again .	3516.5878830708784
To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted , than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement .	4381.111532708501
But if we do not venture , somebody else will ;	4965.3938466785
The invitation was accepted of course , and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine's drawing-room .	4063.4795612935336
It has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling .	4876.061846264366
and she read it again .	3386.766953875393
It is impossible that he should still love me .	2859.173990821516
but though he was now established only as a tenant , Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table , nor was Hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her .	2950.1530880771006
The eldest of them , a sensible , intelligent young woman , about twenty-seven , was Elizabeth's intimate friend .	3844.8331443143798
Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding , and made no answer .	3533.8403786096897
Her carriage remained at the door , and Elizabeth saw that her waiting-woman was in it .	2834.604624229827
In this quiet way , the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away .	4349.950574518695
but at last on Bennet's leaving them together , after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master , she could not help saying , Oh !	2632.9664990212573
I rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it would happen .	3632.932255810544
and it was settled that Jones should be sent for early in the morning , if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better .	2776.864718620428
Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's meditated elopement .	5445.119208093458
I knew you would be wishing me joy .	4900.126299109716
His letter was soon dispatched ;	8837.443251360011
do we ?	21604.322931457533
To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying .	6887.4569483988835
We dine at Rosings twice every week , and are never allowed to walk home .	4571.412896233625
I do not know who is good enough for him .	1880.0325174593218
But Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on , in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice .	3688.0298655435163
Then , perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying , she added , Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson ;	3833.1551134003357
These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship , and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay .	3706.1071208790795
Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit .	7477.534841901494
and were informed that it was but just done , to give pleasure to Miss Darcy , who had taken a liking to the room , when last at Pemberley .	2461.058536624001
but why did not you tell me so before ?	5334.445619177033
To walk three miles , or four miles , or five miles , or whatever it is , above her ancles in dirt , and alone , quite alone !	4084.0355335285008
But , my dearest Jane , you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday , or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend .	2344.3638538945015
'Tis an etiquette I despise , said he .	6672.692604070286
This part of his intelligence , though unheard by Lydia , was caught by Elizabeth , and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make .	3248.475431387633
Well , my dear , said Bennet , when Elizabeth had read the note aloud , if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness , if she should die , it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Bingley , and under your orders .	2280.5626593735633
At least , you should not remind your Mother of inviting him .	4605.198717941073
Allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not disgrace you , and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear Miss Eliza , ( glancing at her sister and Bingley , ) shall take place .	2735.215642745723
but as I have actually paid the visit , we cannot escape the acquaintance now .	4038.8854953899677
She is not such a simpleton .	5163.732637469081
I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs , absurd and impertinent .	3629.2337844453964
but he had something to direct his search , which was more than we had ;	3572.8040568137867
There he had talked to her friends , when he could not to herself .	3477.129577260637
His circumstances , he assured me , and I had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad .	3651.3020818885525
My father was not only fond of this young man's society , whose manners were always engaging ;	4578.423918798275
Oh !	5043.244884590713
for mine is totally different .	8542.817737287864
It was the second week in May , in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch-street , for the town of in Hertfordshire ;	3063.320099365855
If there were but such another man for you !	5191.817653187854
Pray make my excuses to Pratt , for not keeping my engagement , and dancing with him to-night .	5408.429963625687
If I have wounded your sister's feelings , it was unknowingly done ;	3921.8114754409257
Bingley followed his advice .	10039.361166402332
and after all , Long and her nieces must stand their chance ;	4502.69645529876
She declared her resolution .	8771.692545838314
He made no answer .	4204.773397425297
and really , all things considered , I begin to think it perfectly reasonable .	4201.586401166178
Promise me , therefore , to come to Hunsford .	5338.125097736165
and so generous , that you will always exceed your income .	3873.96269309165
We must not all expect Jane's good fortune .	5722.548219046741
and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued , I remember , when we first knew her in Hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ;	2799.846060212397
I beg you will not go .	3699.2456305260293
A report of a most alarming nature , reached me two days ago .	4976.914308046015
His affection was proved to have been sincere , and his conduct cleared of all blame , unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend .	3492.2407962948546
No ;	16502.532430239946
Yes , yes .	6724.926062155234
She is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else .	3340.855440613192
whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish .	5518.981179584253
and , in my opinion , exertion should always be in proportion to what is required .	3233.4103170339795
Did you speak from your own observation , said she , when you told him that my sister loved him , or merely from my information last spring ?	3471.6368582665627
The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation .	4952.274583239309
Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight , but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction .	3776.34688589609
Any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn , I suppose , would appear far .	4844.396262060793
I want to talk very seriously .	5682.545839292781
Who are your uncles and aunts ?	10114.76437170543
This was agreed to , and Philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets , and a little bit of hot supper afterwards .	3676.410034345484
A man of honour could not have doubted the intention , but Darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation , and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance , imprudence , in short any thing or nothing .	3318.8108155998184
Where does discretion end , and avarice begin ?	8520.45649308747
and , allowing for the loss of Sir William , and there being only one card table in the evening , every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first .	2879.956979611083
When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over , he naturally returned to all his former indolence .	4255.340003947766
CHAPTER IX .	11147.934488852214
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her sister , and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case , was almost incredible !	3055.5715468815624
He saw Wickham , and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia .	4502.791994084442
Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them .	4590.637131609784
You know I have .	6893.555760519492
It will then be publicly seen , that on both sides , we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance .	3802.750377314376
He wrote last week to hurry my return .	5913.104550007398
Jane then took it from her pocket-book , and gave it to Elizabeth .	4720.730134353671
There is but such a quantity of merit between them ;	4384.19046904701
As she spoke , she observed him looking at her earnestly , and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness , convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth .	2985.2026485599163
Well , and so we breakfasted at ten as usual ;	4556.901994906447
Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her .	7401.5392680667055
And this is your real opinion !	6571.113556118834
and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her , was still more strange .	3780.338156405607
She felt that she had no business at Pemberley , and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it .	2377.0132235748683
but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it ;	2862.781041835166
and he soon afterwards said aloud , Bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day ?	3513.3688143257414
Before Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise , Bennet instantly answered , Oh dear !	5565.995771509476
and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her , was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held .	3166.264183184806
And you saw him frequently ?	7280.01023843106
DEAR SIR , The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father , always gave me much uneasiness , and since I have had the misfortune to lose him , I have frequently wished to heal the breach ;	3859.4532314855905
No , I should have turned in a moment .	2941.034505737277
Could he , or the Lucases , have pitched on any man , within the circle of our acquaintance , whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related ?	3940.842799014891
we talked and laughed so loud , that any body might have heard us ten miles off !	5609.534119552319
and , on the father's , from respectable , honourable , and ancient , though untitled families .	3820.9382182954855
She was now , on being settled at home , at leisure to observe the real state of her sister's spirits .	3230.444624842893
so , it will be impossible for her to introduce him , for she will not know him herself .	3268.8988100973856
What think you of this sentence , my dear Lizzy ?	4303.558080169403
Jane's is nothing to it nothing at all .	5159.904598926037
How could she deny that credit to his assertions , in one instance , which she had been obliged to give in the other ?	3332.9847478777556
I dare say the lace upon Hurst's gown Here she was interrupted again .	3500.33490803748
and Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn , nothing remained to be done but to go ;	3632.4851237648368
Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible .	5197.824408140329
and there is no occasion for talking to him , except just now and then .	3092.6326542611528
I dearly love a laugh .	6776.699315921573
but without much success .	7865.401920713334
They saw him often , and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve .	4372.101155541895
said he , with a look of doubt .	3730.5563815695537
Poor Eliza !	20958.709985634305
Speak to Lizzy about it yourself .	10483.998877404612
Not at all , was her answer ;	4986.3198502188725
The same anxiety to get them by themselves , was visible again in the evening .	3749.2658222787245
But he is an ugly fellow !	5668.239706091986
Yes , yes , they must marry .	4697.968558013499
Thursday was to be the wedding day , and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit ;	4737.800254304889
and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future ;	3503.8125963058337
but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at .	5056.289289224459
Remember that she is one of a large family ;	6969.039601803735
They called at various times of the morning , sometimes separately , sometimes together , and now and then accompanied by their aunt .	3782.0520359781026
Bingley , his two sisters , the husband of the eldest , and another young man .	4387.086136820028
Intimate as you are , you must know how it is to be done .	3647.473062956636
My father supported him at school , and afterwards at Cambridge ;	5204.345110389691
for when supper was over , singing was talked of , and she had the mortification of seeing Mary , after very little entreaty , preparing to oblige the company .	3381.133061448664
and their conversation , which had been passing while and Gardiner were engaged with their children , was now put an end to , by the approach of the whole party .	2600.3166555781913
But Georgiana would not join her .	4962.461668696827
With respect to that other , more weighty accusation , of having injured Wickham , I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family .	3632.70554652374
Yet the misery , for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation , received soon afterwards material relief , from observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her former lover .	4044.8179883792504
Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile .	6537.0562796161585
It distressed her a little , and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage .	3099.3774725795397
But I have other provocations .	5246.250968024524
He studies too much for words of four syllables .	5777.26756230705
From their infancy , they have been intended for each other .	5158.679843462753
he had all the best part of beauty , a fine countenance , a good figure , and very pleasing address .	4060.2548237599867
and she asked Bingley , whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present .	3047.532293999239
They followed her into the dining-parlour .	6632.6079545946
and after some contrivance , the whole party , with all their boxes , workbags , and parcels , and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's and Lydia's purchases , were seated in it .	2869.1675944636777
On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls , whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room , and whose shyness , as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth , prevented their coming lower .	3217.904390796387
but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour .	3595.9417783325794
and on his return , brought back , with great satisfaction , a message from her Ladyship , importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her .	2779.975723552264
I have no reason , I assure you , said he , to be dissatisfied with my reception .	1821.0226937997666
In essentials , I believe , he is very much what he ever was .	3647.6975733409868
Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday ;	9151.047897240749
and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there ;	4290.46710977007
and they soon became sensible , that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old , and whose own manners indicated respectability , was not to be hastily rejected .	2980.382358228751
Bromley , of course .	11470.43822611501
Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth , where confidence would give pleasure ;	4918.03948127662
What congratulations will then flow in !	8421.231353434869
My dear Bennet , said his lady to him one day , have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last ?	3511.601196533016
His countenance rather gained in austerity ;	8049.075006969738
The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family , connections , or fortune .	4307.93896344859
I do not know of any other designs that he had formed : but he was in such a hurry to be gone , and his spirits so greatly discomposed , that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this .	2194.189250569133
He has always something to say to every body .	3620.3784412773753
but there were two or three much uglier in the shop ;	4604.662838389937
If he wishes to avoid seeing me , he must go .	4398.089710460023
Have you not heard me say , that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ?	4886.970166285449
and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before , was now high in her good graces .	2561.4458789164546
she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ;	6605.088936717925
Bennet , you are wanted immediately ;	5291.520265924282
My real purpose was to see you , and to judge , if I could , whether I might ever hope to make you love me .	3131.3625369862643
Oh !	5043.244884590713
He made a little mistake to be sure ;	5079.012245521859
This event had at last been despaired of , but it was then too late to be saving .	4368.930300029424
On this subject , what can you have to say ?	4680.901326007602
But will they make you happy ?	7261.672515564621
She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment ;	4949.167358123634
There could be no conversation in the noise of Philips's supper party , but his manners recommended him to every body .	3636.8563882614403
An union of a different tendency , and precluding the possibility of the other , was soon to be formed in their family .	4068.6976337427373
Yes ;	10872.67006892519
Elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ;	4611.482886268827
Did you see him while you were at Lambton ?	6950.185467316259
I do comprehend a great deal in it .	2307.217487235282
Did she call to refuse her consent ?	9029.79071160933
They must have seen them together for ever .	4448.338458603971
With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew ;	7965.044342788854
I am sure my sisters must all envy me .	2586.261677358077
I hope we may often meet again .	3872.3135614249027
There was not much in the question , nor in the preceding remark , but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning .	3454.1273253798568
She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of Darcy's sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , she turned up the lane , which led her farther from the turnpike road .	3024.150460422396
His sister was less delicate , and directed her eye towards Darcy with a very expressive smile .	4763.007468930763
Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend .	3027.0834926533125
I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Bingley .	2699.927199356208
Bingley is most unaffectedly modest .	9881.529073229518
With a renewal of tenderness , however , they repaired to her room on leaving the dining-parlour , and sat with her till summoned to coffee .	3829.7334561190987
Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment .	3470.888319663958
With a glance she saw , that he had lost none of his recent civility ;	3672.5202592103165
Would Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it ?	5189.622985008253
But above all , above respect and esteem , there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked .	3431.3449815794393
There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others .	3783.0617676530173
And as I come back , I can call on Lady Lucas and Long .	4492.119625824988
She will be down in a moment I dare say .	3075.970574362909
There is nothing he would not do for her .	3092.1964689645456
and for your own , let her be an active , useful sort of person , not brought up high , but able to make a small income go a good way .	3647.297020952959
Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed .	4878.496717158584
The dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last ;	5450.980121728462
At length , in a voice of forced calmness , he said , And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting !	2882.092495041539
she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld !	6522.019976528118
The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton ;	5272.115474843639
Very odd !	18673.874022237258
Her teeth are tolerable , but not out of the common way ;	4505.476856555557
They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in ;	4926.027877211559
but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable , they are not , I hope , quite so easily changed as that implies .	3286.04294969546
[ Illustration : DOVE-DALE ] PRIDE PREJUDICE .	7875.698658450208
Lady Catherine is a very respectable , sensible woman indeed , added Charlotte , and a most attentive neighbour .	3521.783461224671
and as for Hurst , by whom Elizabeth sat , he was an indolent man , who lived only to eat , drink , and play at cards , who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout , had nothing to say to her .	2771.7260011112494
and when Bingley was gone , Jane constantly sought the same means of relief .	4062.5794342243958
and the kind of half-expectation which Gardiner had formed , of their being followed by a letter from him , had ended in nothing .	2857.5885785870482
She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter .	3725.2555749401386
After wandering along the lane for two hours , giving way to every variety of thought ;	5271.180832501207
and such I might still have been but for you , dearest , loveliest Elizabeth !	4662.3299731386915
Much had been done , and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday ;	5183.883075963839
And his behaviour , so strikingly altered , what could it mean ?	5359.018616528259
My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking .	4168.1767343668325
It was gratitude .	5600.915837796719
One morning , about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been formed , as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining-room , their attention was suddenly drawn to the window , by the sound of a carriage ;	3250.9203952352514
Certainly , he replied , biting his lips .	5626.994138469593
I honour your circumspection .	8030.904574922394
and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general , he can have no objection , I am sure , to oblige us for one half hour .	2457.881455277203
Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these .	5981.3824155748725
He is gone to my father already .	5085.5993868855285
When the ladies were separating for the toilette , he said to Elizabeth , Do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your apparel .	3004.2365021248784
He bore it with noble indifference , and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy , had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Darcy , with an expression of half-laughing alarm .	2854.860721429815
and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery .	3370.77619944627
and Wickham had constant admission to the house .	3953.4422579499555
and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly commendable , and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate , will be kindly overlooked on your side , and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch .	2935.619389545865
she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood , nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two , to visit his relations .	3638.239731337453
but she had not got beyond the words delightful , and charming , when some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her , might be mischievously construed .	3205.597928337119
Very well and this offer of marriage you have refused ?	6411.37814296569
My dear Hill , have you heard the good news ?	4543.871585794822
They crossed it by a simple bridge , in character with the general air of the scene ;	5037.034091794185
You appear to me , Darcy , to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection .	3577.0569901114236
Well , and so just as the carriage came to the door , my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Stone .	3465.9448982970875
In my opinion , the younger son of an Earl can know very little of either .	4204.79931310473
and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification .	3278.2182661475535
Had you then persuaded yourself that I should ?	6870.532365586184
and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling .	3084.6143355438526
that if he is so , you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me .	3361.2369511796805
and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night , she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon .	2788.7183546119527
I do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Darcy .	2668.7542490134792
Had she merely dined with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ;	3808.2069316062093
but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him .	4010.219555595536
dear Lizzy , only consider what he must have suffered .	6706.9777440210955
I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure .	4149.17699631732
That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side , too , was another very welcome surprise ;	3813.8873586477876
In spite of having been at James's , Sir William was so completely awed , by the grandeur surrounding him , that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow , and take his seat without saying a word ;	2843.6001896791704
my dear , cried his wife , I cannot bear to hear that mentioned .	3247.3942129386332
You can now have nothing farther to say , she resentfully answered .	4067.8527334144387
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States .	3968.2752460224388
How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year !	3836.628024000413
Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Philips , and she ventured , without any permission , to do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton .	3397.3270403761144
Her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour : his judgment could not err , and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth , as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable .	3294.961470436169
and he found in Philips a very attentive listener , whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard , and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could .	2877.041236656689
When Lydia went away , she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and Kitty ;	4112.105334226895
It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom .	3750.496910645328
Their eyes instantly met , and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush .	4354.965812512013
Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed , as to leave her very little attention for her book ;	3365.6627081426504
She was even sensible of some pleasure , though mixed with regret , on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Darcy and herself .	3249.5220026744914
and she was more grieved than astonished to hear , in reply to her minute enquiries , that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits , there were periods of dejection .	3245.705060442687
And may I ask ?	9631.909784747408
In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure , said Bingley ;	3470.6993550501898
and more than once during dinner did Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth , I am glad you are come back , Lizzy .	2600.9957268455296
your father of course may spare you , if your mother can .	6343.418388975452
and of late it has been shifting about pretty much .	4546.011476962295
its solace was visiting and news .	10644.113224440278
Have you seen any pleasant men ?	9019.077764464922
But Bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own .	3930.499848179758
Elizabeth hesitated , but her knees trembled under her , and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them .	3159.593405376542
You have only proved by this , cried Elizabeth , that Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition .	2954.9919027251863
but I believe we must abide by our original plan .	4767.985387057408
for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health , and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight .	3048.2127197858513
That is all to be forgot .	6147.6119908169
and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Bennet's being quite unable to sit alone .	3399.3159546254624
You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night .	3990.9156952722997
Yes , I really believe Darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care .	3705.487981413926
She is up stairs , and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all .	3550.656601620432
With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added , How long did you say that he was at Rosings ?	4024.2557982152684
People did say , you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas ;	6263.415514726674
She put down the letter , weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality deliberated on the probability of each statement but with little success .	3805.7508051493746
Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing , after all .	6171.1047034793755
But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side , said Jane .	2767.5466557698987
Implacable resentment is a shade in a character .	8027.100143180923
FITZWILLIAM DARCY .	26925.301185366065
Your reproof , so well applied , I shall never forget : 'had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner .	3720.956359196761
at first .	17539.130109003734
The letter shall certainly be burnt , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard ;	3950.3401592314162
And there is something of dignity in his countenance , that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart .	3644.5719760866964
Oh !	5043.244884590713
Her father , contented with laughing at them , would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters ;	4663.050855209455
Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow , and sat down again to her work , with an eagerness which it did not often command .	3476.680708510322
and , alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother , we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London .	3327.168017116516
to the last .	10724.263624618283
Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt , and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description , when Hurst called them to order , with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward .	3720.117518363246
Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea , and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies .	3529.6300794675994
And you only the second .	7614.759194202724
Philips was always glad to see her nieces , and the two eldest , from their recent absence , were particularly welcome , and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home , which , as their own carriage had not fetched them , she should have known nothing about , if she had not happened to see Jones's shop boy in the street , who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away , when her civility was claimed towards Collins by Jane's introduction of him .	2681.1395295473694
What a letter is this , to be written at such a moment .	3410.106683548497
for though the chief of his concerns , with the son of his patron , were imperfectly understood , it was yet a well known fact that , on his quitting Derbyshire , he had left many debts behind him , which Darcy afterwards discharged .	3114.62430261989
There are few people whom I really love , and still fewer of whom I think well .	3929.07247321527
His debts to be discharged , and something still to remain !	6358.125447484052
and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino , the two girls had the honour of assisting Jenkinson to make up her party .	2809.287555624751
It soothed , but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self-attracted by the rest of her family ;	3028.3420278302924
But your family owe me nothing .	6070.981994486242
Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad ?	4715.222516336545
Oh !	5043.244884590713

Even Elizabeth began to fear not that Bingley was indifferent but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away .	4558.267179770002
The satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her husband , might then have rested in its proper place .	3420.4181771451226
and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs , to think of any thing else .	2496.6196873936797
but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line .	4779.136899531757
I believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as I do .	3109.754774163875
The party seemed so well selected , so suitable one with the other .	4343.052179890545
But when they see , as I trust they will , that their brother is happy with me , they will learn to be contented , and we shall be on good terms again ;	3049.701348371726
Do let us have a little music , cried Miss Bingley , tired of a conversation in which she had no share .	3446.571947839738
She answered in the affirmative , and , unable to resist the temptation , added , When you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance .	3223.504945056997
It was not known that Wickham had a single relation , with whom he kept up any connection , and it was certain that he had no near one living .	2662.7331104910236
and Elizabeth , after all the misery of the morning , found herself , in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed , seated in the carriage , and on the road to Longbourn .	2473.105527408778
It is every way horrible !	5511.698674179362
cried Miss Bingley , Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable .	4848.121969529799
and the other , that she herself had been barbarously used by them all ;	2757.8120130418943
The usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter .	5277.465791793905
It is unaccountable !	5597.421809305715
Bennet made no answer , and each of them , deep in thought , continued silent till they reached the house .	2778.5618365918917
The others have been gone on to Scarborough , these three weeks .	5139.207126065436
I am not likely to leave Kent for some time .	2637.9728790352715
I am thinking of what you have been telling me , said she .	2167.7623454315853
he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen !	6179.593492913119
I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals , but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them .	2192.4998607704943
About a month , said Elizabeth ;	5343.530202070767
She could think of nothing more to say ;	3387.1813598069107
I am very glad you liked her .	2498.089708603528
He called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil , which had been brought on by himself .	3199.134982990204
You are all kindness , Madam ;	5646.754603357471
She will follow wherever Lydia leads .	6273.608971736642
What a contrast between him and his friend !	5749.113624817933
Ah !	25580.072097342923
indeed you have no reason .	10243.593860543442
In her own past behaviour , there was a constant source of vexation and regret ;	4017.369970889697
If I may so express it , he has a right to be proud .	4034.4612643027826
Only think of its being three months , she cried , since I went away ;	4358.1500985752455
if the first , I should be completely in your way ;	4803.3232596663365
He was as generous , she doubted not , as the most generous of his sex .	3662.73945190312
And this , cried Darcy , as he walked with quick steps across the room , is your opinion of me !	3241.7116186941716
If I , said Collins , were so fortunate as to be able to sing , I should have great pleasure , I am sure , in obliging the company with an air ;	2211.910129310369
and Lydia , in a voice rather louder than any other person's , was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her .	2826.2291445393957
She seems perfectly happy , however , and in a prudential light , it is certainly a very good match for her .	2294.927153998987
E1 .	27672.02912185821
Invented by M rs Bell 26 Charlotte Street Bedford Square .	8365.871954129874
and had some new extracts to admire , and some new observations of thread-bare morality to listen to .	3930.4679661541236
True , said Bennet , but it is a comfort to think that , whatever of that kind may befal you , you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it .	2587.085588956863
certainly , said Elizabeth , though burning with curiosity ;	5279.018971421135
or , with a mind so occupied , she might have forgotten where she was .	3659.1065229910964
Oh !	5043.244884590713
Regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure , but I wrote to Wickham , who left the place immediately , and Younge was of course removed from her charge .	4011.9678409580656
I know it cannot be long .	3725.057738501695
My beauty you had early withstood , and as for my manners my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not .	3237.9795452260614
But there was still something lurking behind , of which prudence forbad the disclosure .	4301.262229185907
These were the contents : MY DEAR HARRIET , You will laugh when you know where I am gone , and I cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning , as soon as I am missed .	3228.1157274717516
and every body began to find out , that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness .	2856.3962257884937
But I ought to beg his pardon , for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant .	2833.2212906764066
With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted !	6874.301758480077
She had high animal spirits , and a sort of natural self-consequence , which the attentions of the officers , to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her , had increased into assurance .	3010.142166157828
but unable to contain herself , began scolding one of her daughters .	3917.7967231517455
Heaven forbid !	19587.763475129905
and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again .	4034.314242887295
Colonel Forster came yesterday , having left Brighton the day before , not many hours after the express .	4400.855135295299
Not a word , however , passed his lips in allusion to it , till their visitor took his leave for the night ;	3610.1077809122994
It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Darcy than they had before any idea of ;	3334.795286015725
I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude .	3573.743558165102
but now , as soon as they were alone together , she said , I saw you look at me to-day , Lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present report ;	2524.787560258677
Lydia was Lydia still ;	11293.140121126258
I should have considered it as part of my duty , and the exertion would soon have been nothing .	2873.160239633477
I was very uncomfortable , I may say unhappy .	3838.8590828551487
And your assurance of it , I suppose , carried immediate conviction to him .	2670.5148885589942
and Mary , at the end of a long concerto , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs , at the request of her younger sisters , who with some of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room .	2718.6333748565735
though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them .	3096.3761652768103
To work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures ;	5758.206177372626
He could even listen to Sir William Lucas , when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country , and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at James's , with very decent composure .	3333.149804708727
and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own .	2667.652074481373
and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and at first was resolved not to break it ;	3069.9013129585314
Her mind was less difficult to develope .	7365.938946087899
Oh !	5043.244884590713
that of Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest ;	8550.805101656812
Instead of viewing them as a stranger , I might have rejoiced in them as my own , and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt .	3653.694141517219
and as Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her's , it was performed in a proper manner , without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary .	3121.4020122738975
was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room , and from all the others when they sat down to table .	2655.646248022802
his sisters declared that they were miserable .	7814.720805789815
It had not been very great ;	4854.131156269477
You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary , compressed , marked up , nonproprietary or proprietary form , including any word processing or hypertext form .	3927.835877540141
And so , my dear sister , I find from our uncle and aunt , that you have actually seen Pemberley .	2386.9271690401333
The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week ;	5436.835249679502
I do , indeed , replied Elizabeth , colouring .	2661.7679144324293
A person may be proud without being vain .	6764.521120722385
For the truth of every thing here related , I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam , who from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the executors of my father's will , has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions .	3368.371153978956
I shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his constancy .	4211.12095413088
I should never have said Collins was settled near her family .	3297.7070497726295
Wretched , wretched , mistake !	13615.361597213987
Those who do not complain are never pitied .	8395.007502668062
Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete , old , middle-aged and new computers .	4159.956505793027
How differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned !	5002.156557325228
Elizabeth , you are not serious now .	3690.6689327922304
All this was acknowledged to Gardiner ;	9329.44791766968
What a fine thing for our girls !	6779.511951288105
You did !	12855.254246833345
No man of common humanity , no man who had any value for his character , could be capable of it .	3372.0509946187344
but at length was reduced to be reasonable .	5628.4324196310135
It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Bingley to see you all after him so soon ;	3520.986976432703
An excellent consolation in its way , said Elizabeth , but it will not do for us .	3022.045069842817
Nothing had ever suggested it before , but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter , than by supposing a partiality for their niece .	3913.912679095673
But , he added , you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them , with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here .	2982.76220101261
Is there one among the sex , who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman ?	4819.927541374044
At length , she spoke again .	4620.1735507069225
and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement .	4647.591703437412
See <URL> Transcriber's note : Text enclosed by underscores is in italics ( italics ) .	6230.851832234042
I have just as much right to be asked as she has , and more too , for I am two years older .	3114.00037681326
he shook his head when I expressed my hopes , and said he feared W was not a man to be trusted .	3910.2677847838736
My dear Lizzy , where can you have been walking to ?	3750.804144735103
After a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner , and thus began , In vain have I struggled .	4438.460710164269
But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault because I would not take the trouble of practising .	3461.1214524826687
and , of course , I could not rest till I knew the particulars .	3224.08087904344
That lady I suppose is your mother .	6327.182955016558
and on their being seated , a pause , awkward as such pauses must always be , succeeded for a few moments .	3636.270545855189
From the former .	9420.594466407665
There was one part especially , the opening of it , which I should dread your having the power of reading again .	3049.836640021627
They came .	12466.68164800232
and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed .	3027.865006043968
Wickham is safe .	13018.838841439716
and Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem .	3701.4193501110176
Many stared .	21854.180232861334
