Average perplexity: 503.7717807383093
I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner .	95.6490374896686
and to him she had hardly courage to speak .	91.71090181370944
At that ball , while I had the honour of dancing with you , I was first made acquainted , by Sir William Lucas's accidental information , that Bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage .	4.172806217099729
My aunt Philips came to Longbourn on Tuesday , after my father went away ;	29.661116430423952
Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Robinson ;	68.95422496861939
I should take him , even on my slight acquaintance , to be an ill-tempered man .	21.73658452372725
The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret .	30.58644809221283
That is all very proper and civil , I am sure , said Bennet , and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman .	11.559049128106587
When I went away , I felt that it would soon happen .	45.91969580114504
and she felt capable under such circumstances , of endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters .	21.723134162858987
But that is not the case here .	184.00152770602074
Such I was , from eight to eight and twenty ;	68.98385176489435
and so extremely accomplished for her age !	183.55781701670938
or at least it was impossible not to try for information .	57.372500487427395
Nor I , I am sure , said Miss Bingley .	93.74221547104321
The day passed most pleasantly away ;	282.3552787512534
There has been many a one , I fancy , overcome in the same way .	25.15046736227731
It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week .	30.59467291590955
for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know , and read great books , and make extracts .	13.526906804884316
and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon , was such an instance of Lady Catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough .	7.149889222292853
She was quite amazed at her own discomposure ;	126.15513261589551
How abominable !	4747.096473246571
After a few minutes reflection , however , she continued , I do remember his boasting one day , at Netherfield , of the implacability of his resentments , of his having an unforgiving temper .	5.797848738176642
Elizabeth again , and more seriously assured her of its truth .	53.70164946292056
and the effort which the formation , and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read .	6.05306862593489
these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce ;	21.71546549754084
and I have enquired of every body too , who is likely to know .	29.55638999238604
Here was knowledge in which no one could partake ;	91.57233244155437
C below .	4743.677376410631
The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents , about a twelvemonth ago , was now brought forward again .	11.229000596766417
but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine .	53.89735205524161
Since her being at Lambton , she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud ;	26.082080575994503
and oh !	4744.001981670859
Did you see it ?	880.8534260408155
I must be in town next Saturday .	183.2709417074034
A lady's imagination is very rapid ;	282.48421472310156
They stood for some time without speaking a word ;	95.66658791421001
The morrow produced no abatement of Bennet's ill humour or ill health .	43.03917530227505
He had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them ;	26.018590497008088
She told the story however with great spirit among her friends ;	53.6992936169039
How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter !	53.71354201991081
If I had known as much this morning , I certainly would not have called on him .	19.01973207867416
The old lady is Jenkinson , who lives with them .	68.88060192205867
At least , therefore , I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies .	13.673529300624091
Bennet , in equal silence , was enjoying the scene .	69.04235897003946
That his two sisters and Darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough , and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable .	3.866757207164784
I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous elopement .	35.3123439406453
and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and forwarded , as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side .	6.979699859363456
and the beautiful pyramids of grapes , nectarines , and peaches , soon collected them round the table .	16.810673496872
Transcriber's note : Spelling and hyphen changes have been made so that there is consistency within the book .	16.80241529948447
But I must tell you how it went off .	91.38626285786299
He bore it however with admirable calmness .	182.92834490122445
To be sure , you knew no actual good of me but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love .	12.347304426610485
Why should they try to influence him ?	183.16570495715496
His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others , as in his reproaches to myself .	6.235871625316462
and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own , it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance .	5.953711411101223
Elizabeth was not surprised at it , as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill .	26.00235407794515
that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation , than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance .	7.146360046091982
You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas .	91.41701807147977
People do not die of little trifling colds .	126.07739456675078
With all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it , am I wrong , my dearest Jane , in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many ?	4.909520384464298
And then we were so merry all the way home !	74.13588434035114
Indeed , Mama , you are mistaken , said Elizabeth , blushing for her mother .	30.72645930543691
I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat .	35.30624493575843
and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley .	5.726438700480845
No , indeed , I did not .	221.86244657322158
Darcy's letter , she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart .	29.655677083953304
I cannot think so very ill of Wickham .	139.365362888202
he actually danced with her twice ;	309.709785286265
and Jane more especially , who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself , had she been the culprit , was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure .	5.778295065997969
said Lydia stoutly , I am not afraid ;	146.41243052699335
and Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages .	12.287777014310198
Lizzy , why am I thus singled from my family , and blessed above them all !	21.78490306771615
though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present , because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character .	2.9791849529783025
The idea of Collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther , and he continued : My reasons for marrying are , first , that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances ( like myself ) to set the example of matrimony in his parish .	2.2439841905805387
Upon my word !	1875.6060213906733
and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , she could , perhaps , believe , that remaining partiality for her , might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned .	4.2252863834730805
Her favourite walk , and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine , was along the open grove which edged that side of the park , where there was a nice sheltered path , which no one seemed to value but herself , and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity .	3.0541749186807
I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear .	10.338800089469352
And what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail ?	38.042529464127
Widely different was the effect of a second perusal .	95.64525075053155
We will know where we have gone we will recollect what we have seen .	30.69002137008538
Her fellow-travellers the next day , were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable .	18.758981240583623
And then when we came away it was such fun !	69.21630222330865
or rather he has not Wickham's countenance , for his features are perfectly good .	29.582995593594408
How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence , she could not imagine .	24.706568282981554
for at any rate , there seemed a gulf impassable between them .	45.75727177585254
and she told me that it was certain true .	91.3733702366831
His regard for her was quite imaginary ;	182.97831599814833
and for the last half year , nay , for a twelvemonth , she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity .	9.78001744960569
Her astonishment , however , was extreme ;	203.55827605249576
This is the estimation in which you hold me !	91.52004120783924
when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them , and Elizabeth , looking earnestly in her face , was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever .	6.3598341085481165
In short , my dear aunt , I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy ;	12.404376585388677
Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark , and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks , unless you receive specific permission .	9.779838994100647
What will become of me .	475.0905214348512
But do you always write such charming long letters to her , Darcy ?	35.4237597198888
But how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable ?	44.728241557001276
but checking himself , he added in a gayer tone , Is it in address that he improves ?	16.803333500345172
Professor Michael S Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone .	9.358845880775679
This account then is what he has received from Darcy .	68.90196004633508
They were interrupted by Miss Bennet , who came to fetch her mother's tea .	30.61267303055948
and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity .	91.72024236937322
she is not acting by design .	282.5423181007908
Jane was not happy .	876.7372897970012
Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers , and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed , or a really new muslin in a shop window , could recal them .	4.977790327162445
it gives such an elegance to misfortune !	183.05317268462866
Other schemes too came into her head .	182.9046321206164
I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister .	26.024895323629117
If I were as rich as Darcy , cried a young Lucas who came with his sisters , I should not care how proud I was .	8.827494845138252
I shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier .	55.98438806460774
though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm , at her lively , sportive , manner of talking to her brother .	8.89015420706666
1 .	10898.860396037358
Yes , madam , said Bennet , delighted to speak to a lady Catherine .	34.80069770705628
Pray , what is your age ?	299.924709311515
And one of my own daughters .	282.38495090954865

I have been most highly gratified indeed , my dear Such very superior dancing is not often seen .	17.338335774553023
If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of , the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time , for from the day of the invitation , to the day of the ball , there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once .	2.9614744029706497
To this , Mary very gravely replied , Far be it from me , my dear sister , to depreciate such pleasures .	12.986199931012576
In the evening , soon after Bennet withdrew to the library , she saw Darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme .	7.377554893809001
She saw instantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage ;	35.38261549729007
Her answer was warmly in his favour .	182.96855453179248
Darcy made no answer , and seemed desirous of changing the subject .	45.75857204005503
How are they even to be discovered ?	182.98574828639642
She enquired after his sister , but could do no more .	53.6992936169039
she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined in company with him four times .	14.885940560815024
Are you much acquainted with Darcy ?	283.92185932113
We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton .	29.552070406116016
My object then , replied Darcy , was to shew you , by every civility in my power , that I was not so mean as to resent the past ;	6.950956317875775
How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains !	43.049491474814225
I mean , that no man in his senses , would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a-year during my life , and fifty after I am gone .	5.94190583363271
You must not suspect me .	475.7406891640975
Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred , during their visit , as they returned , except what had particularly interested them both .	9.089924033714627
Who would have thought it !	473.1130194100218
I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment .	79.3919180354844
Our plain manner of living , our small rooms , and few domestics , and the little we see of the world , must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself ;	6.134463017903311
You dare not , you cannot deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of dividing them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind .	2.957897684312607
When they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ;	10.405622535846907
Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow .	192.95127986903518
In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion , with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode , and the improvements it was receiving , he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them ;	4.502384524549525
I will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away , and come back again .	12.323354845961882
Well , Lizzy , said Bennet one day , what is your opinion now of this sad business of Jane's ?	14.502073749718699
But I hope you will not mind it : it is all for Jane's sake , you know ;	18.330711531182452
and it is that which makes the wonder .	126.29559647151324
She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought ;	16.84034793316387
Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment , nor were the other ladies often absent ;	20.536156664581462
Darcy danced only once with Hurst and once with Miss Bingley , declined being introduced to any other lady , and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room , speaking occasionally to one of his own party .	4.618360275093208
and though his pride was hurt , he suffered in no other way .	36.644952285849406
The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master , who was coming down in a day or two , to shoot there for several weeks .	6.460362677087953
There is a lady , it seems , a Younge , who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what .	4.769311263434823
He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her ;	8.885839938001034
He had not been long seated before he complimented Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters , said he had heard much of their beauty , but that , in this instance , fame had fallen short of the truth ;	4.196190686024688
Miss Bingley was engrossed by Darcy , her sister scarcely less so ;	43.09544223042713
They will have nothing else to do .	193.90165933803243
In point of composition , said Mary , his letter does not seem defective .	29.548713030795167
he was lively and unreserved , danced every dance , was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield .	7.7865230192476576
it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her .	19.02131813719156
That is his notion of christian forgiveness !	183.20956974969667
what hours of transport we shall spend !	183.41372786452467
Oh !	8965.45062507954
so much ease , with such perfect good breeding !	91.50792920719019
Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness .	11.228419059099583
It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night .	20.41425418174281
I cannot quite agree with you there .	183.1376054435776
it is just as he chooses .	284.04577207055746
I am not romantic you know .	282.9697641415798
Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed , a mixture of pride and impertinence ;	22.41516794717219
She was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself ;	44.746704104284575
But there are two things that I want very much to know : one is , how much money your uncle has laid down , to bring it about ;	6.933073226549363
but that is what a governess will prevent , and if I had known your mother , I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one .	8.693211913811023
There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention , while she added , When I said that he improved on acquaintance , I did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement , but that from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood .	2.898067610034054
Colonel Forster is a sensible man , and will keep her out of any real mischief ;	22.90877242610496
The reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as I have given above .	15.046963987154452
Both changed colour , one looked white , the other red .	53.69533281330631
It had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town ;	16.840584745682992
but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended ;	56.04188533768471
Darcy !	13597.716288560492
Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far ;	182.93276980679664
though it had not occurred to me before .	126.92006177539189
to own the truth , with Wickham !	183.4738460516449
Her hopes were answered ;	873.1510774730008
He was my godfather , and excessively attached to me .	68.93004396227876
Well , well , said he , do not make yourself unhappy .	52.58379112189908
This is quite shocking !	875.5366098958821
How hard it is in some cases to be believed !	68.89917614345306
and he was always the sweetest-tempered , most generous-hearted , boy in the world .	29.648899452246148
and after observing Collins for a few moments , he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh .	7.699108142474985

and depend upon it , you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this , as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire .	6.218311669094095
it must be so , while he retains the use of his reason .	36.63724951348998
Vain , ignorant , idle , and absolutely uncontrouled !	95.64525075053155
but Jane happened to look round , and happened to smile : it was decided .	25.145017341282557
And is it really true ?	471.6776795740263
The letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so .	25.236984453372198
Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters .	13.524223900860871
Collins !	15916.861430491797
Without a governess you must have been neglected .	126.7684574716793
Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening , but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine , and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time .	4.277827618025087

for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her .	12.123322567119535
after honestly telling her what she thought , she thus went on : You are too sensible a girl , Lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are warned against it ;	5.778213961003828
And so , Darcy did every thing ;	184.39690423249456

said he , smiling .	886.2153350471918
Gardiner did not write again , till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster ;	25.15838481915762
But before they heard again from Gardiner , a letter arrived for their father , from a different quarter , from Collins ;	11.22890078583392
how acutely did she now feel it .	183.2912645300379
cried Jane .	4751.0788029920595
I never heard any thing so abominable .	183.99293104160637
It was at Sir William Lucas's , where a large party were assembled .	35.3167709209311
but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield , and leave the next generation to purchase .	3.228549475633255
Her father had most cruelly mortified her , by what he said of Darcy's indifference , and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that perhaps , instead of his seeing too little , she might have fancied too much .	3.834002761721273
and though feeling no reliance on her , could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved .	11.234254340354944
Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Bingley's name had been last mentioned between them ;	17.298037360300228
CHAPTER XVI .	4353.740372381362
Did you go by the village of Kympton ?	126.9119758668375
Bennet's expectations were fully answered .	473.83324968387916
Will you come and see me ?	285.61172831246864
1 .	10898.860396037358
As she pronounced these words , Darcy changed colour ;	91.83738513425952
They all paint tables , cover skreens and net purses .	68.88876388414933
But now we may be silent .	283.42900187763166
After a short silence , the lady first spoke .	96.05264029965745
But here , by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister's absence , I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized .	6.922608888694883
Elizabeth obeyed , and running into her own room for her parasol , attended her noble guest down stairs .	15.432375609914216
For about three years I heard little of him ;	91.43902927083862
Has your governess left you ?	474.24960150590704
but I was over-ruled , as I always am .	95.73318236444025
The family were assembled in the breakfast room , to receive them .	43.03917530227505
and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion .	91.57567436485968
Unless the elder brother is very sickly , I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds .	16.80241529948447
If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him ;	9.781146714327242
but so we all were .	471.61766773082417
Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew , but he had never seen any thing but affability in her .	11.550716593618475
Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had , from the distress of the moment , been led to make Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister ;	7.204576509295516
Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter , that Charlotte , really rejoicing in the match , was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over .	5.017036313486965
You are to understand , Miss Bennet , that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose ;	15.285220175617109
She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs .	53.6992936169039
The farewell between herself and Wickham was perfectly friendly ;	91.33489401897373
I wonder , said he , at the next opportunity of speaking , whether he is likely to be in this country much longer .	10.7856338355185
She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance , Hurst and Miss Bingley .	21.801001494907776
And , if I may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your lady possesses .	7.344807548608342
it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours , which the discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable ;	12.614578425153088
Let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers .	29.56714601661245
In comparing her recollection of Pemberley , with the minute description which Wickham could give , and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor , she was delighting both him and herself .	4.734435602421473
He was growing quite inattentive to other people , and wholly engrossed by her .	30.604010631876662
I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Darcy .	25.219136978663844
She had better have stayed at home , cried Elizabeth ;	68.9266475461714
On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn , your uncle had a most unexpected visitor .	17.83364050360643
and , turning to Elizabeth , said , Miss Eliza Bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room .	7.4808766302685585
It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both ;	36.628967114194246
Yes ;	11559.025432404986
The favour of your company has been much felt , I assure you .	36.63034990986514
We have heard nothing from town .	283.4273592077425
Really , Collins , cried Elizabeth with some warmth , you puzzle me exceedingly .	30.584230460984017
They are gone down to Newcastle , a place quite northward , it seems , and there they are to stay , I do not know how long .	8.518790012574213
Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather , which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Wickham ;	10.579888096199983
and , in short , as the time drew near , she would have been very sorry for any delay .	16.610413748710645
But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation , she made no answer .	21.83773536744678
Perhaps we might be deceived .	472.357018861332
the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father ;	17.305752867971055
Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there , that day ;	21.77393853854453
E9 .	13586.708929614973
One seems so forlorn without them .	282.96773252025656
I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever .	16.599776656005112
You need not send them word at Longbourn of my going , if you do not like it , for it will make the surprise the greater , when I write to them , and sign my name Lydia Wickham .	4.778927491783091
but he never distinguished her by any particular attention , and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourites .	3.597412440947627
Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure , and she was eagerly calling out , while her daughter read , Well , Jane , who is it from ?	9.15581451024758
I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more .	35.88667138676824
His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling .	182.97831599814833
but now as the first shock is over , shall I own that I long for your return ?	16.803333500345165
My faults , according to this calculation , are heavy indeed !	53.70691961355268
You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for resisting every repetition of it .	13.538485849240635
She practises very constantly .	872.8639835499257
She had very little notice from any but him .	91.4000218414925
In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley , whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose .	11.549640183136626
but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at Hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of and Collins's happiness ;	4.602784147244357
Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all ;	68.87435935390347
Upon the whole , I am much pleased with him .	75.23699399420646
Collins , you must send a servant with them .	91.66271355967436
It is a grievous affair to my poor girls , you must confess .	35.37334322680271
and when the carriage drove up to the door , the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces , and displayed itself over their whole bodies , in a variety of capers and frisks , was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome .	4.156862215764081
It was impossible to imagine ;	471.8297747705117
That is very true , replied Elizabeth , and I could easily forgive his pride , if he had not mortified mine .	13.30536591688831
The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial , and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded , as having passed at the Netherfield ball , and as confirming all his first disapprobation , could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers .	3.4349595226862975
If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room , I shall be very thankful ;	14.266402812323884
But in all , and in almost every line of each , there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style , and which , proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself , and kindly disposed towards every one , had been scarcely ever clouded .	3.1994436849435526
I saw them the night before last .	182.9129876873433
With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes , did Lydia , assisted by Kitty's hints and additions , endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn .	5.943515760666403
Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ?	43.19822348525287
I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women .	43.044975509418634
She would be in nobody's way , you know , in that part of the house .	24.971368244607604
Oh !	8965.45062507954
and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother , and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance , particularly grateful to the daughter .	6.563640307841982
the turning past , he was immediately before them .	91.41892912830274
They had frequently been staying with her in town .	91.54571169826887
They will take care not to outrun their income .	91.7280136723999
These two girls had been above an hour in the place , happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner , watching the sentinel on guard , and dressing a sallad and cucumber .	6.168444030990088
How you must have hated me after that evening ?	91.3611654082918
She is all affability and condescension , and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over .	8.781032464439498
If she heard me , it was by good luck , for I am sure she did not listen .	16.580353204425922
He smiled , looked handsome , and said many pretty things .	53.70065612780324
The very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour , and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of .	6.687963816715159
By this time she is actually with them !	126.27687856816146
Not these two or three years perhaps .	183.06828802218902
and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable .	9.098628262236765
It amazes me , I confess ;	282.3586037903365
Miss Bennet , do you know who I am ?	91.57030861040013
As they walked home , Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen ;	17.338117523320832
Its business office is located at 8<DATE> West , Salt Lake City , UT 84116 , ( 801 ) 596-1887 .	13.923065739494454
and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably , when the sound of horses drew their notice , and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street .	5.943657229269212
Supposing him to be attached to me , would my refusing to accept his hand , make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ?	9.205892182059277
That had his actions been what Wickham represented them , so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world ;	8.300720453450717
Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent ;	43.18546454091337
Dining out , said Bennet , that is very unlucky .	80.84981523138816
Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a depravity , to which the separation of two young persons , whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison .	2.4618523627528868
Charlotte tried to console her .	473.5287383739997
one meets it every where .	474.85357993752467
they are even impartial towards Miss King .	184.6337926727697
You shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very dreadful .	53.701612842314944
It may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement .	7.700010801396668
After lamenting it however at some length , she had the consolation of thinking that Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn , and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that , though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses .	3.014407160398766
For my part , I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody .	27.40710174638438
Mary , however , continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them .	15.02710207686114
I am always glad to get a young person well placed out .	43.04497550941859
She shook her head .	872.8639835499257
The park was very large , and contained great variety of ground .	43.03917530227505
what could she mean by it ?	283.17255396333
Darcy may hug himself .	873.2494250048192
The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her .	91.33489401897373
and I am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not .	33.229576312539145
It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing , said Bingley .	29.54477013606777
Most willingly .	4789.27318344388
But do not imagine that he is always here so often .	56.13998075296585
If you were sensible of your own good , you would not wish to quit the sphere , in which you have been brought up .	9.298198340383456
When I consider , she added , in a yet more agitated voice , that I might have prevented it !	15.52983751157688
The little Gardiners , attracted by the sight of a chaise , were standing on the steps of the house , as they entered the paddock ;	9.366713905816157
It keeps him in good humour , said she , and I am more obliged to you than I can express .	15.02642148401555
Say that urgent business calls us home immediately .	126.07739456675078
every body says that he is ate up with pride , and I dare say he had heard somehow that Long does not keep a carriage , and had come to the ball in a hack chaise .	5.199775044379671
But they did pass away , and and Gardiner , with their four children , did at length appear at Longbourn .	12.600503030184854
He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention .	43.03973758073568
Let me mend it for you .	283.362578112042
Her heart had been but slightly touched , and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice , had fortune permitted it .	7.725259804865498
I do think Long is as good a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls , and not at all handsome : I like them prodigiously .	6.354655697591006
On his quitting the room , she sat down , unable to support herself , and looking so miserably ill , that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her , or to refrain from saying , in a tone of gentleness and commiseration , Let me call your maid .	3.727261999842433
1813 .	15895.509420740158
Upon this signal , the youngest of her daughters put herself forward .	43.10139002945032
Bennet had many grievances to relate , and much to complain of .	43.17738383439728
You take delight in vexing me .	282.36793845088044
For my part , Bingley , I always keep servants that can do their own work ;	21.733775991790566
Darcy , you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner .	17.32798923507461
He owed a good deal in the town , but his debts of honour were still more formidable .	16.80359520899542
Darcy's shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict , gave her a keener sense of her sister's sufferings .	11.830626549726173
They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her , and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her , So , Miss Eliza , I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham !	5.204634824621828
yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week .	53.862574693791565
I must have employment and society .	282.93374345085925
It would be nothing ;	875.7513423617539
and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room .	53.95072793440249
I should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me .	35.443383905717305
No , no , you shall not deceive me .	96.29674109484647
that to be in the same room , the same party with him for so many hours together , might be more than I could bear , and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself .	4.9100988159738055
And then , said she , if that very improbable event should ever take place , I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself .	5.924385462340875
Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment ;	91.57233244155437
After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour , without hearing Miss Bingley's voice , Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family .	5.895026820213875
it had been written five days ago .	193.07827674008317
I do not know the particulars , but I know very well that Darcy is not in the least to blame , that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned , and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way .	2.7413632824218714
Yes , very handsome .	874.3364164695123
my uncle !	4759.982675743833
But in such cases as these , a good memory is unpardonable .	43.14821740145976
Darcy !	13597.716288560492
Collins made his declaration in form .	282.5423181007908
Lady Catherine rose also , and they turned back .	91.46444101660047
My good opinion once lost is lost for ever .	91.34839961648215
Send back your answer as soon as you can , and be careful to write explicitly .	23.12786303119682
The feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation .	7.78392267918338
They found Mary , as usual , deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature ;	18.99817679546532
CHAPTER XXI .	4747.787542098787
Their table was superlatively stupid .	472.0964291441105
Jane now came up .	873.575015882092
She then took a large house in Edward-street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings .	19.605498669458182
CHAPTER XIX .	4138.577761074046
and now , my dear Jane , what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business ?	8.237095805700822
And what arts did he use to separate them ?	91.52446994862692
Mary and Kitty have been very kind , and would have shared in every fatigue , I am sure , but I did not think it right for either of them .	7.475735301246384
cried Elizabeth , with the greatest satisfaction .	205.13486303834168
Again his astonishment was obvious ;	471.56144177488665
Why did not you all learn ?	282.75774442003564
Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy , though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Bingley's regard , and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it .	7.029361164938843
He was then , he said , on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her .	17.59890941640265
It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single .	43.13620763080725
At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies , by not asking them to dance , and I spoke to him twice myself , without receiving an answer .	6.236767840202876
Your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man I know ;	21.725280545489284
As it was certain , however , that somebody was coming , Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion , and walk away with him into the shrubbery .	5.581308419141308
There can be no doubt of that .	182.98713526718325
and besides all this , she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking , the tone of her voice , her address and expressions , or the word will be but half deserved .	4.734036103312243
Good bye .	4369.663431489112
Bingley arrived .	4749.4096157107715
Yes that is what makes it amusing .	183.00624784456934
yes ;	15987.501269610691
I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me ;	53.707575946191916
and from her correspondence with her sister , there was still less to be learnt for her letters to Kitty , though rather longer , were much too full of lines under the words to be made public .	4.782837804987013
but the latter half , which was dated a day later , and written in evident agitation , gave more important intelligence .	11.24091860406504
He knows where we live .	471.6336941039698
and , among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army .	11.514047767571867
In truth I must acknowledge that , with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage , I should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion , while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings .	4.775756877909426
You do not blame me , however , for refusing him ?	57.80472918101082
for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion , I should at present detest his very name , and wish him all manner of evil .	7.78479716496225
and from the observation of the day altogether , she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented .	14.133094393177728
I do not wish to avoid the walk .	126.28223517354733
What pin-money , what jewels , what carriages you will have !	53.712667798680656
Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl , and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose .	9.217797065086648
She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Forster , and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton , where the temptations must be greater than at home .	3.2260413346590915
but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others , and she had no opportunity of detaining them .	15.943002861606525
All Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away ;	68.97628876046569
I described , and enforced them earnestly .	182.9129876873433
for , of course , they were to have a son .	62.35913918551967
But is it certain , absolutely certain ?	182.92153389378294
Mr .	15895.509420740158
CHAPTER XVII .	4138.577761074046
She was not equal , however , to much conversation , and when Miss Bingley left them together , could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with .	5.638961331805977
so I will dictate , and you write for me .	69.00293396125757
The surprise of such an application was great indeed ;	91.33489401897373
but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much .	35.452399619207696
He has been accused of many faults at different times ;	68.99111823197087
Have you had any flirting ?	475.5764599046556
and luckily for the others , the business of love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company .	16.769926341997618
What shall we do with him ?	282.4502899266855
First , that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion ;	20.175544635143865
and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , I hope , acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Wickham .	10.831617434890303
For your sake , turning to Charlotte , I am glad of it ;	38.83444688065697
Design !	15895.509420740158
She is a very good kind of girl , I believe .	56.33910415240672
Every savage can dance .	874.3743526923491
At length , every idea seemed to fail him ;	91.89087386465727
Oh !	8965.45062507954
END OF VOL .	1852.072171128788
F5 .	15895.509420740158
I have heard , indeed , that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two .	22.496322971665293
I will only say farther , that from what passed that evening , my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me before , to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection .	3.825565202056694
Catherine , weak-spirited , irritable , and completely under Lydia's guidance , had been always affronted by their advice ;	15.009175861060113
The moral will be perfectly fair .	282.3552787512534
and she lay awake two whole hours , endeavouring to make them out .	35.31957818854457
F3 , this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' , WITH NO OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND , EXPRESS OR IMPLIED , INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE .	5.225181582021877
Let me advise you then , my dear Sir , to console yourself as much as possible , to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever , and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence .	4.34681799982766
how would she have behaved ?	472.7397147234852
There , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard .	9.340443495564807
She could think of nothing but of Wickham , and of what he had told her , all the way home ;	14.443396296150484
There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley , that could provoke his ridicule , or disgust him into silence ;	12.292180014171365
and the possibility of her deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret .	29.559843869307986
Her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely recollected her interest in the affair , and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth , seemed to have fixed them on her more , and more cheerfully .	3.929993587605989
It does not necessarily follow that a deep , intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours .	11.510504739680561
His sense of her inferiority of its being a degradation of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination , were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding , but was very unlikely to recommend his suit .	3.7272536178486337
and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged , as by no means unpleasing , though it could not be exactly defined .	7.727293206081365
or at least , by the predominance of virtue , atone for those casual errors , under which she would endeavour to class , what Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance .	4.8328759809944595
Colonel Fitzwilliam , who led the way , was about thirty , not handsome , but in person and address most truly the gentleman .	9.808550218801289
and till the morrow , their going was deferred .	91.32939756883732
Anxious and uneasy , the period which passed in the drawing-room , before the gentlemen came , was wearisome and dull to a degree , that almost made her uncivil .	6.7634431625318685
I have nothing to say against him ;	193.0332678842691
She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged .	25.23674869474403
Gardiner was surprised and concerned ;	472.0964291441105
They are my old friends .	472.9862852944433
And that I suppose is one of your sisters .	91.34257250110858
My mother means well ;	878.550987464302
I shall like it of all things .	183.1376054435776
I do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to .	6.0548106958982535
Have a little compassion on my nerves .	183.4738460516449
And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman , Ma'am ?	43.22557655329877
It was not all settled before Monday : as soon as it was , the express was sent off to Longbourn .	13.284614140141814
Their manners are not equal to his .	183.0801985162523
His behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire .	15.529156389135652
CHAPTER IV .	4138.577761074046
It is done , however , and it was done for the best .	41.74809975223758
and all that I can hope in this case is , that she is deceived herself .	23.184083690888535
and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate .	21.727108927886324
and with a more smiling solemnity replied , It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably .	9.573497317296962
But Jane could think with certainty on only one point , that Bingley , if he had been imposed on , would have much to suffer when the affair became public .	6.682133227482861
She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind .	29.564148151690212
It is a nice long walk , and Darcy has never seen the view .	29.596632686695663
our authority was too good .	471.56144177488665
Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the good will of Hurst and Miss Bingley ;	31.463687516299565
He has many friends , and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing .	13.904107381830144
She talked on , therefore , without interruption from any of them till they were joined by Collins , who entered with an air more stately than usual , and on perceiving whom , she said to the girls , Now , I do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your tongues , and let Collins and me have a little conversation together .	2.5874794534743204
that was impossible ;	1855.3582407576664
It cannot be concealed from any one .	184.00705061109656
Denny addressed them directly , and entreated permission to introduce his friend , Wickham , who had returned with him the day before from town , and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps .	4.7286478251695705
but perhaps you would like to read it .	126.08920579026261
Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance .	91.32606463305149
Oh !	8965.45062507954
said Jane faintly smiling , You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , I could not hesitate .	11.103283383733485
They were soon gone again , rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise , and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Bennet's civilities .	6.356087488362101
She held out her hand ;	471.6152006322248
the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door , and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual .	7.06390601938631
Bennet protested against any description of finery .	182.99319233797297
and pride has often been his best friend .	126.08232441121416
Elizabeth related to Jane the next day , what had passed between Wickham and herself .	31.052639387235345
When the tea-things were removed , and the card tables placed , the ladies all rose , and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him , when all her views were overthrown , by seeing him fall a victim to her mother's rapacity for whist players , and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party .	2.9102666269950666
They were to be off as soon as possible .	93.94472974443772
I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life .	36.76583742972235
Others of the party were now applied to .	126.07739456675078
I will leave him to himself .	282.72909474173576
How good it was in you , my dear Bennet !	73.7962183711748
in half a minute the letter was unfolded again , and collecting herself as well as she could , she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham , and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence .	3.996213400322123
When the engagement was for home , some of the officers always made part of it , of which officers Wickham was sure to be one ;	8.30920372653049
till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante .	16.839468084160746
E6 .	15895.509420740158
Bennet invited him to dine with them ;	182.99319233797297
You need not distress yourself .	471.6466798211467
and he was more communicative , and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him .	21.734316787759763
What do you mean , Bennet , by talking in this way ?	43.285437477661084
A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features , but he said not a word , and Elizabeth , though blaming herself for her own weakness , could not go on .	6.795478445869756
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement , the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law .	4.573617583012267
In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name ;	91.35200710679793
Elizabeth took up some needlework , and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion .	13.525264130759023
His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive ;	54.19764150248734
With great energy ;	1854.31419677475
there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day .	56.30180655863459
Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ;	12.304661234785812
She is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and I have no opinion of her .	26.919961721776897
Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit , and threw back the praise on her sister's warm affection .	16.83048664861651
My visit was not long , as Caroline and Hurst were going out .	35.311957831048225
They will never be distressed for money .	183.83380321144256
for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial .	25.149622673875697
True .	14555.1982975329
your feelings , I know , will bestow it unwillingly , but I demand it of your justice .	17.294763648772197
I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one ;	53.811464535279
My dear Jane , Collins is a conceited , pompous , narrow-minded , silly man ;	25.653339606886107
If he does not come to me , then , said she , I shall give him up for ever .	15.95460231744512
I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his ill-treatment ;	21.777860447551067
Well , now let us be quite comfortable and snug , and talk and laugh all the way home .	15.698064672006408
and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world .	30.546449483551832

Sir William had been delighted with him .	183.78649437883897
and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair .	91.57567436485968
said Gardiner .	4751.986131603042
The business was therefore soon settled .	282.3552787512534
and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated , I felt no doubt of their happiness together .	12.099880276166134
and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings .	91.65185088429212
but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention .	35.307578478466574
She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there , and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you .	9.206264567460964
that I had been with you , you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone .	19.590172519196305
but , with many expressions of concern , he confessed himself engaged elsewhere .	35.34873350149622
Wickham had received his commission before he left London , and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight .	11.58000336793126
I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn .	25.148087922213723
My objections to the marriage were not merely those , which I last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside , in my own case ;	6.353524464774535
Sure he will not leave London before he has found them .	53.69533281330631
Her aunt assured her that she was ;	192.989024383017
How it could occur a second time therefore was very odd !	53.71354201991081
it was evident that he was very much in love with her .	47.142964616934684
I know we dine with four and twenty families .	91.43685018303371
He still loves me , and we are engaged .	91.3363258970804
and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers .	21.755915247002182
Bingley of course returned with him to dinner ;	126.16442996836406
Its completion depended on others .	474.24960150590704
It pains me to offend you .	282.3586037903365
And if I had not a letter to write myself , I might sit by you , and admire the evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did .	6.5448341241121275
though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible , I instantly resolved on setting off for this place , that I might make my sentiments known to you .	5.241547209983844
His apparent partiality had subsided , his attentions were over , he was the admirer of some one else .	15.868292797077867
but for your sakes , we would do any thing .	68.8800050922285
This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife ;	15.028295438707637
I who knew what he was .	282.33513186395595
All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes .	68.97628876046569
There I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it ;	53.71385335711009
That will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable ;	68.90196004633508
Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ;	68.87435935390347
He did every thing best in the world ;	127.19911783154684
Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these , what would have been her sensations ?	8.911513698166326
Bennet and Kitty walked off , and as soon as they were gone Collins began .	28.628487924314516
Not that I have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body .	43.54849893686917
Miss Bingley told me , said Jane , that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance .	19.380734190508335
she was dying to know what could be his meaning and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him ?	14.270048955991122
I wish I might take this for a compliment ;	91.83464858540626
My father and Maria are to come to me in March , added Charlotte , and I hope you will consent to be of the party .	9.379195192152459
I saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it ;	17.58986528537889
We were always good friends ;	475.1356690632
The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature , must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance ;	8.299433831416374
This was praise , of all others most extraordinary , most opposite to her ideas .	26.035633182360957
The Gardiners staid only one night at Longbourn , and set off the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement .	10.988925975444022
She was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia , and , removed from the influence of Lydia's example , she became , by proper attention and management , less irritable , less ignorant , and less insipid .	4.581872422497519
My dear father , I congratulate you .	183.13186255363124
and turning round , he looked for a moment at Elizabeth , till catching her eye , he withdrew his own and coldly said , She is tolerable ;	7.327827909662955
He does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from Darcy more than once , but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only .	6.818026674444943
He made her an offer in this very room , and she refused him .	29.54490876701647
Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase , and listened with all her heart ;	25.14584145195857
It was some time , however , before a smile could be extorted from Jane .	25.99495016951125
Sometimes one officer , sometimes another had been her favourite , as their attentions raised them in her opinion .	15.009175861060113
and , therefore , abruptly changing the conversation , talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage .	17.896727944154513
My uncle and aunt and I were to go together ;	68.89015060068674

for on first hearing it , Bennet sat quite still , and unable to utter a syllable .	19.580978418946206
I never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter .	19.94578555051351

for Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law , that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion .	4.531994723684859
] PRIDE AND PREJUDICE : A Novel .	182.9046321206164
You will not , I hope , consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family , my dear Madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter's favour , without having paid yourself and Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf .	3.533758584667528
I have been used to consider poetry as the food of love , said Darcy .	25.21585543822053
She had never heard of his having had any relations , except a father and mother , both of whom had been dead many years .	9.089827229501527
Or in other words , you are determined to have him .	55.92991835555153
and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again , when Bingley , who as well as the other had sat down , suddenly rose , and whispering a few words to her sister , ran out of the room .	4.778712549069172
and secondly , of my room .	282.3340390589578

A little .	4747.787542098787
On the contrary , there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks .	29.606359595382976
and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly , and live in so rational a manner , as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten .	7.785811263566924
and I should be miserable to forfeit it .	126.16257801829201

It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected .	14.488607473433756
and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day .	33.494538798091774
Well , all I know is , that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him .	15.059602964744382
And what claims has Lydia , what attractions has she beyond youth , health , and good humour , that could make him for her sake , forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well ?	5.1017172923159535
May I ask to what these questions tend ?	126.07739456675078
They walked on , without knowing in what direction .	91.34643824464112
CHAPTER VII .	4138.577761074046
It was a fortnight since Bennet had been down stairs , but on this happy day , she again took her seat at the head of her table , and in spirits oppressively high .	5.440588318026212
She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on which there could be no difference of sentiment .	11.523810990070412
then some time or other we shall be happy to hear you .	44.72525668522279
causes which , though still existing , and existing to an equal degree in both instances , I had myself endeavoured to forget , because they were not immediately before me .	6.352894638890466
And can you likewise declare , that there is no foundation for it ?	37.98282767517205
I knew it myself , as it was known to Miss Bingley , but her brother is even yet ignorant of it .	11.694843215178153
As long as she stays there , it is all very well .	43.05297452193775
No arguments shall be wanting on my part , that can alleviate so severe a misfortune ;	22.418392557222276
No I cannot talk of books in a ball-room ;	91.37300104083818
I mention it , because it is the living which I ought to have had .	27.761401264582236
I write without any intention of paining you , or humbling myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , cannot be too soon forgotten ;	6.473133578153585
and her calling here was prodigiously civil !	183.2702869064239
She danced next with an officer , and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham , and of hearing that he was universally liked .	10.04822323791544
A thorough , determined dislike of me a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy .	15.013336146342368
Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister , who joined her with a cheerful look , which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors , than Elizabeth .	5.487385378182744
Which do you mean ?	872.7545377705296
Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in Section 4 , Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation .	5.842219461407934
But before she had been three minutes in her own room , her mother followed her .	22.82864772923112
And when you have given your ball , she added , I shall insist on their giving one also .	16.854199202892264
If you received the work on a physical medium , you must return the medium with your written explanation .	15.444481026611001
We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us , said Gardiner , but perhaps to the Lakes .	14.133412000420426
But the case is this .	472.8940756635237
1 .	10898.860396037358
I believe her to be both in a great degree , replied Wickham ;	36.73875662238599
I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow , in comparison with myself , I should not pay him half so much deference .	7.940638418541823
And do you really love him quite well enough ?	91.8097814674407
He has heartily forgiven me now .	282.9594779820129
Yes , indeed , cried Bennet , offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood .	23.887800665009316
My aunt told me so herself on Saturday .	126.80167513761295
As it principally concerns yourself , you ought to know its contents .	43.05297452193775
You are not going to introduce yourself to Darcy ?	91.41701807147977
Something very much to the purpose of course .	126.07739456675078
The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family .	25.208565095423335
She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither ;	53.73369858695877
I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place .	22.664402438569486
but he saw only the father .	282.99866001611207
It would be dreadful !	875.7513423617539
Everything wore a happier aspect .	471.56144177488665
their minds were more vacant than their sisters' , and when nothing better offered , a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening ;	5.941812974758335
I told you so from the first , you may remember .	56.137974999172314
The gentlemen did approach ;	872.8811074345388
They had not been long together , before Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her ;	14.509188670329063
But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was .	53.84397873107505
and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another , might be remarked , he meant to make enquiries at Clapham .	7.2887856790947545
Were it known to the rest of my family , I should not have merely my own gratitude to express .	15.835385862388987
If it was to be secret , said Jane , say not another word on the subject .	20.478276941624376
The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn ;	182.92503594593404
and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying there too .	6.5502355485417905
she could not but say , after a moment's deliberation , I am not .	32.79477093136854
and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her , she dared not pronounce .	11.228638582268742
and what is to divide them ?	299.1224946643616
The two youngest of the family , Catherine and Lydia , were particularly frequent in these attentions ;	21.599011213186042
I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least .	37.57256071648676
I London : Printed for T Egerton , Military Library , Whitehall .	43.03712796264888
for , what with her board and pocket allowance , and the continual presents in money , which passed to her , through her mother's hands , Lydia's expences had been very little within that sum .	5.0212563783765845
Dearest Lizzy , I hardly know what I would write , but I have bad news for you , and it cannot be delayed .	10.481771901754708
It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ;	29.596632686695663
No , not at all .	503.38870376265544
You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking , and thinking for your approbation alone .	15.01036952683973
Come as soon as you can on the receipt of this .	58.47217092139217
he introduced us to his sister .	284.4228385630913
Aye because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield , and he could not help answering her ;	15.046762596124418
Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth : My dearest Lizzy , I FIND myself very unwell this morning , which , I suppose , is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday .	4.302510262922976
and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome , discontented or too poor , she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences , silence their complaints , and scold them into harmony and plenty .	4.503362056536765
but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear .	36.6723787509244
Lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how much he will give her .	15.597192858876014
Elizabeth was delighted .	1854.592280176145
The wish of procuring her regard , which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire , could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this .	7.34641494808643
But it is always so .	475.32273257616754
I did not know before , that I had two daughters on the brink of matrimony .	23.978578271535486
And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment .	6.778346498759047
but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled , and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with .	5.631016676611309
But so we all do .	471.61294093744067
May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment , or are the result of previous study ?	11.50985053443852
But he is , beyond all comparison , the most agreeable man I ever saw and if he becomes really attached to me I believe it will be better that he should not .	5.845640733554683
how shall I bear so much happiness !	183.2912645300379
She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia , with anxious parade , walk up to her mother's right hand , and hear her say to her eldest sister , Ah !	5.947122479834573
They were natural and just .	472.35909119365556
Denny and Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Philips's house , and then made their bows , in spite of Miss Lydia's pressing entreaties that they would come in , and even in spite of Philips' throwing up the parlour window , and loudly seconding the invitation .	3.4267229207300014
and if she accepted any refreshment , seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family .	7.36551318624715
He did not talk to me of his own arts , said Fitzwilliam smiling .	29.72616400444446
Pray do not talk of that odious man .	126.3721026789964
It is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half-hour's acquaintance , as to a real , strong attachment .	12.283697758890693
F 1 .	4743.677376410631
every body had been most kind and attentive to him , there had been no formality , no stiffness , he had soon felt acquainted with all the room ;	7.0762853811211235
Let me first see how he behaves , said she ;	69.06481795283676
and I should have gone so all the way , if Kitty had not been sick ;	22.420174540208492
but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time , she had the same story to repeat every day .	12.271033506326697
Your daughter Elizabeth , it is presumed , will not long bear the name of Bennet , after her elder sister has resigned it , and the chosen partner of her fate , may be reasonably looked up to , as one of the most illustrious personages in this land .	3.565447801447262
I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this , and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time , without being informed that she was very accomplished .	5.63123207198105
On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared ;	21.72588478590489
72 of La Belle Assemblee 1 st July 1815 ] PRIDE PREJUDICE .	43.035708093730584
In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty , who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments , to make their appearance before .	7.89067134810905
Lakes , mountains , and rivers , shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations ;	25.98720537438182
But surely , said she , I may enter his county with impunity , and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me .	9.280141631269476
He took the hint , and when Mary had finished her second song , said aloud , That will do extremely well , child .	9.557004023075454
and when we got to the George , I do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too .	4.239574884389016
Do not you , Darcy ?	473.0448922421293
The garden in which stands my humble abode , is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park , her ladyship's residence .	11.229000596766417
I shall go distracted .	874.1999772153572
If you were aware , said Elizabeth , of the very great disadvantage to us all , which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded and imprudent manner ;	7.2822459248042595
Elizabeth was disgusted , and even Miss Bennet was shocked .	68.92705956107727
You both did as much as you could , in planning the marriage .	37.98138241746836
And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate ;	15.056823939361982
There's for you !	1852.072171128788
my dear , continued Bennet , I am quite delighted with him .	48.683432409008624
Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding ;	36.620759639580555
Elizabeth made no objection ;	883.914129632405
did you admire me for my impertinence ?	182.9046321206164
The officers may not be so pleasant in General 's regiment .	55.93468946972384
By this time , my dearest sister , you have received my hurried letter ;	29.575131658353694
But not before they went to Brighton ?	182.92153389378294
When that business was over , he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for the indulgence of some music .	15.435098621754495
How much of good or evil must be done by him !	56.15505085874776
only in different lines .	872.7545377705296
Elizabeth , who had a letter to write , went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea ;	14.27564523240343
I think she will .	875.6639836630721
It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane , said she .	30.70392535195407
Miss Bingley offered her the carriage , and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it , when Jane testified such concern in parting with her , that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present .	3.610822542106875
Did Darcy give you his reasons for this interference ?	91.50792920719019
her uncle and aunt stopped also , and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building , the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road , which led behind it to the stables .	4.7079806536287725
She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others ;	55.934043991993775
I cannot make him out .	472.2713802486462
Then , observed Elizabeth , you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman .	17.354466823579223
but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me , was a strong inducement .	16.81206821551849
She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her , but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea ;	9.560335864471107
and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society , and from our connection with Rosings , the frequent means of varying the humble home scene , I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome .	3.549675745939061
and he might imagine , from my father's behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that he would do as little , and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter .	3.0491711623561075
The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage , explained to her that , by his wife at least , if not by himself , such a hope was cherished .	5.778428814838145
It ought to be so ;	502.3049780458596
Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane .	53.69533281330631
that proud and repulsive as were his manners , she had never , in the whole course of their acquaintance , an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together , and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways , seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits .	2.8228154233229863
Do you talk by rule then , while you are dancing ?	53.81656623713001
Oh , lord !	1719.2025306586143
But , alas !	1855.2030322884725
Your ladyship wants Darcy to marry your daughter ;	126.16695397791044
CHAPTER IX .	4138.577761074046
but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way .	53.69947538206595
It may do very well for the others , replied Bingley ;	55.935154427640775
and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke , joined to the circumstance itself , and many of the circumstances of the preceding day , opened to them a new idea on the business .	5.216938007038255
or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ?	35.35618680406556
Had I been in love , I could not have been more wretchedly blind .	35.15770397205575
But still he would be her husband .	182.92153389378294
He had found the law a most unprofitable study , and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained , if I would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for , and I could not have forgotten my revered father's intentions .	2.765583935180351
I must have my share in the conversation , if you are speaking of music .	26.019411736076655
but her sister's was involved in it , as she thought he must be sensible himself .	22.48997276829591
They shook hands with great cordiality ;	282.3998896388649
Do not charge a fee for access to , viewing , displaying , performing , copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works unless you comply with paragraph 1 .	7.486234202659621
and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance , of his having ten thousand a year .	11.514699188447869
There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer ;	36.65760670869599
and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him , as now , when all love must be vain .	10.988583916948711
Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants .	30.587288639973753
The marriage of a daughter , which had been the first object of her wishes , since Jane was sixteen , was now on the point of accomplishment , and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials , fine muslins , new carriages , and servants .	3.4692728078717305
nor could she think , without a smile , of what her ladyship's indignation would have been .	19.615605938467723
and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out .	7.862945663298878
Every thing being settled between them , Darcy's next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in Gracechurch-street the evening before I came home .	6.439420503196343
In as short a time as Collins's long speeches would allow , every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both ;	10.331527386349828
But do not be cast down .	283.82449111231784
I was so vexed to see him stand up with her ;	53.745383730279244
She is grown so brown and coarse !	183.11164061086836
I am very , very sorry .	283.6592865371856
He now wished it more than ever .	182.92834490122445
and in farther justification of Darcy , she could not but allow that Bingley , when questioned by Jane , had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair ;	7.904393252209684
The time fixed for the beginning of their Northern tour was now fast approaching ;	30.58644809221283
But what , said she , after a pause , can have been his motive ?	30.508609987123048
they are married !	1877.4164076431437
cried Elizabeth , I am excessively diverted .	200.6452134341618
Could there be finer symptoms ?	473.296294121307
The possibility of his having really endured such unkindness , was enough to interest all her tender feelings ;	17.29580866379148
he was moving that way ;	472.0964291441105
but with a moment's recollection and a returning smile , replied , that he had formerly seen him often ;	16.681102485104418
And what am I to do on the occasion ?	95.85303947146998
You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns , said Darcy in a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour .	10.920258458582893
I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction , and nobody but a governess can give it .	9.502002289797463
Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth .	91.38490565965999
I expected you to stay two months .	192.93041436051453
Well , but now for my news : it is about dear Wickham ;	35.348426296284224
It was a journey of only twenty-four miles , and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch-street by noon .	11.525870483399617
They have both , said she , been deceived , I dare say , in some way or other , of which we can form no idea .	9.537739925128582
Nor was her respect for him , though it made her more quiet , at all likely to make her more elegant .	11.249639412150735
she cried .	4102.7129695329595
Collins moreover adds , I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad business has been so well hushed up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place , should be so generally known .	4.359263166996596
and , as he spoke , he left the room , fatigued with the raptures of his wife .	17.302121788415292
He cannot afford it .	872.9016340513282
and after relating the circumstances , she thus went on : I am now convinced , my dear aunt , that I have never been much in love ;	8.193882242182028
I knew that Wickham ought not to be a clergyman .	77.23329820558139
And they are really to be married !	182.94278039473133
A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other , and out of their three months' acquaintance they had been intimate two .	7.347564958288605
Your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as I said before , they had a great deal of talk together .	10.298130320792493
a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure and affection and intelligence , which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad .	6.241799897289703
Elizabeth went away with her head full of him .	91.33824067289287
and she was perpetually either making some inquiry , or looking at his page .	29.602236450926224
But the horror of what might possibly happen , almost took from me my faculties .	25.180641546543246
At any rate , she cannot grow many degrees worse , without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life .	10.051338445754867
Can you deny that you have done it ?	132.75933395015227
Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother's .	91.33824067289287
You could not have started a more happy idea , since you will not take comfort in mine .	17.64706826706311
No more have I , said Bennet ;	183.01310093230205
Jane was by no means better .	329.0312668949853
Why , at that rate , you will have been here only six weeks .	30.69362551659952
I had not an idea of it .	184.25760354643663
I never saw such a woman .	299.71404176459083
Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid , who continued , though slowly , to mend ;	10.824379895789274
In nine cases out of ten , a woman had better shew more affection than she feels .	18.998932140873503
Elizabeth would wonder , and probably would blame her ;	91.33824067289287
The present unhappy state of the family , rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary ;	16.12531055938133
Darcy took her place by her niece , and they walked on together .	36.627832096129914
But from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed , respecting each circumstance , I shall hope to be in future secured , when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read .	4.286844399246302
and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning .	16.802798548425134
but shortly recovering himself , advanced towards the party , and spoke to Elizabeth , if not in terms of perfect composure , at least of perfect civility .	7.327992588838089
I know it all ;	874.3430969941132
La !	13586.708929614973
I know of nobody that is coming I am sure , unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in , and I hope my dinners are good enough for her .	7.551860950087443
You must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm works .	5.505318386040534
Elizabeth could not but be pleased , could not but triumph .	59.8959752647327
In spite of this amendment , however , she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn , desiring her mother to visit Jane , and form her own judgment of her situation .	5.967320115850304
is not this an agreeable surprise ?	282.32115989635025
He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be , and unconsciously closed his book .	9.784055241883886
But we considered it , we talked of it as impossible .	56.18623300876361
I can hardly write for laughing .	283.0381011327825
Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment , before their approach was announced by the door-bell , and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room .	6.5671133179793495
Her aunt now called her to look at a picture .	68.89391603519981
CHAPTER XI .	4353.740372381362
Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Bennet .	36.616905525906006
Come be quick , be quick !	283.79608068693244
She could neither wonder nor condemn , but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom , afforded no palliation of her distress .	8.305977267231075
Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh , said Elizabeth .	45.95065622627832
Five daughters successively entered the world , but yet the son was to come ;	30.58423046098403
I do not know when I have been more shocked , said she .	36.66817086978761
Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object .	184.1461578195132
I know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you ;	19.010438046387655
Your attendance upon her , has been too much for you .	53.726742415995965
I am sick of Bingley , cried his wife .	98.29129154440523
How can you be so silly , cried her mother , as to think of such a thing , in all this dirt !	11.864333460582982
That is a failing indeed !	472.4907099354028
The Foundation makes no representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United States .	15.432036339975937
but that Charlotte could encourage him , seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself , and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum , and she could not help crying out , Engaged to Collins !	3.651352494113995
Had they been only ten minutes sooner , they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination , for it was plain that he was that moment arrived , that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage .	4.717817245283358
Do not be afraid of my running into any excess , of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will .	12.296316540058015
Certainly , Sir ;	1862.9833964638603
Elizabeth , feeling really anxious , was determined to go to her , though the carriage was not to be had ;	13.273400552287766
or in other words , to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more .	19.599967292292877
I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that .	35.60990885821265
Sir William only smiled .	878.2287942620416
and his son will be just like him just as affable to the poor .	29.602956986469096
She seems a very pleasant young woman , said Bingley .	68.8797573713175
but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature , as the compliment deserved .	13.680833740316528
but I am an idle fellow , and though I have not many , I have more than I ever look into .	12.00309840051159
Now I am quite happy , said she , for you will be as happy as myself .	22.702948649523137
but amongst other causes of disquiet , she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour ;	10.33047687727638
It was a large , handsome , stone building , standing well on rising ground , and backed by a ridge of high woody hills ;	8.896526373497869
she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion , five and twenty years ago .	19.003175359133195
it was a better sized room , and had a pleasanter aspect ;	44.80320802222107
Do not you know that Collins wants to marry Lizzy ?	69.02324464945525
You are uniformly charming !	874.0586526558463
org Section 4 .	1852.072171128788
Elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them .	5.679277139905456
We have reason to imagine that his aunt , lady Catherine de Bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye .	10.397990500544337
For what do we live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ?	12.6085985848674
but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley .	126.08920579026261
Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display ;	55.92991835555153
When I have a house of my own , I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library .	14.689198740140338
But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away ;	69.00811473622989
but respecting his abilities , and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself , she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook , and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which , in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children , was so highly reprehensible .	2.9808946299372048
She read , with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension , and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes .	4.6443270410236055
To Gardiner , Wickham had one means of affording pleasure , unconnected with his general powers .	21.72259364513727
It is not of peculiar , but of general evils , which I am now complaining .	22.882068404024526
and I am happy to say , there will be some little money , even when all his debts are discharged , to settle on my niece , in addition to her own fortune .	5.950975357783917
This is the consequence you see , Madam , of marrying a daughter , said Elizabeth .	21.808799396626036
and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday , could have made such a Friday , Saturday , Sunday and Monday , endurable to Kitty and Lydia .	8.047201072034957
On reaching the house , they were shewn through the hall into the saloon , whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer .	10.583738883461669
Wickham only shook his head .	472.27931004825064
where else can they be so well concealed ?	126.7684574716793
This roused a general astonishment ;	471.83633721714693
said she .	4174.740194871325
and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be as well to be silent .	7.7837097532676465
But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you , who is very pretty , and I dare say , very agreeable .	10.381898608715447
but when questioned by him Denny denied knowing any thing of their plan , and would not give his real opinion about it .	11.004190556265375
When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure , she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment .	12.602934372363523
He must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to live on .	11.22909490336294
and that his character was by no means so faulty , nor Wickham's so amiable , as they had been considered in Hertfordshire .	11.86686915603819
Till I have your disposition , your goodness , I never can have your happiness .	25.206824411739543
I do not like to boast of my own child , but to be sure , Jane one does not often see any body better looking .	8.924568737434681
and when they next met , he looked at her only to criticise .	37.440753895877705
Were it for nothing but his love of you , I must always have esteemed him ;	21.791135352191375
his formal civility was just what it had been , and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family .	7.068123204870306
and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents .	69.01757071399392
but , alas !	1856.9031640162682
This invaluable friend was a very young woman , and very lately married .	36.62926206047642
Of whom does Jane ever think ill ?	183.26256978913838
The faces of both , however , were tolerably calm ;	71.93020670502521
I am only ashamed of his asking so little .	91.34966479764596
F3 .	16070.241809748964
Your uncle !	4749.575893789339
but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme .	283.122169851285
I never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses .	36.11273109985257
I told my sister Philips so the other day .	91.71118579531765
It is useless to talk of it .	183.00071728060837
If we thought alike of Miss Bingley , replied Jane , your representation of all this , might make me quite easy .	12.095784546537445
and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give the praise where it was due .	5.216640649102829
Did not you ?	1858.2232053608598
It must be an amusing study .	285.123218843204
and after a short silence Bennet began repeating her thanks to Bingley for his kindness to Jane , with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy .	8.22615995709685
He is the kind of man , indeed , to whom I should never dare refuse any thing , which he condescended to ask .	10.289268779435199
that abominable Darcy !	1855.3582407576664
What an excellent father you have , girls , said she , when the door was shut .	23.071683470577064
Does she live near you , sir ?	183.9845261424681
I see no occasion for that .	300.68635392933044
Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty , but she smiled too much .	35.379663098352
She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable .	10.330456379242683
but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood , and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess .	7.0641707172043295
and when he did speak , it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety , not a pleasure to himself .	8.303540497523658
but on the third , her repining was over , and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once , on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere .	4.9881906043703585
and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds .	7.3413166157915715
Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you , and wants him to marry Miss Darcy .	16.594257152046076
and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice .	4.038731462264307
With them he is remarkably agreeable .	282.57744400285765
I never met with anybody who delighted me so much .	72.03280350310958
CHAPTER VII .	4138.577761074046
Why must their marriage be private ?	282.75774442003564
I speak nothing but the truth .	282.33513186395595
The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart ;	43.03917530227505
If Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin , why is not he to make another choice ?	12.282416555077555
Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight , when she should enter the room .	43.21906651055367
In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society .	35.368564186005976
cried Elizabeth .	3961.228037884354
and what with the Philipses , the Lucases , and the officers , there was not a day without its engagement .	13.464734147601748
I am sorry you think so ;	283.3646125682347
There are a few things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works even without complying with the full terms of this agreement .	10.561338640189398
On that head , therefore , I shall be uniformly silent ;	62.18525078823862
and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust , naturally inclined my father to be of service to him , and on George Wickham , who was his god-son , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed .	4.777862417744369
You persist , then , in supposing his sisters influence him .	53.70161284231499
The surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great ;	15.889822050326547
Ten thousand a year , and very likely more !	102.91329746182616
It was first broken by Annesley , a genteel , agreeable-looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse , proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others ;	5.2162337332945485
Lady Catherine observed , after dinner , that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits , and immediately accounting for it herself , by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon , she added , But if that is the case , you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer .	3.019368825278915
His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention , the first to listen and to pity , the first to be admired ;	5.487478201193413
I cannot but wonder , however , at her having any such fears now , because , if he had at all cared about me , we must have met long , long ago .	5.686649734225191
What will Wickham say ?	879.9419092276165
Elizabeth , though she did not credit above half of what was said , believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister's ruin still more certain ;	7.821399487345175
And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice ?	91.34257250110858
Another time , Lizzy , said her mother , I would not dance with him , if I were you .	16.014582536727925
She had ventured only one glance at Darcy .	126.18678989417538
My dear Lizzy , they must have passed within ten miles of us .	35.62094074565046
His affection for her soon sunk into indifference ;	126.12455676745942
but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty .	59.932123026425614
Kitty simpered and smiled , and hoped her turn was coming soon .	44.79946506361069
and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another , and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be .	7.329384238667681
What did Colonel Forster say ?	471.79674056764355
and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths , quite mistake the matter .	16.802798548425134
But to expose the former faults of any person , without knowing what their present feelings were , seemed unjustifiable .	13.923709022991412
Not so much as I could wish , Sir ;	102.9930977860134
Both sisters were uncomfortable enough .	471.56144177488665
she cried .	4102.7129695329595
Pray do , my dear Miss Lucas , she added in a melancholy tone , for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me , I am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves .	4.860399420435903
With no expectation of pleasure , but with the strongest curiosity , Elizabeth opened the letter , and to her still increasing wonder , perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper , written quite through , in a very close hand .	4.0403783832463835
Ever since I have known it , I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it .	13.123199127577644
Nobody can tell what I suffer !	282.32115989634974
Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister ;	53.8159148630032
Very much .	4761.404895261674
I do not deserve it .	472.53676515777505
Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman , and he was thinking of her with some complacency , when thus accosted by Miss Bingley , I can guess the subject of your reverie .	5.596999643093868
He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room .	13.597630779847215
On finding Bennet , Elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words , May I hope , Madam , for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth , when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ?	3.0087125800033347
Kitty and me were to spend the day there , and Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening ;	12.613875848939456
Darcy bowed .	4747.039936628027
but her spirits returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be duped , by the sister at least .	13.564773796909373
Where shall you change horses ?	474.85357993752467
We all love to instruct , though we can teach only what is not worth knowing .	21.721914629920384
They attacked him in various ways ;	282.3998896388649
That he should even speak to her was amazing !	91.64446807658962
He was struggling for the appearance of composure , and would not open his lips , till he believed himself to have attained it .	10.148992648773882
She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight , and was certain of a willing listener in Jane , whenever she might wish to talk again of either .	4.8311557047160445
The tumult of her mind was now painfully great .	91.33489401897373
Oh , yes !	1630.3553256278274
and the respect which he felt for her high rank , and his veneration for her as his patroness , mingling with a very good opinion of himself , of his authority as a clergyman , and his rights as a rector , made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness , self-importance and humility .	3.0149170397356975
But , perhaps his sister does as well for the present , and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her .	6.897840912970475
but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to .	53.747652561614665
The first week of their return was soon gone .	91.71642122380304
It mortifies me .	1852.399695649452
Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood ;	21.74494048287311
I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more about it , and to ask when Denny comes back from town .	12.288120969453898
but if that be the case , there can at least be no want of subject .	22.48997276829591
It must have been his sister's doing .	183.49630799981077
and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning .	17.732966319489634
Collins's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter , to whom they could give little fortune ;	14.650302172488985
but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish .	7.0658696494665145
and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship's carriage was ready to take them all home .	11.7000343714931
The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent , had made a great difference in the country , and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees .	6.0514213475231875
But you are not entitled to know mine ;	126.41406564273024
cried Elizabeth .	3961.228037884354
Jane looked at her doubtingly .	475.2593905153287
E9 .	13586.708929614973
The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished ;	68.88060192205867
Had she found Jane in any apparent danger , Bennet would have been very miserable ;	26.10021518009865
These are home questions and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature .	17.376140410206837
And if not able to please himself in the arrangement , he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice .	11.79947830426032
In the first place , replied Gardiner , there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland .	14.506777212903701
In Three Volumes .	1640.0232948883847
More thoughtfulness , and less anxiety to please than when they last met , were plainly expressed .	18.995413237366122
His former acquaintance had been numerous ;	282.44437404839834
There was no one therefore who could be pointed out , as likely to give any news of him .	15.024472206293428
' Allow me , by the way , to observe , my fair cousin , that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer .	4.675873536544392
It has been most unconsciously done , however , and I hope will be of short duration .	21.934677830233845
and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood .	183.6576922541203
Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings , and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them .	18.9970648698514
Other books were produced , and after some deliberation he chose Fordyce's Sermons .	35.3051414270065
He found her as handsome as she had been last year ;	55.93546320516127
and it was certain , that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one , whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his weakest side .	5.550045769938238
Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory .	72.1617286731614
But here he was set right by Bennet , who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook , and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen .	4.809274986122819
Her character will be fixed , and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous .	8.481987401801229
Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole Park , but feared it might be beyond a walk .	15.016665775657204
and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins , the excellence of its cookery was owing .	15.020641251281729
She was now in an irritation as violent from delight , as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation .	12.28451765982937
She was immediately told , that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence ;	19.00254165240284
Bingley and Jane , however , soon allowed the others to outstrip them .	37.99672435981997

If you mean Darcy , cried her brother , he may go to bed , if he chuses , before it begins but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing ;	5.438230043353401
No , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems likely to rain ;	20.210709519535342
but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given , to remind her of her post .	7.076550542817062
They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching ;	4.813083661716044
but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went , for neither Lydia nor Collins were once silent .	9.57682481561483
no .	14491.435035225024
yes I understand you perfectly .	473.296294121307
On applying to see the place , they were admitted into the hall ;	37.42750036045956
You know how I detest it , unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner .	25.18499819425066
he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it .	9.309202265075063
It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side ;	35.40305860281147
it came from Netherfield , and the servant waited for an answer .	43.06094703847179
Four weeks passed away , and Jane saw nothing of him .	53.937595408950294
but in vain .	1868.1599207827956
Darcy replied with great intrepidity , Miss Elizabeth Bennet .	91.36058509390475
The gentleman experienced some change of feeling ;	182.92503594593404
I was obliged to confess one thing , which for a time , and not unjustly , offended him .	15.018687963302565
After many pauses and many trials of other subjects , Elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first , and saying , I am astonished at his intimacy with Bingley !	6.345165075409767
Darcy took up a book ;	471.80452139323853
When she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ;	23.62162801992681
I felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in marriage , because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right .	6.92248875633027
To this speech Bingley made no answer ;	185.17361517915145
A young man , such as you describe Bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks , and when accident separates them , so easily forgets her , that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent .	4.040051888538843
I hope at least he has not deceived us .	91.48455850396635
and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit .	12.304910709099731
but that it was no worse , she had need to be thankful .	35.42396526811176
but no one was less likely than Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life .	12.281188502885302
You are very ill .	874.0586526558463
Lady Catherine's great attentions to Collins you have been a daily witness of ;	35.324170837534034
Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter , and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again .	9.807890133956477
Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Bennet and the children .	35.3051414270065
Elizabeth was again deep in thought , and after a time exclaimed , To treat in such a manner , the god-son , the friend , the favourite of his father !	6.743814814941949
and she dwelt with energy on his many merits , as they proceeded together up the great staircase .	16.807854404014712
About a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in London ;	15.046762596124418
They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse ;	35.31135925486911
It was reasonable , however , to hope , that they would not continue long .	27.76888952171482
I am exceedingly gratified , said Bingley , by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper .	9.781102548496715
Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed ?	68.87435935390347
So , he enquired who she was , and got introduced , and asked her for the two next .	15.036694982759816
The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed , except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention .	10.580417150144608
Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory ;	91.40060461645092
Not that I shall though , she added to herself , as she finished the letter ;	22.550206922106337
a sense of very great ill usage , and most painful regrets at his being what he is .	16.83071913337731
My motive for cautioning you , is as follows .	91.34839961648215
He acknowledged the truth of it all ;	199.05937674764576
But little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there .	21.716651236722495
one I will not mention ;	474.85357993752467
A scheme of which every part promises delight , can never be successful ;	35.318018276957545
See <FILENAME> or <FILENAME> : ( <URL> ) or ( <URL> ) Images of the original pages are available through Internet Archive .	11.228419059099583
She did not fear her father's opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means , that she , his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her , was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till Darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile .	2.229992566373507
and after laughing at her some time , allowed her at last to go saying , as she quitted the room , If any young men come for Mary or Kitty , send them in , for I am quite at leisure .	4.257925326152588
and fearful , on the contrary , as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long , she urged Jane to borrow Bingley's carriage immediately , and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned , and the request made .	3.7976241514677502
She looked at Jane , and smiled , and shook her head by turns .	30.799548584797535
Yes , and her petticoat ;	472.33838790183415
I would go and see her , if I could have the carriage .	36.68775585754364
How was that possible ?	873.2577452231428
It was over at last however .	282.4684183941844
avoiding Bennet as much as possible , saying not much to Elizabeth , and nothing at all to the others .	15.282605407326958
here comes Hill .	1852.072171128788
This was invitation enough .	876.1734784710702
' She did indeed .	879.4591833077116
Lady Catherine listened to half a song , and then talked , as before , to her other nephew ;	15.022816785220126
But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought , and think only of what will make me happy , your affection , and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt .	5.894875023730946
Their powers of conversation were considerable .	282.6147487674214
Miss Bingley , said he , has given me credit for more than can be .	29.857317945383496
We know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode .	29.552070406116016
At such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth , though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband .	3.8141981591625926
To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love ;	35.43498359316526
for who would object to such a partner ?	126.12384740385846
He placed himself by her .	471.6336941039698
You know my mother's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends .	25.18499819425067
Excuse my interference .	1852.072171128788
That she should receive an offer of marriage from Darcy !	73.79920014129898
But Elizabeth had now recollected herself , and making a strong effort for it , was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished her all imaginable happiness .	4.437644490782079
The hall , the dining-room , and all its furniture were examined and praised ;	29.544561385042407
I will sit in my library , in my night cap and powdering gown , and give as much trouble as I can , or , perhaps , I may defer it , till Kitty runs away .	4.831738215415624
But it ended in nothing , and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again .	21.452171215247876
Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over , and , though determined not to slacken as a correspondent , it was for the sake of what had been , rather than what was .	4.483099911893832
There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same , but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh , I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters .	7.073280773654408
She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest , but Jane with all possible mildness declined interfering ;	18.996448885965236
She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte's observation , and hurried her away to her room .	5.942009049756724
But you forget , mama , said Elizabeth , that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that Long has promised to introduce him .	9.138077564238603
Wickham indeed had gone to her , on their first arrival in London , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her .	5.359263452067692
Have you never happened to see her there ?	126.92006177539189
Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane , while she was ill at Netherfield ?	20.175544635143865
Oh !	8965.45062507954
Conjectures as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her brain ;	22.41054019174471
She answered with equal indifference and brevity , and the other said no more .	31.3322177397668
I dislike it very much , he replied ;	126.08274271012002
For herself she was humbled ;	472.357018861332
It certainly is a most iniquitous affair , said Bennet , and nothing can clear Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn .	12.30628554527724
Why any fear of detection ?	472.357018861332
Bennet all amazement , though flattered by having a guest of such high importance , received her with the utmost politeness .	12.283454558794867
cried he , with an air of awkward gallantry ;	98.85067899196481
cried Lydia .	4356.758471927727
About a month ago I received this letter , and about a fortnight ago I answered it , for I thought it a case of some delicacy , and requiring early attention .	6.061155693429408
They were within twenty yards of each other , and so abrupt was his appearance , that it was impossible to avoid his sight .	11.394008602723193
When this information was given , and they had all taken their seats , Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire , and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment , that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings ;	3.121409713346223
To Catherine and Lydia , neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting .	22.834894417400733
He listened to her with perfect indifference , while she chose to entertain herself in this manner , and as his composure convinced her that all was safe , her wit flowed long .	5.882082398826756
It is something to think of , and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions .	19.582400372833714
This son was to join in cutting off the entail , as soon as he should be of age , and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for .	6.239238141962941
there is nothing marked in its lines .	184.4966276574387
and in her air altogether , there is a self-sufficiency without fashion , which is intolerable .	21.733376966095957
I do not pretend to regret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire , except your society , my dearest friend ;	12.801357708783707
Her astonishment , as she reflected on what had passed , was increased by every review of it .	18.863643501339926
she times them ill .	873.575015882092
Darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as Gracechurch Street , but he would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities , were he once to enter it ;	5.305093003699357
CHAPTER XVII .	4138.577761074046
Not yet , replied Jane .	472.0601324378849
but I do not know when that will be .	113.87229682722416
The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucas's last week ;	25.145183341833867
She expressed her gratitude again , but it was too painful a subject to each , to be dwelt on farther .	13.035486666029456
Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical .	126.11830890827804
Here , leading the way through every walk and cross walk , and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for , every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind .	4.507351480603189
Elizabeth could hardly help smiling , as she assured her that had not been the case .	21.74080954682199
though , when the letters were read , Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen .	10.735042584956506
and you , yourself , when last at Longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man , who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him .	7.371910459602674
and Collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment ;	9.933779684780426
Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount , and Elizabeth silently consented .	19.581413879880827
And what sort of young lady is she ?	126.37088414287213
She was engaged one day as she walked , in re-perusing Jane's last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by Darcy , she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her .	3.3211842050285205
It would have spared her , she thought , one sleepless night out of two .	26.029659170774778
who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself .	4.890591151757746
to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think , than such as did not .	13.545251789894674
But your arts and allurements may , in a moment of infatuation , have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family .	7.949088989711325
This unfortunate affair will , I fear , prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day .	14.111404764478845
It convinced her , that accident only could discover to Bingley her sister's being in town .	22.41216138719913
He had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research ;	10.339042328735793
E9 .	13586.708929614973
I am afraid , Darcy , observed Miss Bingley , in a half whisper , that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes .	8.133876491168653
On this point she was soon satisfied ;	183.05317268462866
He began to wish to know more of her , and as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others .	8.666944849195609
The compliment to herself and her sister , was not unfelt .	58.26246810243297
You must not blame my aunt .	284.61389969398977
has she any family ?	872.7545377705296
She was very wrong in singling me out as she did ;	53.722596742327866
Yet , indeed , I am in earnest .	139.60294532805113
I am sure you must feel it so .	134.8424748676923
You are charmingly group'd , and appear to uncommon advantage .	68.93866360949353
Let us hope for better things .	282.7151032780211
Charlotte's first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness ;	55.92991835555153
give a loose to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you cannot greatly err .	5.941812974758335
it was melancholy to leave her to such society !	91.51710377887684
Bennet , accompanied by her two youngest girls , reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast .	21.753975436692482
always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body !	35.3051414270065
And in the wretched state of his own finances , there was a very powerful motive for secrecy , in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia's relations , for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him , to a very considerable amount .	3.6561623673315675
Her heart was divided between concern for her sister , and resentment against all the others .	23.562931838784458
I am sure I know none so handsome ;	138.87958565933846
Were the whole arrangement complete , my disappointment would be certain .	53.93759540895025
its object was nothing less , than to secure her from any return of Collins's addresses , by engaging them towards herself .	11.228419059099583
Catherine was disconcerted , and made no answer ;	133.20279826019544
Elizabeth was surprised , however , that Wickham should consent to such a scheme , and , had she consulted only her own inclination , any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes .	4.9644567046806225
But she is too much like her brother , very , very proud .	35.38251734703239
His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party ;	29.550154583920055
Not yet , however , in spite of her disappointment in her husband , did Bennet give up the point .	15.949329318291433
Colonel Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity , proved that he was generally different , which her own knowledge of him could not have told her ;	8.305651796511478
CHAPTER XVI .	4353.740372381362
We are not on friendly terms , and it always gives me pain to meet him , but I have no reason for avoiding him but what I might proclaim to all the world ;	5.939550770850971
I have not seen her for many years , but I very well remember that I never liked her , and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent .	8.123646135006165
I am perfectly serious in my refusal .	183.8412956233378
You may well be surprised , Miss Bennet , at such an assertion , after seeing , as you probably might , the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday .	7.016440692532328
But it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations , and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for her , for a woman who had already refused him , as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham .	3.0737643159827854
no wonder if they love her better .	183.55008779214998
He could be still amiable , still pleasing , to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town ;	15.653721840503245
It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long expectations .	17.322850510440205
I perfectly comprehend your feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been .	15.009532399726695
The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits , in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share .	7.328022468965284
From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach , and with many speeches of thankfulness on Collins's side , and as many bows on Sir William's , they departed .	5.84153618212087
The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world , though only a few weeks before , when Lydia had first run away , they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune .	4.823665586165881
The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse , or covering a skreen .	10.330526262708958
Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia ;	474.3358253523056
As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night ;	6.425539670442542
Elizabeth , however , had never been blind to the impropriety of her father's behaviour as a husband .	18.875475105293635
The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic .	35.307836105462044
Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton .	69.23179890486018
and in their brother's manners there was something better than politeness ;	53.752655299069204
Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight .	91.4702385855301
Yes the late Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift .	21.72259364513727
Lady Lucas herself has often said so , and envied me Jane's beauty .	35.466736243213305
We will go round the Park every day .	126.7008588108492
What would she have said ?	471.7967405676444
Of Collins and Lizzy .	874.9755225198612
and his civilities were worn out like his information .	91.57567436485968
Three daughters married !	1852.072171128788
but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just ;	15.732361183697211
One does not know what to think .	203.9173010831948
She resolved to give her the information herself , and therefore charged Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner , to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family .	5.7499848283755615
I have heard much of your master's fine person , said Gardiner , looking at the picture ;	20.609548733879134
They may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more exceptionable purpose .	18.99817679546532
Elizabeth could not refuse , though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit .	35.42809685480058
But every body is to judge for themselves , and the Lucases are very good sort of girls , I assure you .	11.80117031120801
And as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses , to buy them , after they are married .	5.304710315637185
I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular , but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish .	7.334886173838894
She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her , must be the work of her brother , and without looking farther , it was satisfactory ;	5.942009049756724
advised her to return to bed , and promised her some draughts .	43.035708093730584
His regiment is there ;	873.2116359335714
END OF THE SECOND VOLUME .	471.56144177488704
Stay , stay , I will go myself .	126.07739456675078
did not I mention it to you ?	182.9046321206164
Elizabeth privately added , And how much I shall have to conceal .	44.73022578923624
And with these words he hastily left the room , and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house .	9.438144687184813
This match , to which you have the presumption to aspire , can never take place .	22.41707132136381
Exceedingly well .	4743.677376410631
But he paid her not the smallest attention , till her grandfather's death made her mistress of this fortune .	15.037417509071503
and yet there have been things enough happened in the time .	53.89492965329741
Without allowing herself time for consideration , and scarcely knowing what she felt , Elizabeth on finishing this letter , instantly seized the other , and opening it with the utmost impatience , read as follows : it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first .	3.4824060477287277
The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire , lest she should suffer from the change of room ;	12.309726080803198
I am glad it occurred to me to mention it ;	69.16079806006371
but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us , for she went up stairs half an hour ago .	12.606376557824873
CHAPTER XIII .	4138.577761074046
An easy distance do you call it ?	183.55008779214998
Lizzy , cried her mother , remember where you are , and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home .	7.665678078397106
and , to imitate his politeness , she began , as they met , to admire the beauty of the place ;	12.604707399246298
Then taking the disengaged arm of Darcy , she left Elizabeth to walk by herself .	26.531512449507787
But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general .	21.787058822334462
Nothing child , nothing .	874.8220436768123
It was possible , however , that some of his companions in the shire , might be able to give more information ;	12.096754991057551
Well , cried Elizabeth , have it as you choose .	73.87705132855761
but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him , her anger was turned against herself ;	15.034235494024939
Had it been your uncle's doing , I must and would have paid him ;	29.56398723865295
She assured him that no one intended to play , and the silence of the whole party on the subject , seemed to justify her .	9.936779854020164
She was shewn into the breakfast-parlour , where all but Jane were assembled , and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise .	10.245314575208443
and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away .	12.635962230583205
The observations of her uncle and aunt now began ;	107.16745276026306
Elizabeth made no answer ;	890.7045050106072
I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home , and see if I can make it up any better .	11.104258992780977
He must be an oddity , I think , said she .	56.18783282081747
How can you talk so ?	505.3600550934358
Has she been presented ?	878.2287942620416
There were some very strong objections against the lady , were Colonel Fitzwilliam's words , and these strong objections probably were , her having one uncle who was a country attorney , and another who was in business in London .	4.425107782585959
I shall see her again !	472.2713802486462
But her mind was so busily engaged , that she did not always know when she was silent .	17.802429927079363
though often standing within a very short distance of her , quite disengaged , he never came near enough to speak .	12.288205028183615
Yes , there was something in that ;	183.15959188304265
After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ;	7.481026164900391
Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention .	182.98440716939632
It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match .	15.455198356686576
Beyond a doubt , they do wish him to chuse Miss Darcy , replied Jane ;	25.14344703474128
But of course she did not mention my name to you .	53.9414068469149
But as no such delicacy restrained her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back , she should think herself very ill used .	3.4824807488104916
Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts ;	36.62566092350164
If he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to Long .	36.821672934401306
' Those were your words .	474.85357993752467
It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life .	15.010131339046668
Her nose wants character ;	873.1510774730008
but depend upon it I will carry my point .	91.334049870353
Gratitude , not merely for having once loved her , but for loving her still well enough , to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him , and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection .	4.5135615901992905
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again , having still a great deal to say to her , and many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends .	6.549209281834215
Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves .	183.26256978913838
and in your heart , you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you .	25.16517398555611
Oh !	8965.45062507954
Yes , and I had heard it before .	132.64812611426748
As he said this , she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer .	18.168127219508232
Her colour changed , and she said no more .	95.67421977229331
Such formidable accounts of her Ladyship , and her manner of living , quite frightened Maria Lucas , who had been little used to company , and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings , with as much apprehension , as her father had done to his presentation at James's .	3.606574944222396
When they had gained their own room , Jane taking out the letter , said , This is from Caroline Bingley ;	12.311987824323335
Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest , and then , sick of this folly , took refuge in her own room , that she might think with freedom .	7.5187324761863055
The rector of a parish has much to do .	91.33489401897373
You forced me into visiting him last year , and promised if I went to see him , he should marry one of my daughters .	9.086850311891881
She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors , she wanted to compose her own , and to make herself agreeable to all ;	8.299382951239055
Pardon me for interrupting you , Madam , cried Collins ;	75.10802145779748
;	79705.2373252203
Society has claims on us all ;	282.32115989634974
They were rather handsome , had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town , had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds , were in the habit of spending more than they ought , and of associating with people of rank ;	4.200525850794406
and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn .	56.064778473383875
After this day , Jane said no more of her indifference .	53.729735245686705
and now we are better .	474.87721155101036
Your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you .	35.32361903768041
There is some sense in what he says about the girls however ;	43.086203148080585
and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself .	30.585067583537043
Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me .	55.94857178586928
Lady Catherine herself says that in point of true beauty , Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex ;	10.338102572447522
thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together ;	53.69533281330631
Had I but explained some part of it only some part of what I learnt , to my own family !	13.897421683530297
Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue ;	44.97927869564127
I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love !	35.39144527357668
when we met at Pemberley .	473.296294121307
My temper would perhaps be called resentful .	182.95624661430412
You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world .	11.715942751710626
I did not know that you intended to walk , said Miss Bingley , in some confusion , lest they had been overheard .	11.89866698819251
It was all over before I arrived ;	182.99269458266832
cried Elizabeth , as soon as they were by themselves .	86.40812341766605
Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in .	283.84337783569106
wished his fair cousins health and happiness again , and promised their father another letter of thanks .	18.995413237366122
This was spoken jestingly , but it appeared to her so just a picture of Darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer ;	9.176794543239659
Miss Bingley , however , was incapable of disappointing Darcy in any thing , and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives .	9.509475964009454
Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded ;	25.15810388684224
He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins , from a conviction that if they saw him depart , they could not fail to conjecture his design , and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise ;	3.8402142970733775
and she could not help remembering what Charlotte's opinion had always been .	49.062436126809196
CHAPTER XIV .	4138.577761074046
Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable .	53.726742415995965
In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended ;	56.04222408318019
Well , then , you need not be under any alarm .	53.768914659678266
I think she will be pleased with the hermitage .	91.52891726522503
Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error , and seek to clear one , without involving the other .	11.259149944453156
If they believed him attached to me , they would not try to part us ;	26.498899085523338
but he eluded the skill of them all ;	126.3366823180881
Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me .	68.87435935390347
And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen .	4.955090878376105
She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman ;	35.32771105338258
I am all astonishment .	873.0928609222244
The conversation soon turned upon fishing , and she heard Darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport .	2.94126841496401
Dearest Jane !	4743.677376410631
The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy ;	53.69991330566006
And accordingly she did turn , and they walked towards the Parsonage together .	36.62213077838682
and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September , than any body else in the country .	11.548275838094595
I will make no promise of the kind .	126.23352695724233
But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was .	21.716651236722495
Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine , what is to befall her ?	23.36364008052892
I have been a selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle .	19.045353409524758
My dearest child , she cried , I can think of nothing else !	39.55506457798384
and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia , her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost importance , and till he entered the room , the misery of her impatience was severe .	5.543274035959529
Some acquaintance or other , my dear , I suppose ;	83.11451885619977
Oh !	8965.45062507954
The venison was roasted to a turn and everybody said , they never saw so fat a haunch .	16.803430564954688
Your picture may be very exact , Louisa , said Bingley ;	53.726742415995965
That he has neither integrity nor honour .	183.64062220953969
On and Gardiner's coming up , they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment ;	15.87166817097451
nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion .	29.61014183949207
and you cannot imagine how well he looked !	126.44663527364816
How he lived I know not .	282.45680254758156
She has two nieces of her own .	183.56779344167384
But tell me , what did you come down to Netherfield for ?	43.03858020850592
and when I am in town it is pretty much the same .	43.07704273829535
Many small donations ( $1 to $5 , 000 ) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS .	12.304661234785812
Very well .	4366.227540289468
Oh !	8965.45062507954
It is of all subjects my delight .	183.00071728060837
I am sorry to hear that ;	290.5300718820124
and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of Lydia's leaving home .	26.940073941575182
A gentleman and a stranger !	502.54875420974787
He sat with them above an hour , and was in remarkably good spirits .	31.66544916954414
Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia ;	19.026933428703703
what is the matter ?	875.9138416182061
The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia , depended less on any single event , or any particular person , for though they each , like Elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with Wickham , he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them , and a ball was at any rate , a ball .	2.995081933623523
Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ;	68.98491021629417
and pray tell her from me , that she cannot expect to excel , if she does not practise a great deal .	11.510075559782926
I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things .	43.171586046240314
They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room ;	95.66658791421001
nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family .	9.571066311549071
Is my father in town ?	472.51125484192454
If I could but see you as happy !	126.34267780511186
You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling , I am sure you did .	30.497176982734363
It was not till the afternoon , when he joined them at tea , that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject ;	12.619740551913218
Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves , vanity to what we would have others think of us .	15.009175861060113
Heaven forbid !	4349.971333827082
Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule ;	183.9845261424681
And of your infliction , cried Elizabeth with energy .	95.66253934372803
From what he said of Miss Darcy , I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , reserved , disagreeable girl .	12.966981509933191
Their other aunt also visited them frequently , and always , as she said , with the design of cheering and heartening them up , though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of Wickham's extravagance or irregularity , she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them .	3.149132872907061
Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday ?	183.44484738882525
Without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ;	7.04392864625295
I depend on you for that .	282.33513186395595
I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it ;	44.876414373306645
In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike , she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man's affection , and though her intentions did not vary for an instant , she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive ;	4.272007538738086
I can remember no symptom of affection on either side ;	69.00549514227477
Your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions ;	21.725280545489284
If you should have no objection to receive me into your house , I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family , Monday , November 18th , by four o'clock , and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se'night following , which I can do without any inconvenience , as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday , provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day .	2.1886856589151895
She knew not how to support herself , and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour .	15.415075408552074
for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation .	8.49874068831134
Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Miss Bennet ;	23.161221236399978
She replied in the affirmative .	471.6152006322248
What is it you mean ?	474.4862416312743
You must feel it ;	874.5482085069312
Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play , she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer .	5.324065308888688
You must come and make Lizzy marry Collins , for she vows she will not have him , and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her .	6.051725923342183
replied her sister .	1852.072171128788
I might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little endeavour at civility , I am thus rejected .	11.228657208683504
I can easily believe it .	503.6238123914781
Jane , I take your place now , and you must go lower , because I am a married woman .	13.529112543694348
He took the hint , and soon began with , This seems a very comfortable house .	21.717129048379526
and from all Bingley's connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it , from that very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him , of their becoming hereafter her own .	5.785084131731905
Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have !	69.14404697851874
He did look at it and into it for half an hour , was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms , satisfied with what the owner said in its praise , and took it immediately .	5.019530090909688
It adds even another motive .	471.6296704665073
My good qualities are under your protection , and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible ;	17.804259780605665
Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable .	183.64995882402962
We can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough ;	53.7159705188591
too good for the waiter , is not it ?	95.64525075053155
but it had not been so in Derbyshire .	136.61299118076118
Elizabeth , to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this , heard it in silent indignation .	15.443238432699294
What sister would think herself at liberty to do it , unless there were something very objectionable ?	19.58125943470522
but no one looked more amused than Bennet himself , while his wife seriously commended Collins for having spoken so sensibly , and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas , that he was a remarkably clever , good kind of young man .	4.310272563695816
Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour , he had been able to get the better of himself .	14.489094547204928
The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident .	91.33489401897373
My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology .	68.89015060068674
You may depend upon it , Madam , said Miss Bingley , with cold civility , that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us .	7.864795275842368
They could have been understood only by her mother , who might have felt nearly the same .	19.57943636381756
I am sure I shall break mine , said Lydia .	74.95638110106994
His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary ;	25.149716973833225
What relates to yourself , is as follows .	126.12682109117601
dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter , which , in her ladyship's apprehension , peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance , in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew , which she had refused to give .	3.7366532521949463
and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations .	91.3733702366831
I do not know .	833.899800936731
To oblige you , I would try to believe almost any thing , but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this ;	8.482697228432533
There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them , for Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam , the younger son of his uncle , Lord and to the great surprise of all the party , when Collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him .	3.727298528987582
This is my advice .	875.5366098958821
There was also a postscript to this effect .	126.30693218010933
Though her manner varied however , her determination never did .	68.99262769125288
Good gracious !	4123.65795852664
It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day .	16.88017041606289
Yes , I have had a letter from him by express .	59.72728315212915
I am perfectly convinced by it that Darcy has no defect .	53.90548246905733
but when he went away , the whole family returned to their usual employments , and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration , for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden , or in reading and writing , and looking out of window in his own book room , which fronted the road .	2.4250746105002623
Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments .	283.06814670791914
Dear madam , cried Hill , in great astonishment , don't you know there is an express come for master from Gardiner ?	11.228419059099583
Gardiner added in his letter , that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day , which was Saturday .	10.012593747667912
and your wit and vivacity I think must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite .	7.7837097532676465
only three miles .	1852.072171128788
Kitty , who took all these threats in a serious light , began to cry .	25.17920120354273
Two of her girls had been on the point of marriage , and after all there was nothing in it .	14.610348246599756
I am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection .	13.155514019349228
I fancy she was wanted about the mince pies .	91.3296803691227
You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy .	5.27736771232745
for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him , I should only think worse of her understanding , than I now do of her heart .	7.479765266885756
A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music , singing , drawing , dancing , and the modern languages , to deserve the word ;	8.887343012086884
We acted with the best intentions .	282.47489418737564
and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room .	68.87671581652873
there was good humour and kindness .	283.1725539633298
Elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him ;	91.4824338473515
Let me hear from you very soon .	183.52733776072222
and Collins , being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader , was extremely well pleased to close his large book , and go .	7.3413166157915715
How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love ?	30.663177208855107
I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me .	43.10853538908485
my dear Bennet , as she entered the room , we have had a most delightful evening , a most excellent ball .	12.17264444007673
cried Bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , if that disagreeable Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley !	8.972686052831301
But we are none of us consistent ;	184.00152770602074
Bennet , who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him , continued her triumph .	21.753975436692482
condolence , insufferable .	1852.072171128788
With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content ;	100.24144690983042
Not at all .	1746.4529538439435
Let me congratulate you , on a very important conquest .	69.06481795283676
and you must feel , as well as I do , that the woman who marries him , cannot have a proper way of thinking .	9.815234571419355
but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply .	55.03601527704881
My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness , and I confess that I did not expect to receive more than my due .	9.206981510727411
though when the first tumult of joy was over , she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while .	10.014015756858655
Lizzy declares she will not have Collins , and Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy .	16.14363339128148
The journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane ;	68.88060192205867
All were struck with the stranger's air , all wondered who he could be , and Kitty and Lydia , determined if possible to find out , led the way across the street , under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop , and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot .	2.8374778287637574
Bingley was quite uncomfortable ;	876.7604997548386
He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper ;	126.09257234873176
There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law .	14.278870982157382
But Gardiner could not be seen , and Darcy found , on further enquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning .	6.56037957808128
The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news , and telling again what had been already written ;	15.056064498319609
No ;	13601.676459159366
I shall not go away , till you have given me the assurance I require .	25.255135147032707
but she checked herself .	874.2007039933796
Yet why did he come ?	473.296294121307
and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls .	53.7718520597076
On the contrary every particular relative to his sister , was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself ;	13.836739251753865
If it be not so , let Darcy contradict it .	69.16138360565506
I guessed as much .	872.8063687780879
But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person ;	31.33213517090796
This is a parade , cried he , which does one good ;	43.11186783082566
My dear , replied her husband , I have two small favours to request .	29.64452720580849
cried he , turning towards her .	284.4228385630913
The walk being here less sheltered than on the other side , allowed them to see him before they met .	13.890396770969398
That among his own connections he was esteemed and valued that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling .	4.174909304746405
Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing ;	47.578609222301694
Lord !	14396.939037894257
They returned therefore in good spirits to Longbourn , the village where they lived , and of which they were the principal inhabitants .	10.331201615247469
But my father cannot .	879.564834067522
if , indeed , such a report is in existence .	72.1617286731614
and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in his regimentals .	19.00322428988127
The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw .	53.69991330566006
As a child , she was affectionate and pleasing , and extremely fond of me ;	25.243919850156065
Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house , and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane .	9.0522728476043
Poor Reynolds , she was always very fond of me .	69.04846192585065
I have certainly meant well through the whole affair .	91.37187596038461
Calling back the servant , therefore , she commissioned him , though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible , to fetch his master and mistress home , instantly .	6.162581299926441
And this is always the way with him , she added .	58.4814966588296
I wish I could say , for the sake of her family , that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children , produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible , amiable , well-informed woman for the rest of her life ;	3.6433341546493367
But my feelings are not only cordial towards him ;	91.80054051891115
It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together , and yet for the advantage of some , conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible .	4.640125713162069
After walking two or three times along that part of the lane , she was tempted , by the pleasantness of the morning , to stop at the gates and look into the park .	6.137923863030215
Upon my honour , I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life , as I have this evening ;	13.498337016231138
Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the next day , and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Wickham , and give him an invitation also , if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening .	4.443873654679663
Unfeeling , selfish girl !	872.7545377705296
Darcy is engaged to my daughter .	282.45455988770306
I was told , that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married , but that you , that Miss Elizabeth Bennet , would , in all likelihood , be soon afterwards united to my nephew , my own nephew , Darcy .	3.7289574418125224
she cried .	4102.7129695329595
They owed the restoration of Lydia , her character , every thing to him .	29.54736204271408
and she could no more bear that Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first vehemence of her disapprobation .	9.782371574990972
and could she have included Jane in the scheme , every part of it would have been perfect .	18.63577703873166
You know not what you are about .	183.3931491472005
And upon Elizabeth's seeming really , with vexed and embarrassed looks , about to escape , she added , Lizzy , I insist upon your staying and hearing Collins .	7.809908186401838
sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man .	16.80241529948447
Your list of the common extent of accomplishments , said Darcy , has too much truth .	23.56871499495155
E7 .	15895.509420740158
how he must have felt it !	282.96773252025656
Not at all , he replied ;	286.22232240782847
But Jane knows , as well as I do , what Wickham really is .	34.53384166566611
To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire , when that conviction had been given , was scarcely the work of a moment .	11.801378697811785
La !	13586.708929614973
Of what he has particularly accused me I am ignorant ;	68.98385176489435
And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit ;	29.659697356911245
Its banks were neither formal , nor falsely adorned .	91.70755495547165
As for Elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia , that she considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter ;	4.429646126740538
It is unlucky , said she , after a short pause , that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country .	9.94810841473023
Not as you represent it .	472.0601324378849
I told you the other day , of his infamous behaviour to Darcy ;	37.531196937174364
And what is fifty miles of good road ?	126.37088414287213
till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk , she made some slight observation on the dance .	8.405772650651175
the compliment must be all for herself .	183.11924784020894
The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected .	68.88060192205867
I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out , if possible , from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment , whether Wickham has any relations or connections , who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself .	3.355160227592515
Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay , for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other .	7.954815762397504
You know not , you can scarcely conceive , how they have tortured me ;	29.593683191793335
A flirt too , in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation ;	43.052276705733114
and if I was her , I would not have put up with it .	31.355002031955262
They were confined for the evening at different tables , and she had nothing to hope , but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room , as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself .	4.628190479679209
PRIDE PREJUDICE .	4743.677376410631
I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters , and beg leave to apologise for it , as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends , but of this hereafter .	4.142526724008555
but though Jane would have defended either or both , had they appeared to be wrong , she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister .	7.949115546500058
and affectionately taking her hand , said in reply , Do not make yourself uneasy , my love .	18.32358174747418
For heaven's sake , madam , speak lower .	126.2444910835673
when her father continued , You look conscious .	126.44169118455625
When I last saw her , she was not very promising .	59.90613438272834
They are wanted in the farm , Bennet , are not they ?	43.11512686097023
Elizabeth listened , wondered , doubted , and was impatient for more .	44.73022578923624
The part which I acted , is now to be explained .	53.69991330566006
Elizabeth longed to observe that Bingley had been a most delightful friend ;	43.04048948406033
How merry we shall be together when we meet !	91.3611654082918
When this was done , she had a less active part to play .	36.62926206047642
Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression .	473.1130194100226
She could think only of her letter .	184.3623594117846
but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger .	16.822564014326474
His own father did not long survive mine , and within half a year from these events , Wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally resolved against taking orders , he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be benefited .	2.6953300827895688
I do not remember her name among the ladies at court .	53.7671671782708
and as Dawson does not object to the Barouche box , there will be very good room for one of you and indeed , if the weather should happen to be cool , I should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you large .	3.741129471091969
but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ;	26.007701794992876
That would be a good scheme , said Elizabeth , if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home .	11.753598338537456
though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Bingley in consequence of it , before they did .	11.265880426109266
This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared ;	43.12928708920078
Not that I am afraid of myself , but I dread other people's remarks .	30.793963061104186
for give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained .	5.055987451808383
And so , is it quite certain he is coming ?	69.33057798598722
London : Printed for T Egerton , Military Library , Whitehall .	53.69533281330631
Things are settled so oddly .	471.56144177488665
If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity .	4.796380213693545
It was greatly my wish that he should do so , he added , as soon as his marriage was fixed on .	13.248032690327173
You cannot be too much on your guard .	133.22171580570122
I have said no such thing .	282.4981947602293
and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf , is natural and amiable .	9.928240562428174
But it is not merely this affair , she continued , on which my dislike is founded .	20.61254190742712
She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind ;	35.3074715473908
and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment .	53.71987331803018
But I make no doubt , they often talk of it between themselves .	36.635959172773305
and before she could strike into another path , she was overtaken by Wickham .	29.543227901560055
and sometimes did venture a short sentence , when there was least danger of its being heard .	18.995865344765782
I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ?	49.089280097677424
and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement , without the intention of marriage , she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey .	4.4181499248826075
As that was the case , neither Jane , to whom I related the whole , nor I , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public ;	8.572333037628205
After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject , Bennet coolly observed , From all that I can collect by your manner of talking , you must be two of the silliest girls in the country .	5.016286030490665
They are in the same profession , you know ;	91.52834339031001
And I have another favour to ask .	184.02289964922286
She had not been many hours at home , before she found that the Brighton scheme , of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn , was under frequent discussion between her parents .	5.099238732863153
Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton , where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the King , during his mayoralty .	5.3124552625079415
Anxiety on Jane's behalf , was another prevailing concern , and Darcy's explanation , by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion , heightened the sense of what Jane had lost .	5.941812974758335
But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends , will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ?	3.827659736220902
The other is Miss De Bourgh .	282.3552787512534
how rich and how great you will be !	126.32484791257149
And have you heard from him often ?	182.94278039473133
In the absence of Jane , he always attached himself to Elizabeth , for the pleasure of talking of her ;	14.282301628286517
What am I to do ?	502.4829145683866
Engraved for No .	1852.072171128788
Elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint , being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply .	9.557104199122916
That they might have met without ill consequence , is perhaps probable ;	43.05103763533553
But I can guess how it was ;	183.04375019823956
But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else .	10.583494664772255
but neither that , nor any thing else , awakened a suspicion of the truth .	25.988828376929284
I hope there was .	875.027485426909
1 .	10898.860396037358
But , if I were you , I would stand by the nephew .	38.007805021655976
Darcy walked off ;	1853.239096846129
The officer was the very Denny , concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire , and he bowed as they passed .	10.330526262708958
But here , she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character , for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness , and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet .	4.039579694533041
Had Lydia's marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms , it was not to be supposed that Darcy would connect himself with a family , where to every other objection would now be added , an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned .	3.4888608236541025
No , no , let me shift for myself ;	91.94813471834938
I am impatient to see him .	282.4123584095834
The carriage was sent to meet them at , and they were to return in it , by dinner-time .	15.010046494723772
For forty years , he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support .	15.020312354785188
but Elizabeth heard not a word , and , wholly engrossed by her own feelings , followed them in silence .	14.669471972206729
hang Kitty !	4743.677376410631
And my mother How is she ?	282.38495090954865
From his garden , Collins would have led them round his two meadows , but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost , turned back ;	6.238293414884692
She is happy , then , said her father , drily ;	60.734455229790996
I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing !	55.98205219201826
I wonder when you would have spoken , if I had not asked you !	31.283075730726306
Jane looked well , and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits , amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them .	7.65197361202109
She is almost three and twenty !	282.667329923674
I must ask whether you were surprised ?	183.2709417074034
She listened most attentively to all that passed between them , and gloried in every expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , his taste , or his good manners .	5.215597186733792
But we are all liable to error .	184.00152770602074
Elizabeth could not but look surprised .	283.879514333237
Bingley , from this time , was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn ;	29.556693694063988
Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him .	91.70755495547165
Younger sons cannot marry where they like .	182.9046321206164
I believe him to be Lady Catherine's nephew .	126.64712367176486
This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence , and the little value he put on his own good qualities .	11.512485996398624
and after stating her imprudence , I am happy to add , that I owed the knowledge of it to herself .	12.615461337766035
In future , I hope we shall be always of one mind .	44.73584380821252
I hope , my dear , said Bennet to his wife , as they were at breakfast the next morning , that you have ordered a good dinner to-day , because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party .	4.962790586106471
his friend had given him the earliest information of it .	69.03007866997895
But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration , and gave most gracious smiles , especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them .	7.3279688271760595
Mary , said she , I wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun !	21.03846390743806
Steady to his purpose , he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday , and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour , he adhered most conscientiously to his book , and would not even look at her .	3.7321900295779424
let us hear all the particulars , not forgetting their comparative height and size ;	29.54241929447434
My child , let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life .	15.01137816749096
I am sure I sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night .	46.39770964507346
Elizabeth's collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ;	72.08630135396086
but it pleased her .	874.9367833353373
It became her turn to listen .	282.3586037903365
Lady Catherine was generally speaking stating the mistakes of the three others , or relating some anecdote of herself .	15.06887394014532
At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress , and at half past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner .	13.8952609453757
and instantly embracing her , acknowledged , with the liveliest emotion , that she was the happiest creature in the world .	13.060693701198364
He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man , upon my word ;	25.989290972810718
Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year ?	49.578354590903274
but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood , I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger .	15.460245036678907
And who knows what may happen ?	282.38495090954865
They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter , will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others , for who , as lady Catherine herself condescendingly says , will connect themselves with such a family .	4.0993606753313
You have withheld the advantages , which you must know to have been designed for him .	23.891581928132116
If he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , I shall soon cease to regret him at all .	7.485106309673162
but I think I may defy even your sagacity , to discover the name of your admirer .	19.58832405177827
He now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before ;	4.194122699609656
and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted , which , in her anxious interpretation , denoted a recollection of Jane , not untinctured by tenderness , and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her , had he dared .	3.7810205294065424
Collins's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete .	91.32606463305149
I do not know what to say to you .	108.17940285308153

After tea , Bennet retired to the library , as was his custom , and Mary went up stairs to her instrument .	11.975085223761496
You must give me leave to judge for myself , and pay me the compliment of believing what I say .	14.50054029284063

Our poor mother is sadly grieved .	283.5676853574684
Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through Longbourn-house .	68.98385176489435
and as it had been asked without the least suspicion , she was not distressed by his repeating it .	16.133078703460857
and I could wish , Miss Bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either .	5.9305300362039945
Whenever Charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ;	21.71546549754084
But , my dear , you must indeed go and see Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood .	18.614793968569803
Elizabeth was distressed .	1854.592280176145
or me either , for that matter .	183.2912645300379
Haggerston has our directions , and all will be completed in a week .	35.3051414270065
and as she was no horse-woman , walking was her only alternative .	43.217843289262056
Her coming there was the most unfortunate , the most ill-judged thing in the world !	26.499569516991755
and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with , though she could not be in such raptures as Collins expected the scene to inspire , and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house , and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis De Bourgh .	3.252906811650888
The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady , to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable ;	8.885772532969018
Darcy drew his chair a little towards her , and said , You cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment .	11.414867701211813
His being such a charming young man , and so rich , and living but three miles from them , were the first points of self-gratulation ;	8.482171234483218
Let me do it without farther loss of time .	91.5954701443466
sensible that if such an idea had been suggested , his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it .	8.885356881459405
My dear aunt , how could you think of it ?	68.94387333691613
Lady Catherine , I believe , did a great deal to it when Collins first came to Hunsford .	18.65299453931176
I began to be afraid you would never come back again .	53.69720858441741
What could become of Bingley and Jane !	183.8640882951814
I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me , but if the same circumstances were to happen again , I am sure I should be deceived again .	6.080588044133804
said her mother .	1854.9554321945773
good or bad ?	1852.072171128788
They were in street .	874.3785723694476
It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat , and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour .	5.32073838128629
Darcy had been at her sister's wedding .	182.98440716939632
Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme ;	68.88296806941361
her husband looked impenetrably grave ;	473.83324968387916
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind , as was here collected in one individual .	6.93143469514044
Such as vanity and pride .	472.6522511706156
Miss Lydia is going to be married ;	193.03108780427917
for Bennet , having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase , than she entered the breakfast-room , and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection .	2.9441272510407916
Thank Heaven !	4378.812588156309
We have certainly done our best ;	283.4273592077425
Wickham began the subject himself .	472.27931004825064
Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day , and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation , c .	10.852935766835333
and for the first evening she was his settled choice .	68.87671581652873
Elizabeth was excessively disappointed ;	873.8232641244884
If your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless , you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ;	9.557745014622736
The easy assurance of the young couple , indeed , was enough to provoke him .	25.988999948091063
She followed him thither ;	872.8639835499257
He meant to resign his commission immediately ;	182.92834490122445
Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared , Darcy was continually giving offence .	25.19833776958841
that he is to take possession before Michaelmas , and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week .	8.69157142842084
Nor did he seem much more at ease ;	126.55438690341512
Why was he to be the judge ?	183.16570495715496
But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge ?	25.988691938195394
Hurst and Bingley were at piquet , and Hurst was observing their game .	35.49690685980082
I must beg , therefore , to be importuned no farther on the subject .	31.7878995635192
As the weather was fine , they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park .	15.43559860993892
Then shewing her purchases : Look here , I have bought this bonnet .	35.36063440189834
and so did Forster .	876.808496125611
I never saw a more promising inclination .	183.24621241655092
Every girl in , or near Meryton , was out of her senses about him for the first two months ;	13.53387250409708
and pray what is the result ?	282.3340390589578
Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter , and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Bingley himself , instead of a ceremonious card .	6.3539752242130785
My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents .	7.949683207455131
Perhaps that is not possible for any one .	126.2444910835673
It was a painful , but not an improbable , conjecture .	53.818482292896775
My mother was taken ill immediately , and the whole house in such confusion !	30.685625850702387
To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered , but the state of indecision in which she remained , as to the extent of what she should communicate ;	2.49687360803857
And you are never to stir out of doors , till you can prove , that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner .	7.856214945013704
He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from that , I am inclined to hope , he might have been misunderstood before .	8.890646764132784
and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop , or Lady Catherine de Bourgh , by venturing to dance .	4.981700422198645
Do you think it incredible that Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ?	7.487068654074989
but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side , I hope it will not be long before they are .	7.448254466983734
Elizabeth was pleased to find , that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend , for , though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world , she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him .	4.504211342799336
But who could have foreseen such an attention as this ?	68.87953047542963
and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin's affairs , and whose character she had no reason to question .	4.1014972073671805
Compliments always take you by surprise , and me never .	71.92368775476572
or under what misrepresentation , can you here impose upon others ?	53.78210820802474
My feelings in every respect forbid it .	182.95624661430412
The families who had been in town for the winter came back again , and summer finery and summer engagements arose .	12.600619181221507
I could not bear to have her ten miles from me ;	56.184225602482144
Such were the gentle murmurs of Bennet , and they gave way only to the greater distress of Bingley's continued absence .	12.6118086130242
Jane was so admired , nothing could be like it .	69.07063108690045
their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ;	35.3051414270065
You ought all to have learned .	282.36793845088044
yes , said Elizabeth drily Darcy is uncommonly kind to Bingley , and takes a prodigious deal of care of him .	12.618807099751079
If it be so , if I have been misled by such error , to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable .	8.316332340981514
I am a gentleman's daughter ;	471.7276213149332
But I confess they would have no charms for me .	68.91692006206831
That is my idea of good breeding ;	183.20956974969667
but , to be sure , it would have been such a thing for me !	30.1740834193794
But I am willing to hope the best , and that his character has been misunderstood .	24.39227451155027
But their father , though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure , was really glad to see them ;	15.009897065053995
To be sure , Lizzy , said her aunt , he is not so handsome as Wickham ;	20.408511751069717
Wickham so very bad !	874.2161235676816
She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire , and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister , in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter .	5.394962526733552
Every thing was too recent for gaiety , but the evening passed tranquilly away ;	29.683184497577198
and yet , it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham .	12.30503790381826
Most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote .	26.082080575994503
He was on one side of her mother .	136.49553300119467
He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given me .	9.564544738184619
Collins must excuse me .	873.575015882092
I wish you very happy and very rich , and by refusing your hand , do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise .	9.57986340878892
but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing .	53.94175666815104
Bennet made no answer .	877.3124117520488
The hill , crowned with wood , from which they had descended , receiving increased abruptness from the distance , was a beautiful object .	9.556929110282953
She was humbled , she was grieved ;	183.0260873160541
He who , she had been persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest enemy , seemed , on this accidental meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance , and without any indelicate display of regard , or any peculiarity of manner , where their two selves only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister .	2.521193534347312
Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received , in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense .	13.53721699108951
By the Author of Sense and Sensibility .	168.36914182367553
These are heavy misfortunes , replied Elizabeth .	184.49662765743855
and I assure you , I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement .	16.04283218165185
I felt nothing but surprise .	471.5869008114699
Did he know of their intending to go off ?	91.50792920719019
Give my love to Colonel Forster , I hope you will drink to our good journey .	25.21075802253522
Lady Catherine has been of infinite use , which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use .	11.519189902070611
Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers' names and connections .	35.33961345722203
That she should have walked three miles so early in the day , in such dirty weather , and by herself , was almost incredible to Hurst and Miss Bingley ;	6.92574914843239
she continued to declare that she would , and the argument ended only with the visit .	21.724742550523004
for else they will be destitute enough .	182.97720770802562
We were married , you know , at Clement's , because Wickham's lodgings were in that parish .	20.445942252046997
A great deal more passed at the other table .	96.1788829957275
They descended the hill , crossed the bridge , and drove to the door ;	30.589347514864002
But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her , so soon after this event .	21.768899764348998
The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte's situation , and his expectation of a young olive-branch .	13.524978223492045
I never thought Darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do .	22.435261720182794
The children , two girls of six and eight years old , and two younger boys , were to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane , who was the general favourite , and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way teaching them , playing with them , and loving them .	2.7261724016315814
He arranges the business just as he pleases .	126.09257234873176
I have a warm , unguarded temper , and I may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him , and to him , too freely .	8.66852594891179
Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth .	58.25749843352244
and had I been the rector of Longbourn , I should very strenuously have opposed it .	22.474884846891992
A little sea-bathing would set me up for ever .	91.36825855379278
a most convenient distance for the young ladies , who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week , to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner's shop just over the way .	4.992726435558252
Oh !	8965.45062507954
Elizabeth would not observe her ;	471.6471768839811
After sitting a few minutes , they were all sent to one of the windows , to admire the view , Collins attending them to point out its beauties , and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer .	3.969015281515796
The others then joined her , and expressed their admiration of his figure ;	35.307836105462044
I wish I could hear that you , my dearest friend , had any intention of making one in the croud , but of that I despair .	7.984003707356419
We will go as far as Meryton with you , said Catherine and Lydia .	29.64460657684533
I hope they will not meet at all .	126.3118417828892
Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom , which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family .	9.573322630154781
Collins knew not what to make of him .	132.5656056298359
One came from her books , and the other from her toilette .	45.8139790457681
Very well .	4366.227540289468
She could not determine how her mother would take it ;	69.21758740156314
And have you answered the letter ?	282.38495090954865
Pemberley was now Georgiana's home ;	471.56144177488665
I am very sensible , madam , of the hardship to my fair cousins , and could say much on the subject , but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate .	6.103537855302743
my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ?	5.49940462204067
Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House , whichever it might be , where Darcy then was .	11.230240821472977
Gracechurch-street , Sept .	1852.072171128788
All connection between us seemed now dissolved .	183.2378416279336
He keeps a man-servant , does he ?	182.92834490122445
It was lady Catherine de Bourgh .	299.2648646106788
She is so fond of Forster , said she , it will be quite shocking to send her away !	18.460109205944107
my dear Charlotte , impossible !	474.29516922766345
and I doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself , Darcy .	25.645175055666897
CHAPTER XIX .	4138.577761074046
and after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family .	34.628753133803556
What will be his surprise , thought she , when he knows who they are !	26.597511987384586
For a few moments , indeed , she felt that he would probably strike into some other path .	17.981710628519743
He was angry .	1854.7350382526906
A man who has once been refused !	184.08261050564533
most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman's education .	7.478630780801492
Upon my word , said Gardiner , I begin to be of your uncle's opinion .	28.17070737585866
She had no fear of its spreading farther , through his means .	43.06474859934757
Nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination , said Elizabeth .	35.4656594165641
Do you draw ?	1859.978696985612
You go to Brighton !	872.9280715099725
and the others were to meet us at the church .	68.92514204725015
No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you , can think any thing wanting .	25.152676573665246
He added , that Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present , to leave London , and promised to write again very soon .	11.510543318205759
How I long to see her !	292.163736505107
Elizabeth made no answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Darcy , and reading in her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it .	4.083620236395768
Miss Bingley saw , or suspected enough to be jealous ;	68.98191702537937
and , though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy's father , five years before , it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends , than she had been in the way of procuring .	4.245340411694788
The business of her life was to get her daughters married ;	55.93468946972384
Darcy took her advice , and did finish his letter .	68.89876585707493
Bingley was good looking and gentleman-like ;	283.4006310401524
Had not my own feelings decided against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man , who has been the means of ruining , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ?	3.2011486017562434
if I should ever go to Brighton , I would behave better than Lydia .	29.620613063249884
It is I believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world .	22.495612321140452
She felt it so ;	877.4907441577092
and when Bennet joined them at supper , his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was .	15.019553922061403
Elizabeth felt Jane's pleasure .	878.4044347855818
Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal , and felt persuaded of her sister's ready acquiescence .	21.727548528642156
But I will no longer importune my young cousin .	91.85369529640373
Then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce Bingley to her .	16.993122874795297
That he was really fond of Jane , she doubted no more than she had ever done ;	20.22139140102501
At present , however , I consider myself as quite fixed here .	44.90721353575395
a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification ;	69.04846192585065
Mary and Kitty were both with Bennet : one communication would , therefore , do for all .	19.0200744958939
unless when some barbarous neighbour , who could not be enough detested , had given him an invitation to dinner , which he thought himself obliged to accept .	7.478630780801492
Had she not seen him in Derbyshire , she might have supposed him capable of coming there , with no other view than what was acknowledged ;	8.752020130642421
She dreaded seeing Wickham again , and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible .	22.411817576399095
How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton !	35.31585366000564
why did she come ?	872.7545377705296
Darcy was writing , and Miss Bingley , seated near him , was watching the progress of his letter , and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister .	6.766238856023745
Why did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight ?	43.08006392578377
They must be a great loss to your family .	95.66658791421001
And on the gentlemen's approaching , one of the girls moved closer to her than ever , and said , in a whisper , The men shan't come and part us , I am determined .	5.748744192705097
and it was not till Easter-day , almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival , that they were honoured by such an attention , and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening .	4.773923350155565
Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room , and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless .	14.494331964800267
( by the bye , Forster and me are such friends ) and so she asked the two Harringtons to come , but Harriet was ill , and so Pen was forced to come by herself ;	5.097764742941932
The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow .	12.928291790018799
At first there seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely , for she was a most determined talker ;	17.80936831921804
They were of a respectable family in the north of England ;	53.754085064308306
though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy .	43.202433709714384
Bennet was not in the habit of walking , Mary could never spare time , but the remaining five set off together .	12.661776539234062
Accordingly , when she retired at night , she asked the chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place , what was the name of its proprietor , and with no little alarm , whether the family were down for the summer .	4.131071408793245
But if you will listen to his letter , you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself .	11.52378929837984
She is a very headstrong foolish girl , and does not know her own interest ;	26.141007996260385
I had often seen him in love before .	126.37746332374408
Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion , sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation .	9.781319940186668
consequently that she is aunt to the present Darcy .	91.32606463305149
Miss Bingley did the same ;	472.632969648191
Elizabeth did all she could , to shield him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification ;	4.573413150008141
In that county , there was enough to be seen , to occupy the chief of their three weeks ;	15.011733858278403
You and papa , and my sisters , must come down and see us .	29.54535617503997
but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley , she dropt all her resentment ;	13.548749240462772
for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire , and of his being gone into the regulars .	14.919350390221293
The motive professed , was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known , as to make it impossible for any young woman of character , to love or confide in him .	4.558772769697376
If he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare , he determined to make enquiries there , and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach .	4.161247662041799

I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say .	28.084290858633267
I do not trust my own partiality .	183.22468028469797
Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits .	58.26435177040904
In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her a present from my master ;	16.824631121451223
And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock .	37.98282767517205
You cannot be more than twenty , I am sure , therefore you need not conceal your age .	19.447792180713066
and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment .	8.482842340403034

But if you have got them to-day , said Elizabeth , my mother's purpose will be answered .	21.715829975223265
And when I returned home , the shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time .	16.84815138112612
I could not have parted with you , my Lizzy , to any one less worthy .	23.209081025486245
and he and Bennet spent the morning together , as had been agreed on .	29.570631011843936
made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow's debts , and got him his commission !	15.009175861060113
You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works , reports , performances and research .	12.290957361039037
On entering the room , he seemed to hesitate ;	95.71256582970867
I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it .	68.94898494931847
Sometime hence it will be all found out , and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before .	11.677736124474302
or had you intended any more serious consequence ?	126.32484791257149
I am trying to make it out .	192.97912633227313
I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet , she is really a very sweet girl , and I wish with all my heart she were well settled .	7.818623719802809
I am not one and twenty .	299.7960219275581
Will it not be advisable , before we proceed on this subject , to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request , as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties ?	4.490297054482045
I am afraid you do not like your pen .	98.70187724798312
Then , after a short silence , he continued , Lizzy , I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May , which , considering the event , shews some greatness of mind .	5.175030694868647
It was as follows : MY DEAR SIR , I feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire .	3.654572524264363
Her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved .	282.4280506904258
I admire all my three sons-in-law highly , said he .	68.87691576261868
I should be sorry indeed , if it were .	96.61152585948867
Darcy made no answer .	877.2576585321115
Darcy , you cannot deny the fact .	193.60639461503933
and within five miles of Lambton , Elizabeth found from her aunt , that Pemberley was situated .	18.995865344765782
I have never heard him say so ;	183.01050080048506
and his answering immediately to the last question Oh !	91.57567436485968
Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness , and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover , she could not prevent its frequently recurring .	6.858466615428246
Darcy mentioned his letter .	873.2494250048184
Kitty , to her very material advantage , spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters .	15.449571419793035
but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away , just as they were all getting so intimate together .	4.8856492956947
But I tell you what , Miss Lizzy , if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at all and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead .	3.399064076148121
I will not be interrupted .	506.53581675362375
I desire you will do no such thing .	126.08274271012002
Elizabeth did not know what to make of it .	104.92008680927542
Elizabeth said nothing , but it gratified her exceedingly ;	91.33824067289287
I will answer for it he never cared three straws about her .	43.0771538945163
I am grieved , indeed , cried Darcy ;	132.51333911906386
And now here's Bennet gone away , and I know he will fight Wickham , wherever he meets him , and then he will be killed , and what is to become of us all ?	5.3951542708662705
Gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her .	30.603309420048394
Yes if Darcy does not put it off again .	91.37003569617771
but it would not do ;	503.3738070475498
Since the shire were first quartered in Meryton , nothing but love , flirtation , and officers , have been in her head .	10.357305561962484
and , after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt , her resentment gave way , either to her affection for him , or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself ;	5.321238957606507
I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing .	35.319122188192374
I have been making the tour of the Park , he replied , as I generally do every year , and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage .	6.582411418971363
Perhaps he thought her too young .	282.75774442003564
The fishing scheme had been renewed the day before , and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon .	8.666881159139221
I am not so selfish , however , as to press for it , if inconvenient .	22.85599197712667
I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself .	126.22650714657132
What he told me was merely this ;	182.98185371827194
To Elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ;	4.317517717549338
Hill began instantly to express her joy .	182.9046321206164
but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes , and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt .	15.017453565276721
Indeed !	15945.850060918196
There is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King .	91.45466636537445
Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish ;	183.83636920649752
My dear Lizzy , do not give way to such feelings as these .	37.741315170514305
in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of every thing , she was still dear to him .	11.115463510445693
The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's match , which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true !	2.8312810903583365
A military life is not what I was intended for , but circumstances have now made it eligible .	16.807266723744867
And , besides , no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road .	22.491403611412426
She was roused from her seat , and her reflections , by some one's approach ;	25.15378143670814
She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken .	126.08868754034408
it is of no consequence .	474.70480968987323
Elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion , that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Bingley's invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's amusement ;	3.8098344016187524
In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty ;	31.81612879247557
A most delightful place !	873.359444853018
To Kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected .	44.7432009800377
We may compare our different opinions .	282.4748941873754
This will never do .	873.314200916417
the door was then allowed to be shut , and the carriage drove off .	30.607552074735523
such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her , and she began her song .	29.564049740678286
Lydia gaped as he opened the volume , and before he had , with very monotonous solemnity , read three pages , she interrupted him with , Do you know , mama , that my uncle Philips talks of turning away Richard , and if he does , Colonel Forster will hire him .	3.265502220952487
CHAPTER XVIII .	4353.740372381362
You know nothing of the matter .	301.8935566444843
Sir William did not say much .	283.79608068693244
She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico , muslin , and cambric , and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders , had not Jane , though with some difficulty , persuaded her to wait , till her father was at leisure to be consulted .	3.5393540107755435
but , had she still felt any , it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself , on seeing her again .	6.927009906674837
He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance , and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption ;	15.895129343078285
Insolent girl !	4743.677376410631
but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful .	43.22221559317379
While she spoke , Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words , or to distrust their meaning .	11.240392103360008
and when she had gone through the whole letter , though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two , put it hastily away , protesting that she would not regard it , that she would never look in it again .	4.347503761747411
Oh !	8965.45062507954
Painful recollections will intrude , which cannot , which ought not to be repelled .	31.21060020007523
Allowing for the common demands of the game , Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth , and she was very willing to hear him , though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told , the history of his acquaintance with Darcy .	3.6561726701082455
He cannot know what Darcy is .	282.36081194777387
With the officers !	1870.1488811875158
Charlotte says , she hardly ever does .	183.55008779214998
Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below .	73.76963771631965
I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady .	44.726732297095886
and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love .	11.244849277498039
Oh , yes !	1630.3553256278274
You have deprived the best years of his life , of that independence which was no less his due than his desert .	11.518729237289918
No , no I feel he may defy us there .	69.31408438713446
It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy .	75.11549244448875
untamed , unabashed , wild , noisy , and fearless .	68.87435935390347
You look pale .	1852.4813488728976
but , whenever she did catch a glimpse , she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said , she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed , however temporary its existence might prove , had at least outlived one day .	2.586899930726222
but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly .	7.64592814117968
If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew , I shall certainly not be kept from it , by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss De Bourgh .	5.497566119398012
but it is to the credit of his modesty .	91.94613930391381
He was at the same time haughty , reserved , and fastidious , and his manners , though well bred , were not inviting .	10.62898035361063
re-considering events , determining probabilities , and reconciling herself as well as she could , to a change so sudden and so important , fatigue , and a recollection of her long absence , made her at length return home ;	4.531486645816599
The evening conversation , when they were all assembled , had lost much of its animation , and almost all its sense , by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth .	6.965319110632969
CHAPTER II .	4138.577761074046
Can there be any other opinion on the subject ?	91.50792920719019
he will immediately comprehend what I must feel , and I rely upon his goodness .	25.15838481915762
Lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath ;	15.070504484948756
Depend upon it , my dear , that when there are twenty , I will visit them all .	19.55221802364134
She was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger , and wondered it had escaped her before .	12.28451765982937
It is highly improper .	873.3506133063007
He leaves out half his words , and blots the rest .	53.70065612780324
To complete the favourable impression , she then told him what Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia .	19.00137738015165
and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to , a wish of being better acquainted with them , was expressed towards the two eldest .	5.687654347428712
Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring ?	126.27687856816146
She looks sickly and cross .	471.6152006322248
Upon my word , Caroline , I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by imitation .	14.211491997030384
Who should suffer but myself ?	473.1130194100226
Your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach , that the contentment arising from them , is not of philosophy , but what is much better , of ignorance .	6.561972515630017
My father and mother knew nothing of that , they only felt how imprudent a match it must be .	15.035652691780012
I had much rather go in the coach .	126.37746332374408
The adieu is charity itself .	471.6236116866055
I am truly glad , dearest Lizzy , that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes ;	19.039319942740967
Collins , did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe's calling yesterday to thank me ?	29.624056843694984
He is now perhaps sorry for what he has done , and anxious to re-establish a character .	19.011340173225793
and if , as you were mounting your horse , a friend were to say , 'Bingley , you had better stay till next week , ' you would probably do it , you would probably not go and , at another word , might stay a month .	3.5506780090233936
I have heard from authority , which I thought as good , that it was left you conditionally only , and at the will of the present patron .	8.704077707507096
Collins was eloquent in her praise .	283.6226348556698
but Elizabeth saw , with admiration of his taste , that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine ;	18.349138911735253
Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room ;	31.79952528680696
As they walked across the lawn towards the river , Elizabeth turned back to look again ;	21.774856469723595
Oh , Lord !	1856.8414363661354
Well , Jane , make haste and tell us ;	100.32429248773838
If you believed it impossible to be true , said Elizabeth , colouring with astonishment and disdain , I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far .	8.352964876324055
I know you do ;	874.3430969941132
In confirmation of this , she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected , without actually naming her authority , but stating it to be such as might be relied on .	4.734435602421473
Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town ;	53.709682471599315
They were all astonished ;	874.3785723694484
I cannot believe it .	874.1999772153572
adding , with a significant smile , I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here .	6.581110677942426
He answered her in the same style , and the subject dropped .	43.03973758073568
I would not be so fastidious as you are , cried Bingley , for a kingdom !	23.597428794705717
Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ;	53.73400089067932
Indeed I am .	1872.487075578139
Your profusion makes me saving ;	471.9878147802151
She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of ill humour , which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her .	5.218232696717487
Oh !	8965.45062507954
She is a very fine-looking woman !	285.2517020313129
and there was no necessity for such attention .	126.08232441121416
I was sometimes quite provoked , but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane , and for their sakes had patience with her .	9.56151392515948
Are you so severe upon your own sex , as to doubt the possibility of all this ?	19.051528491377923
but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham ;	22.44519995762045
and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you .	6.235403409814085
That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment , as to refuse his daughter a privilege , without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid , exceeded all that she could believe possible .	4.660664551406676
It must not be thought of .	283.3106766960848
Oh , Jane , had we been less secret , had we told what we knew of him , this could not have happened !	9.78738740444423
Our instrument is a capital one , probably superior to You shall try it some day .	21.767711172373616
You thought the waiter must not hear , as if he cared !	43.040461764169045
said Elizabeth to herself .	880.6912961151319
He protested that except Lady Catherine and her daughter , he had never seen a more elegant woman ;	18.728009320770404
He was her dear Wickham on every occasion ;	126.19389615435114
You must contrive to send somebody .	282.80459531343325
Let me never see either one or the other again !	69.06481795283676
But why Darcy came so often to the Parsonage , it was more difficult to understand .	22.41176388439778
Oh !	8965.45062507954
It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Darcy himself ;	35.38399963857012
There is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair , on which I do not reflect with satisfaction ;	12.937707692929505
A great many indeed , said her companion with a sigh .	53.95958298005524
Yes , my youngest is not sixteen .	183.15959188304265
Yes , Sir , I know I am .	132.64812611426748
She tried , however , to compose herself to answer him with patience , when he should have done .	15.865765433202922
Sir William staid only a week at Hunsford ;	126.64175158863814
The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him .	25.145183341833867
his brow contracted , his air gloomy .	183.41372786452467
Only let me assure you , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage .	10.294160682713187
Every thing nourishes what is strong already .	184.24714038882303
how I laughed !	1857.7298224708
but you must lend us the money , for we have just spent ours at the shop out there .	15.09368495302676
His friend had left him that morning for London , but was to return home in ten days time .	15.012319741156213
When Bennet arrived , he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure .	32.78987495482448
I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character , in a part of the world , where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit .	4.9107757134236225
But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham .	56.05288565858667
Darcy had walked away to another part of the room .	69.12679539800816
Was not this some excuse for incivility , if I was uncivil ?	43.035708093730584
Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father , who had intended to purchase an estate , but did not live to do it .	6.354553704335121
that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that one false step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful , and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex .	3.65810764823037
Our importance , our respectability in the world , must be affected by the wild volatility , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia's character .	8.03760343216297
I have found out , said he , by a singular accident , that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness .	9.69571199827931
My dearest sister , now be be serious .	126.80167513761295
but Charlotte , she soon found , was depending on the plan , and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty .	6.92263069458652
to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where , and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with .	9.514209580526112
Their mutual affection will steady them ;	282.6147487674214
He came , and in such very good time , that the ladies were none of them dressed .	16.80359520899542
and certainly ought not to have appeared ;	192.92972504761497
and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , I have not yet learnt to condemn them .	10.864648398699616
But , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes time , and then we all set out .	15.6929926218054
and if the second , I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire .	19.008460417816135
Yes , she called yesterday with her father .	126.24057867888969
It is from Miss Bingley , said Jane , and then read it aloud .	33.15845714892845
My poor father !	1852.8271467853008
Elizabeth instantly read her feelings , and at that moment solicitude for Wickham , resentment against his enemies , and every thing else gave way before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness .	4.830016296728679
A thousand things may arise in six months !	126.13980579834178
We do not suffer by accident .	282.47489418737564
and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters , in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about .	6.236298329727908
Your's , c .	1649.7163939346244
Elizabeth almost stared at her .	471.6471768839811
Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time , but Darcy they had only seen at church .	11.546058023803008
Gracechurch-street , Monday , August 2 .	282.32115989634974
but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me .	25.177908170311376
and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia's flight , on her own folly alone .	19.57705419302471
She was received , however , very politely by them ;	68.9115167527982
You must not be too severe upon yourself , replied Elizabeth .	54.00277470181508
The country , said Darcy , can in general supply but few subjects for such a study .	20.53566593355059
She had only to say in reply , that they had wandered about , till she was beyond her own knowledge .	13.327752709777277
His pride , in that direction , may be of service , if not to himself , to many others , for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by .	5.216103773033802
I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation , replied Elizabeth , but it is not in my power to accept it .	10.734847627816894
But he found , in reply to this question , that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country .	7.07031720243957
Pride , observed Mary , who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections , is a very common failing I believe .	11.50985053443852
My friend has an excellent understanding though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Collins as the wisest thing she ever did .	9.78103481475308
This was not very consoling to Bennet , and , therefore , instead of making any answer , she went on as before , I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate .	5.324900325037238
in which case you may be sure of my pardon .	69.07177390249679
the windows are full west .	472.2154332506154
neither did the apothecary , who arrived about the same time , think it at all advisable .	20.175544635143865
The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this .	31.212863248732347
Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls , and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him .	6.5613075140735155
You deserve no such attention .	471.6466798211475
for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend's dislike would vanish , if she could suppose him to be in her power .	7.432803200192392
The next morning , as she was going down stairs , she was met by her father , who came out of his library with a letter in his hand .	7.0442123905989815
Yet it did , and even a third .	126.44169118455625
I am glad he is gone .	283.88775564544255
There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself .	10.927460445059424
With such rivals for the notice of the fair , as Wickham and the officers , Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance ;	10.839880121385164
but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only .	54.14052612127515
Who could about such a nasty little freckled thing ?	91.54632739902162
A small sum could not do all this .	126.13980579834201
and having to relate such a thing of his sister !	68.87671581652873
Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt .	126.09540457175159
I almost envy you the pleasure , and yet I believe it would be too much for me , or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle .	6.7635547341074815
Oh !	8965.45062507954
Poor Charlotte !	4767.690094325646
She grew absolutely ashamed of herself .	282.3506627855391
Oh !	8965.45062507954
We must trespass a little longer on your kindness .	91.7475032991084
Philips's vulgarity was another , and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance ;	35.3051414270065
I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back .	16.81350770857669
Had the late Darcy liked me less , his son might have borne with me better ;	21.729877513783592
Oh !	8965.45062507954
It would not be easy , indeed , to catch their expression , but their colour and shape , and the eye-lashes , so remarkably fine , might be copied .	6.7698862477110655
And poor Darcy !	1852.6301645352398
You are lucky in having such a master .	126.21193111134285
Is this to be endured !	472.51125484192454
Mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted ;	56.02818113647296
It was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re-animated , and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's attractions .	5.43614421368615
I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side , for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing , if she had been well looked after .	5.490079505641452
It is Bingley I am sure .	300.6004775791294
It cannot be for me , it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened .	16.85719593652444
He had by that time reached it also , and holding out a letter , which she instinctively took , said with a look of haughty composure , I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you .	4.2269248078577775
the former continued the subject , by saying , But tell me all and every thing about it , which I have not already heard .	9.29629164225167
my dear Lydia , she cried , when shall we meet again ?	49.58126567342553
and sleeping one night on the road , reached Longbourn by dinner-time the next day .	25.144102465350898
Yes , I call it a very easy distance .	91.4363844262028
and then till her sister came down , she had to listen to all he had to say , of his own happiness , and of Jane's perfections ;	7.332929295970853
Elizabeth immediately began playing again .	471.6471768839811
Good gracious !	4123.65795852664
To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh ;	69.23581205008841
where , where is my uncle ?	284.1273713928716
And with no one to speak to , of what I felt , no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had !	5.126558800997751
How could I ever think her like her nephew ?	91.64051844218127
Within doors there was Lady Catherine , books , and a billiard table , but gentlemen cannot be always within doors ;	12.280591974049722
A house in town !	873.3594448530172
It seemed like wilful ill-nature , or a voluntary penance , for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away , but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her .	3.928374163645492
I am going to Gretna Green , and if you cannot guess with who , I shall think you a simpleton , for there is but one man in the world I love , and he is an angel .	5.083751431963647
But perhaps , added he , stopping in his walk , and turning towards her , these offences might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design .	3.830098755341915
Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten ;	91.79318916313707
Well , well , and so Bingley is coming down , sister , ( for Philips first brought her the news ) Well , so much the better .	7.349252291348226
We never had any governess .	471.84157518954925
and no change was visible in either , except that the loss of her favourite sister , or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business , had given something more of fretfulness than usual , to the accents of Kitty .	4.039525792933541
With the mention of Derbyshire , there were many ideas connected .	53.97215305822057
and detestable as such a step must make her were it known , she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go .	9.181272063207874
He seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologised for his intrusion , by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within .	6.922704627177892
for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce .	36.747581649133956
With a stronger voice she soon added , I have this comfort immediately , that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side , and that it has done no harm to any one but myself .	4.525609104862025
and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane , received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth .	10.017097299869647
Collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure , and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview , with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied , since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character .	2.879616993471897
but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy's opinion , and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities , by which some part of her family were connected with that corps .	2.671788855416302
I suppose you have heard of it ;	192.93041436051487
VOL .	13586.708929614973
and , though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene .	5.155606845779037
added Elizabeth ;	4743.677376410631
In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton and see how every body went on ;	11.232740376726412
She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject , and related , with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration , the shocking rudeness of Darcy .	7.203833786560564
and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource , if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family , were unfavourably answered .	8.3942928887025
But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible ;	53.89700252197677
I believe I have now told you every thing .	96.04858588034674
He did trace them easily to Clapham , but no farther ;	53.84551185122903
This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers , but Bennet , who quarrelled with no compliments , answered most readily , You are very kind , sir , I am sure ;	5.28034053409487
And gathering her work together , she was hastening away , when Elizabeth called out , Dear Ma'am , do not go .	11.229506310218511
for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him .	16.168089718850418
Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy , and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps .	11.529346084635876
On the gentlemen's appearing , her colour increased ;	126.46739859736594
Oh !	8965.45062507954
yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said , You are mistaken , Darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way , than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner .	2.821620807635741
and then thought no more of the matter : and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them , restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike .	6.5645736543972
and in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard .	9.58219802382274
as good natured , and as unaffected , though not quite so chatty .	35.44763003157291
for of what use could it apparently be to any one , that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him , should then be overthrown ?	7.633817835999068
Oh !	8965.45062507954
He could number the fields in every direction , and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump .	11.25419909680546
Bennet had very often wished , before this period of his life , that , instead of spending his whole income , he had laid by an annual sum , for the better provision of his children , and of his wife , if she survived him .	3.764713945319492
His sisters were fine women , with an air of decided fashion .	45.75747194035945
On the following Monday , Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife , who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn .	8.40332098431424
Kitty has no discretion in her coughs , said her father ;	58.35985051938126
she really rejoiced at it .	471.9644388865048
By many significant looks and silent entreaties , did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance , but in vain ;	11.518952576684308
He answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily .	5.0420733586890245
and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion , that whenever Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate , it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at James's .	4.813363296415921
Miss Lucas is married and settled .	282.4947384091897
Bingley was ready , Georgiana was eager , and Darcy determined , to be pleased .	25.19833776958841
and she could do nothing but think , and think with wonder , of Darcy's civility , and above all , of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister .	6.354228504779053
Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight , and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister .	10.60784422887085
The good news quickly spread through the house ;	126.09045440218053
Let us hope , therefore , that her being there may teach her her own insignificance .	21.731988175228032
He seldom appeared really animated .	471.6336941039698
Having now a good house and very sufficient income , he intended to marry ;	30.679998626553132
You refuse , then , to oblige me .	126.09530015792555
Miss Bingley I am sure cannot .	299.7318163212005
and , moreover , to enter into an engagement of allowing her , during your life , one hundred pounds per annum .	11.232513664183198
After sitting a little while with Jane , on Miss Bingley's appearance and invitation , the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour .	7.969883788267814
names , facts , every thing mentioned without ceremony .	91.32606463305149
Lady Catherine seemed pleased .	874.7388730060378
Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest .	183.06828802218902
I have not that pain .	473.2883472460448
The ladies were somewhat more fortunate , for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window , that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse .	6.687963816715159
he had a pleasant countenance , and easy , unaffected manners .	53.87968977440232
and I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body .	15.014853899690726
his civility , therefore , was most prompt in inviting Collins to join his daughters in their walk ;	17.320821870211997
But I knew I should persuade you at last .	91.38626285786306
though it was not put in as it ought to be .	53.99071139049747
the agitations of former partiality entirely so .	183.11924784020894
but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune , part from her authoritative manner , and the rest from the pride of her nephew , who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class .	3.5505459520790423
She was not the better pleased with his gallantry , from the idea it suggested of something more .	16.86214014613461
Sir William could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves .	15.469784671486847
The letter was to this effect : MY DEAR LIZZY , I wish you joy .	26.083881701410203
Your own heart , your own conscience , must tell you why I come .	29.557107604761622
without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person ;	91.32606463305149
and to Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction .	91.71090181370944
I wonder what he can be doing there .	126.4958453889397
Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment ;	126.65984221136443
What , all five out at once ?	182.98185371827176
Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance , when you were in Kent ?	29.67917495552758
After walking several miles in a leisurely manner , and too busy to know any thing about it , they found at last , on examining their watches , that it was time to be at home .	5.236509043057613
but she does not know , no one can know how much I suffer from what she says .	17.30669857469803
Wickham , after a few moments , touched his hat a salutation which Darcy just deigned to return .	19.37408603538385
But , Lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it .	36.64621333635892
Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss De Bourgh ate , pressing her to try some other dish , and fearing she were indisposed .	8.299057738918526
Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage .	29.557107604761622
But when her mother was gone , Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters .	13.835896328456483
What a stroke was this for poor Jane !	126.49126052535027
and she had barely time to express her satisfaction , and prepare for such a visitor , when Bingley's quick step was heard on the stairs , and in a moment he entered the room .	5.563234707059949
Yes ;	11559.025432404986
Oh , yes !	1630.3553256278274
Such a change in a man of so much pride , excited not only astonishment but gratitude for to love , ardent love , it must be attributed ;	7.346688159264085
I am sure , she added , if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and suffers a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without exception , the sweetest temper I ever met with .	2.9727300228474225
She was confident of having performed her duty , and to fret over unavoidable evils , or augment them by anxiety , was no part of her disposition .	7.329570024382594
You will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one .	43.284914796683076
She is a handsome girl , about fifteen or sixteen , and I understand highly accomplished .	21.762294905888574
repeated the other , as she ran into her room to prepare .	43.035708093730584
Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them ;	182.93276980679664
She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever ;	69.07718739224596
Lady Catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us , were the means of removing all my doubts .	21.725573643073957
I expected to find a more reasonable young woman .	91.32968036912261
Darcy , only for a few minutes to take leave , but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour , hoping for her return , and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found .	4.284666275687838
Give me farther particulars .	872.7545377705296
do not repeat what I then said .	194.06063677262608
That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain , but I will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears .	6.353995424984853
Gardiner looked at her niece , desirous of knowing how she , whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its acceptance , but Elizabeth had turned away her head .	5.943763530406832
He really believed , that were it not for the inferiority of her connections , he should be in some danger .	12.60072892683938
Her ladyship received them civilly , but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else ;	9.553456140678447
Collins , said she , speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter ;	38.56738732955582
He is just what a young man ought to be , said she , sensible , good humoured , lively ;	15.821894858826006
And when we do return , it shall not be like other travellers , without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing .	9.105409629375483
Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection .	91.43902927083862
He simpers , and smirks , and makes love to us all .	43.03973758073568
I cannot understand it .	874.1999772153572
Can you , yourself , Lizzy , so wholly give him up , as to believe him capable of it ?	13.905572736636186
She was a woman of mean understanding , little information , and uncertain temper .	29.555169005799772
said Elizabeth , but the terms , I suppose , must be complied with .	34.63641911563479
Yes , Miss Bennet , interest ;	345.2880354092458
The visit was returned in due form .	182.92503594593404
But Jane was to go home with her , and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation .	15.479193984035215
They were ignorant , idle , and vain .	132.6526943645514
Yes .	15911.913783513044
accompanied by a violent yawn .	471.56144177488665
Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other .	91.32606463305149
But who was your mother ?	471.61294093744067
Then pray speak aloud .	875.3628094531122
but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent .	29.544356589029103
And when her sisters abused it as ugly , she added , with perfect unconcern , Oh !	21.546582379632166
But if I go on , I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem .	15.452072818159067
and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners , which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball .	7.327827909662955
when it became apparent , that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match .	5.748012002664779
and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance .	68.9786487104967
But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world , replied Darcy .	14.845034584506454
and added , that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage .	14.489399609130615
She highly approved his forbearance , and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other , as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn , and during the walk , he particularly attended to her .	3.4600528164112254
True .	14555.1982975329
Bennet , through the assistance of servants , contrived to have the earliest tidings of it , that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side , might be as long as it could .	5.399928969977065
Indeed you are mistaken .	874.6884126089549
Lizzy , to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family !	15.051402027890862
Not a soul knew of it , but and Forster , and Kitty and me , except my aunt , for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns ;	6.704090939902008
From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage , it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew ;	8.320385338105657
That he was not a good-tempered man , had been her firmest opinion .	35.40228172623679
She longed to see Philips , the Lucases , and all their other neighbours , and to hear herself called Wickham , by each of them ;	8.777342209772547
Does your charge give you much trouble ?	183.9845261424681
It has been a very agreeable day , said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth .	35.5493763513085
Can I have the carriage ?	472.84243660369384
CHAPTER V Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth ;	25.151744076210296
at his own house especially , and of a Sunday evening when he has nothing to do .	19.576588253152863
When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance , and courting the good opinion of people , with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace ;	7.1774269728896325
And that made the men suspect something , and then they soon found out what was the matter .	17.296717431094496
It must be something particular , to take him there at this time of year .	25.285745531573237
In what an amiable light does this place him !	91.35200710679793
The envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , hot pressed paper , well covered with a lady's fair , flowing hand ;	10.330526262708958
but the shortness of her stay , and yet more , the alteration of her manner , would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer .	9.301063214344264
Perhaps it would have been better ;	328.2921106694145
Have not you always hated him ?	283.27310654663313
but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence , what chance could there be of improvement ?	18.996496412417027
I am not now to learn , replied Collins , with a formal wave of the hand , that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first applies for their favour ;	3.846067753632616
for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible .	68.89656332451749
The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming ;	10.3822402105007
Elizabeth , who was left by herself , now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled , that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation .	5.217930359954508
She could think of nothing else , and yet whether Bingley's regard had really died away , or were suppressed by his friends' interference ;	9.908097448061879
And she was only sixteen last June .	182.94278039473133
I think you said she was a widow , sir ?	72.07344884891252
Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine , who called out to know what they were talking of .	17.323896848303683
I do assure you , that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain .	19.716086370139752
Many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter ;	69.10230811829969
Lady Catherine , I have nothing farther to say .	95.79017152375948
and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible .	5.358617768253121
yet there had been that in his voice , which was not like ease .	29.620613063249884
But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Darcy's pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers ;	10.597047411482249
He then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not tired , and they stood together on the lawn .	10.597224288860042
The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn .	91.8020637105667
Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these ;	71.92368775476578
Risk any thing rather than her displeasure ;	192.92160119218158
There was now an interest , however , in believing the housekeeper ;	44.7885761465361
But his pride , his abominable pride , his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane , his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging , though he could not justify it , and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Wickham , his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny , soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited .	2.543300630887383
They are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses ;	21.74824786722929
Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's .	91.64850618103364
Well , I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Bingley .	44.712029068510454
No governess !	4748.249617890625
But our visitor was very obstinate .	282.34942266949554
As a clergyman , moreover , I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence ;	7.651483847338618
When she is secure of him , there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses .	14.522165820069068
She had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses , which he had already had the honour of preaching before her .	10.733343436541082
He drew a chair near her .	282.36081194777387
But whatever may be the sentiments which Wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character .	8.885701193688668
Georgiana's reception of them was very civil ;	182.9046321206164
Oh !	8965.45062507954
But how did he account for it ?	182.92153389378294
Bennet was really in a most pitiable state .	126.36327072512756
My father is gone to London , and Jane has written to beg my uncle's immediate assistance , and we shall be off , I hope , in half an hour .	6.8968664146516865
Mary was the only daughter who remained at home ;	91.50792920719019
It is not Bingley , said her husband ;	132.97554469027446
how unlucky !	4759.982675743833
Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as Elizabeth half expected Bingley to do , he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine's visit .	4.644197626236365
Do not copy , display , perform , distribute or redistribute this electronic work , or any part of this electronic work , without prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1 .	6.109853643442704
But , whatever may be their own wishes , it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother's .	15.6929926218054
He then went away , and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself .	7.73502205458473
is she handsome ?	1852.072171128788
She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could , provided he chose with discretion ;	14.58206210512615
she knew not how to believe that Darcy could be so unworthy of Bingley's regard ;	26.505695526690626
I dare say you will find him very agreeable .	92.09428485886714
That is right .	1856.533927838281
and what can he have to say ?	182.91233416528254
His disposition must be dreadful .	471.7859605297108
But the fact is , that being , as I am , to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father , ( who , however , may live many years longer , ) I could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters , that the loss to them might be as little as possible , when the melancholy event takes place which , however , as I have already said , may not be for several years .	2.155028362602032
and you shall all have a bowl of punch , to make merry at her wedding .	21.755915247002182
Till the next morning , however , she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance .	21.066737093343324
If you are a good girl for the next ten years , I will take you to a review at the end of them .	10.489322360881786
Elizabeth loved absurdities , but she had known Sir William's too long .	43.04048948406033
Women fancy admiration means more than it does .	126.07739456675078
Your's sincerely , c .	877.3807182427697
I shall offer to pay him to-morrow ;	183.1376054435776
said she .	4174.740194871325
But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Wickham , when she read with somewhat clearer attention , a relation of events , which , if true , must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself , her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition .	2.6224332840474163
Almost as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life .	16.310994665998592
Oh !	8965.45062507954
and his sisters are charming women .	283.28602913593846
and will probably be much talked of .	182.91233416528254
and soon afterwards Darcy , drawing near Elizabeth , said to her Do not you feel a great inclination , Miss Bennet , to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel ?	6.514575583303998
I had not been long in Hertfordshire , before I saw , in common with others , that Bingley preferred your eldest sister , to any other young woman in the country .	6.3682142779710995
It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again !	29.54477013606777
You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this .	19.00774886789041
The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed , the unacknowledged were silent .	53.69991330566006
Very true ;	4761.404895261674
I should be sorry to think so ill of him , in the very beginning of our relationship .	18.438641534739197
But on returning to the drawing-room , when her letter was finished , she saw , to her infinite surprise , there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her .	5.486938205637333
and Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected .	91.32939756883732
He then said , I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly .	22.4589589280386
four or five thousand a year .	299.1088496668921
they are all silly and ignorant like other girls ;	92.07386318659678
Collins was not a sensible man , and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society ;	12.81675901392493
I am going to open the instrument , Eliza , and you know what follows .	25.731963205750414
His fear of her , has always operated , I know , when they were together ;	23.8738274881544
nor will I be dissuaded from it .	183.55008779214998
Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it , and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards ;	8.14268089837865
You have liked many a stupider person .	183.20865933704724
I will go to Meryton , said she , as soon as I am dressed , and tell the good , good news to my sister Philips .	9.479706679268803
He brought it with him for us to see .	91.3363258970804
I have done with you from this very day .	91.37187596038461
and thither also went Wickham , undoubtedly by design ;	91.32939756883732
there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance !	69.36104078012565

Yet he knew to the contrary himself .	183.4738460516449
but that after their removal , it had been every where discussed ;	43.188611175183986
but since we see every day that where there is affection , young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune , from entering into engagements with each other , how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if I am tempted , or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist ?	2.753295882535201
yes , his misfortunes have been great indeed .	132.8594464147128
she repented , though she hardly knew of what .	91.38329286713865
And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him , without any reason .	13.891070466223772
Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse , and that she could not leave her .	14.615105594866556
But people themselves alter so much , that there is something new to be observed in them for ever .	16.311778423521737
Miss Darcy and her brother appeared , and this formidable introduction took place .	35.46139319309877
She related the subject of the pictures , the dimensions of the rooms , and the price of the furniture , in vain .	10.729314244712912
Yes , all of them , I think .	126.24057867888969
If I was to go through the world , I could not meet with a better .	23.158819215659445
What , is he coming home , and without poor Lydia !	53.712667798680656
At our time of life , it is not so pleasant I can tell you , to be making new acquaintance every day ;	10.923484226293402
I would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ;	15.031242181314031
I talked about the dance , and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room , or the number of couples .	8.117671760913046
I had not thought Darcy so bad as this though I have never liked him , I had not thought so very ill of him I had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general , but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge , such injustice , such inhumanity as this !	3.121978051584638
E Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg : 1 .	44.72525668522279
and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn , they would be going there for ever .	19.047577931126494
As for the gentleman himself , his feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence .	5.684146592202897
inmates of the same house , sharing the same amusements , objects of the same parental care .	18.995413237366122
But what is to be done about Pemberley ?	139.21267361450163
In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage .	91.35200710679793
And men take care that they should .	182.94278039473133
Elizabeth accepted their company , and the three young ladies set off together .	36.620759639580555
They may be modified and printed and given away you may do practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks .	16.804757946452693
Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball ;	8.503809835931735
She plays and sings all day long .	182.92227550805146
Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern .	126.85357122609287
The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl .	53.69991330566006
and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries , which Jane was equally eager to satisfy .	13.53244098166556
such an openness and gentleness in his manner .	126.07739456675078
The discomposure of spirits , which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into , could not be easily overcome ;	17.29580866379148
Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages .	13.556787760337585
and even Jane , who believed still less of it , became almost hopeless , more especially as the time was now come , when if they had gone to Scotland , which she had never before entirely despaired of , they must in all probability have gained some news of them .	3.3758891890713096
But I wonder how long you would have gone on , if you had been left to yourself .	17.808871756616472
You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you .	30.615642433017566
Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Collins , and I will never see you again if you do .	11.529854094102893
whichever were the case , though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference , her sister's situation remained the same , her peace equally wounded .	7.060829867358011
To be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation , had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town ;	12.64388958757593
The possibility of Collins's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two ;	11.893353280086174
coaxed and threatened her by turns .	282.32115989634974
The housekeeper came ;	1852.3706106999628
She was of great use and comfort to us all , and lady Lucas has been very kind ;	17.300983386364475
and I trust I am resigned .	282.54371249729735
Perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her .	68.95422496861939
if that is all , I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire ;	16.839468084160746
Not that I care about it , though .	127.31432266237701
Howsoever that may be , you are grievously to be pitied , in which opinion I am not only joined by Collins , but likewise by lady Catherine and her daughter , to whom I have related the affair .	4.932261038737422
Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public .	68.89876585707488
The comfort to her , of the regiment's approaching removal , was indeed beyond expression .	25.145183341833867
so easily guided that his worth was invaluable ;	126.34641463727803
his estate there is a noble one .	183.41372786452467
and as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together .	9.560765554354665
Wickham !	15933.551511975253
but Lydia , with perfect indifference , continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter , and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day , as he was going the next morning to London .	5.389309131099255
and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected .	22.411097827463767
No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph .	68.90754398388195
Assistance is impossible ;	1852.072171128788
They had , therefore , many acquaintance in common ;	91.54571169826887
To my fancy , it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men .	19.00137738015165
Bennet said only , Nonsense , nonsense !	182.99319233797297
But does not Jane correspond with the sister ?	126.08821285810164
I cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought , nor their offences against myself .	13.532834346269727
But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood , and take Pemberley for a kind of model .	11.513914269758569
Lord bless me !	1852.072171128788
till , roused to resentment by his subsequent language , she lost all compassion in anger .	21.767711172373616
How much you must have gone through !	183.8680016407017
Lady Catherine was a tall , large woman , with strongly-marked features , which might once have been handsome .	15.492517650000686
But , perhaps he could not in her mother's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt .	16.994869246711804
Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse .	126.44169118455625
Who would have thought she could be so thin and small !	53.80958477293595
And so was I You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner .	21.758055049885265
It is such a spur to one's genius , such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind .	12.283697758890693
That she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head .	29.551889971986824
it was impossible not to long to know .	136.67518238415263
She will drop the acquaintance entirely .	283.3027089153531
If you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits , and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment .	4.217478259485886
In the gallery there were many family portraits , but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger .	12.29502394230018
Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome ;	30.639536728133
We will settle with your father about the money afterwards ;	69.17228367091273
Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment .	474.3358253523056
Bennet had no turn for economy , and her husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income .	13.555031535174988
He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him , nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity ;	7.061169861269033
and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time , than as she hoped that , by Caroline's not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him .	3.8798132435352297
But when she read , and re-read with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu , so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate .	3.680472472028531
As for their mother , Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will , and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure , which astonished her husband and daughters .	5.939658643253613
The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough ;	43.03917530227505
The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors , and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife , was exactly what he had wished for ;	5.684503715723143
Teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind !	126.07739456675078
She would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions .	53.941574082901006
This will not do , said Elizabeth .	183.87714540163515
Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage , and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at Rosings .	6.927399887582709
He has the promise of an ensigncy in General 's regiment , now quartered in the North .	19.599668982400456
and covering her face with her handkerchief , Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else ;	22.827969282894067
It was a handsome modern building , well situated on rising ground .	43.12892050981855
Oh , brother , how kind you are !	126.28600967134444
But if you are really innocent and ignorant , I must be more explicit .	29.592518844259214
Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she ceased speaking , replied thus , My dear Miss Elizabeth , I have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding , but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity , and those which regulate the clergy ;	2.3760171872824114
That is exactly what I should have supposed of you , said Elizabeth .	36.77950435249143
If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is , I shall know what to think .	14.27674969898586
If she does not object to it , why should we ?	57.2934491261848
Having been frequently in company with him since her return , agitation was pretty well over ;	23.625118671847947
Philips visited them all , and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before .	18.995413237366122
Yours , c .	1714.7867885791668
and so fervently did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets , which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity .	3.105047194185232
Louisa , you will not mind my waking Hurst .	100.16870898673686
I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much , and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help .	6.977804410600843
but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on .	20.20079081231168
Thank you , Sir , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me .	36.718932344809
I think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements .	53.800555183173024
shall I get you one ?	471.56144177488665
Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication .	6.721301150275332
CHAPTER II .	4138.577761074046
If your master would marry , you might see more of him .	43.045299453804446
From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane , and were indebted to Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along , and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton , which he never failed coming to inform them of , though it happened almost every day .	3.096310489337387
With three younger sisters grown up , replied Elizabeth smiling , your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it .	13.529888802704605
and now , because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds , you want to find out that he is mercenary .	8.687387760240503
Elizabeth , at work in the opposite corner , saw it all with great delight .	26.01146028286845
We now come to the point .	299.27172547457155
Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone ;	15.009175861060113
It had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought to be imitated , though it could not be equalled , by some exertion of politeness on their side ;	2.6828283170256366
Collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed .	44.86260421323613
If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set forth in this agreement , you must obtain permission in writing from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael Hart , the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark .	3.563491890015484
The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions .	21.716896916608633
He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt's , where his regret and vexation , and the concern of every body was well talked over .	6.235273218514612
These causes must be stated , though briefly .	126.40321939341025
A little time therefore .	873.3594448530172
I did not wink at you .	283.7536072593673
Some people call him proud ;	474.24960150590704
Darcy only smiled ;	1853.239096846129
and Collins have a comfortable income , but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance .	4.816042695830827
Elizabeth particularly , who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy , was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied .	4.830016296728679
I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun .	43.073593297536526
for in a quarter of an hour's t te- -t te with Bennet before breakfast , a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house , and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes , that a mistress for it might be found at Longbourn , produced from her , amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement , a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on .	2.6620256457473763
nor will such behaviour as this , ever induce me to be explicit .	35.390339101859105
Upon my word , Sir , cried Elizabeth , your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration .	15.803208202063903
Gardiner was a sensible , gentleman-like man , greatly superior to his sister , as well by nature as education .	14.114695220057879
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly .	126.09045440218053
You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles , for you are wasting your time with me .	13.52525810017634
though I thought it would be very good fun if I was .	46.6612092720263
Who is to fight Wickham , and make him marry her , if he comes away ?	22.86492490945681
She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country .	43.19141729583832
Bennet treated the matter differently .	471.831291535387
Follies and nonsense , whims and inconsistencies do divert me , I own , and I laugh at them whenever I can .	11.50985053443852
Gardiner abused her stupidity .	873.8437554172109
You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine , but which I have never acknowledged .	13.52525810017634
His character is thereby complete .	475.0796661376387
and Miss Lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon that establishment were gained .	8.480928519148392
but Sir William's good breeding carried him through it all ;	68.8800050922285
My youngest sister has left all her friends has eloped ;	68.89015060068674
I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments ;	18.99590370590729
and without any intention of coming back again .	132.48183939191225
and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments .	91.6086534669001
They will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to Longbourn ;	29.63988347018131
Elizabeth looked archly , and turned away .	193.88158135686206
I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world , and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns .	13.572878310571426
But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed , so doubtful , so indefinite , that it gives me very little idea .	9.58125986073393
A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request , without waiting for arguments to reason one into it .	9.558674518665901
so handsome !	4761.404895261674
The dinner too in its turn was highly admired ;	91.33489401897373
CHAPTER XVII .	4138.577761074046
one knows exactly what to think .	284.1273713928716
Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure ;	126.438697106093
It was a rational scheme to be sure !	126.42859965212689
though her spirits are greatly shaken .	282.7151032780209
As they passed through the hall , Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and drawing-room , and pronouncing them , after a short survey , to be decent looking rooms , walked on .	5.5248116729175285
CHAPTER V I have been thinking it over again , Elizabeth , said her uncle , as they drove from the town ;	11.231197879048432
Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane .	44.77135389291238
She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage , and had a few minutes' conversation with Charlotte , but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out .	8.856606847955646
But he had given a reason for his interference , which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief .	19.616630448192492
But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted .	21.801897453574252
and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself , is heightened into something still more interesting , from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister .	6.236976784198151
Upon this information , they instantly passed through the hall once more , and ran across the lawn after their father , who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock .	4.856694409666764
and Gardiner smiled .	1852.1848244867297
Do not you want to know who has taken it ?	69.02324464945525
While they were dressing , he came two or three times to their different doors , to recommend their being quick , as Lady Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner .	5.398725442597218
and as soon as they were in the parlour , he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode , and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment .	6.076561072405444
He was directly invited to join their party , but he declined it , observing , that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together , with either of which motives his joining them would interfere .	3.855768437471618
pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before .	68.87435935390347
I am sorry to say it of them , but so it is .	35.95006142541858
Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat , he suddenly addressed her with , I hope Bingley will like it Lizzy .	10.33000970409017
1 .	10898.860396037358
There is one point , on which I want your advice .	55.99940520827686
They then sat down , and when her enquiries after Rosings were made , seemed in danger of sinking into total silence .	11.229760904956853
I assure you , Madam , he replied , that she does not need such advice .	25.551233311042935
Her answer , therefore , was not propitious , at least not to Elizabeth's wishes , for she was impatient to get home .	10.837508372512088
Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to Miss Darcy , without calling her attention .	7.245818907791295
They both set off , and the conjectures of the remaining three continued , though with little satisfaction , till the door was thrown open , and their visitor entered .	6.688316021086781
I mend pens remarkably well .	471.5869008114699
He does not want abilities .	471.6336941039698
and though prepared , as he told Elizabeth , to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house , he was used to be free from them there ;	6.118445004945616
My situation in life , my connections with the family of De Bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ;	8.290754678355867
In Meryton they parted ;	873.1264417762841
You do not know what he really is ;	150.27108844199108
and , before she could reply , he added , It is above eight months .	27.3962273899849
We are each of an unsocial , taciturn disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room , and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb .	4.366249659933784
and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother , when they were met by the butler , who said , If you are looking for my master , ma'am , he is walking towards the little copse .	4.327352195086582
whence , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods overspreading many , and occasionally part of the stream .	3.874167763670039
I know you will contrive it all .	183.1606683927052
Their manner of living , even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home , was unsettled in the extreme .	11.682939067212077
Oh , lord !	1719.2025306586143
but when the living fell , it was given elsewhere .	69.05412193563413
the morning in bustle and shopping , and the evening at one of the theatres .	26.00607761380032
The wedding took place ;	872.8811074345388
These are conditions , which , considering every thing , I had no hesitation in complying with , as far as I thought myself privileged , for you .	7.6579934147285496
No aunt , no officers , no news could be sought after ;	43.05413889493553
but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity .	26.081812120206433
cried Bingley .	4751.0788029920595
We want none of them ;	471.84157518954925
cried Elizabeth .	3961.228037884354
Sir William , how can you tell such a story ?	75.40211789784448
Yes ;	11559.025432404986
How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate !	15.434699491135673
She longed to speak , but could think of nothing to say ;	46.48437381214541
But the clothes , the wedding clothes !	183.34190474250624
Bennet and her daughters then departed , and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane , leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Darcy ;	6.57527024734278
Do not imagine , Miss Bennet , that your ambition will ever be gratified .	33.49096930471432
we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster's .	29.634925244752036
How humiliating is this discovery !	471.8086080262547
and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage ;	53.89492965329741
but I do not think there would have been any fun in it .	38.24129839826611
It is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us .	43.052034843341474
Not one party , or scheme , or any thing .	70.69339907306988
He replied , and was again silent .	182.92834490122445
So far each recital confirmed the other : but when she came to the will , the difference was great .	13.914108161804258
I dare say Bingley will be very glad to see you ;	61.132115164374156
Here you are in your own family .	183.4738460516449
Since her father's death , her home has been London , where a lady lives with her , and superintends her education .	11.541351665216494
Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire , paid his compliments , with his usual reserve , to Collins ;	10.010323266034483
Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter , Darcy must speak for himself .	25.279878323403423
You are a gentleman's daughter .	472.2019723359574
I do not recollect that we did .	183.22468028469797
As soon as they were gone , Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits ;	33.159726645812725
and have such tremblings , such flutterings , all over me , such spasms in my side , and pains in my head , and such beatings at heart , that I can get no rest by night nor by day .	4.350473945228477
Jane shook her head .	873.575015882092
Upon my word I say no more here than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood , except Netherfield .	13.31971656425473
You are quite a visit in my debt , Bingley , she added , for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us , as soon as you returned .	5.471981585780815
for , by the bye , you are to understand , that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them .	9.798721937640222
but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation .	8.46613468172857
Let me know every thing that I am to know , without delay .	35.387337795148255
Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him , but this step ( and let us rejoice over it ) marks nothing bad at heart .	9.086267556378813
Yes , replied Darcy , who could contain himself no longer , but that was only when I first knew her , for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance .	4.482379579875727
I ask only a comfortable home ;	282.33513186395595
I certainly shall not .	879.5114124896925
I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us .	53.745383730279244
When they get to our age I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do .	13.560130729518619
Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine , was in a different style ;	61.761112551332715
and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it .	29.675687519318608
Bennet was doubly engaged , on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane , who sat some way below her , and on the other , retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases ;	4.737389974940187
Charlotte had seen them from her husband's room , crossing the road , and immediately running into the other , told the girls what an honour they might expect , adding , I may thank you , Eliza , for this piece of civility .	3.9318486770201715
It has been coming on so gradually , that I hardly know when it began .	25.300767855880473
she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression .	53.72502064453166
yes the handsomest young lady that ever was seen ;	95.90316557901653
It is not that I do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman's of superior execution .	16.345363956201236
How much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow !	37.54141119028156
Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance , mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste .	16.81832256940658
My aunt Philips wants you so to get husbands , you can't think .	35.45447394605255
It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next , and a still greater , that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again , and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits , by all that affection could do .	3.028211266265163
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood , this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families , that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters .	3.395821367344952
Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified , never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting .	8.900522688190533
Next to being married , a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then .	16.80241529948447
Make haste , and come down this moment .	126.07739456675078
Now I have got some news for you , said Lydia , as they sat down to table .	18.984785460099943
what has she to do with it ?	183.41372786452467
Its windows opening to the ground , admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house , and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn .	5.364490653305439
That is to say , you had given your permission .	68.96764169056425
One may be continually abusive without saying any thing just ;	68.99262769125288
no it is not for me to be driven away by Darcy .	47.66114815997933
There was now employment for the whole party ;	126.30693218010933
The expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity .	21.716896916608633
I shall certainly try to get the better .	136.53080613959867
She read over her aunt's commendation of him again and again .	53.6992936169039
How is half such a sum to be repaid ?	91.3611654082918
and depend upon it , Bingley never stirs without him .	72.93629215733192
we are all in an uproar .	283.79608068693244
If , in the explanation of them which is due to myself , I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your's , I can only say that I am sorry .	5.0982516281651025
Wont it , Kitty ?	872.7545377705296
Oh !	8965.45062507954
This accounted to Elizabeth for Wickham's being among them .	91.36510300280366
I shall now know how to act .	183.1376054435776
I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of the covies for you .	10.588891117135908
Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister , that they did not once sit down to a family dinner .	9.955358349334569
But I shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity of your sister's countenance and air was such , as might have given the most acute observer , a conviction that , however amiable her temper , her heart was not likely to be easily touched .	3.636186153484202
Who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly !	16.54399016126602
He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place , and his intrigues , all honoured with the title of seduction , had been extended into every tradesman's family .	5.945268742714242
Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment ;	25.171792980599125
But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being withheld from seeing Jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless .	3.5804989447373714
CHAPTER VIII .	4353.740372381362
Long said so too , for I asked her whether you did not .	36.616905525906006
E8 .	15895.509420740158
That is very strange .	874.6465778639359
Oh !	8965.45062507954
It was a subject which they could not mention before me .	53.818482292896775
But when you have had time to think it all over , I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done .	11.311355203180675
and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits ;	12.934564669491683
That is a question which Darcy only can answer .	91.45800719404424
You were not by , when I told mamma , and the others , all about it .	19.578280550128184
When Darcy returned to the saloon , Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister .	8.879243514545033
But that is one great difference between us .	126.77933506089151
Her mother stepped forwards , embraced her , and welcomed her with rapture ;	35.313583171220635
The express was sent off directly .	299.14499733448434
Could he expect that her friends would not step forward ?	69.37951217382475
Darcy !	13597.716288560492
and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature , by the testimony so highly in his favour , and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light , which yesterday had produced .	5.190571621848804
It is impossible for me to be impartial .	143.36107644568372
Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love ;	35.407846005557005
But vanity , not love , has been my folly .	68.87953047542963
His understanding and opinions all please me ;	182.97831599814833
When the party broke up , Lydia returned with Forster to Meryton , from whence they were to set out early the next morning .	9.568929782052228
and she spoke very little , except in a low voice , to Jenkinson , in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable , and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said , and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes .	3.9266955393747844
but he soon afterwards said , I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month .	23.158119857084063
and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise , and owned she encouraged it as much as possible .	8.293801298545572
Yes , very different .	874.3364164695123
Jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening .	16.340727620394425
She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue , while in town , for the recovery of his daughter .	8.489783409182595
A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth ;	22.41759920709057
Jones says we must not think of moving her .	91.32606463305149
Why does she not come in ?	282.75774442003564
By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure ;	68.96970339318705
And that is quite impossible ;	471.6776795740263
An hour , however , saw the whole completed ;	91.60531034006961
Her sisters were uneasy for her , but her mother was delighted .	43.046570027904586
or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour .	16.82164476263414
You must decide for yourself , said Elizabeth , and if upon mature deliberation , you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife , I advise you by all means to refuse him .	3.953156225091662
and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions .	17.29515812776401
after going over so many , she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains .	19.576588253152863
Very few days passed in which Collins did not walk to Rosings , and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise ;	7.574996154386886
Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject ;	21.71546549754084
CHAPTER XV .	4138.577761074046
Never , even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield , or his dignified relations at Rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from self-consequence , or unbending reserve as now , when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed , would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings .	2.196633466918422
He has given in all his debts ;	183.28632897478988
CHAPTER VII .	4138.577761074046
Shall you like to have such a brother ?	126.07739456675088
Oh !	8965.45062507954
Your affectionate friend , LYDIA BENNET .	282.5551459248189
Did it , said he , did it soon make you think better of me ?	28.894609494510053
she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library .	68.91482029193998
However , he wrote some verses on her , and very pretty they were .	29.734170626871023
and at length , by repeated assurances that Darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the test of many months suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father's incredulity , and reconcile him to the match .	2.31998106744241
It is more than I engage for , I assure you .	55.97057174580204
He walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very great !	29.544908767016494
As soon as they entered the copse , Lady Catherine began in the following manner : You can be at no loss , Miss Bennet , to understand the reason of my journey hither .	6.096231840865611
To his tacit engagement with Miss De Bourgh ?	132.54500047477688
Elizabeth , having rather expected to affront him , was amazed at his gallantry ;	29.571371759729203
But at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went sorely against the grain ;	4.274743471259315
What a pity it is , mamma , we did not all go .	35.39050007085999
But Bennet , was not so well pleased with it .	68.87953047542963
Tell me once for all , are you engaged to him ?	53.89319422157084
What a good joke it will be !	183.55130796912513
Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her .	30.665181727060304
and as they entered the house , he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men ;	10.629178737612259
and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary .	25.166314030595927
He would scarcely be ten pounds a-year the loser , by the hundred that was to be paid them ;	15.010187683848466
If such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy !	18.998726334259842
Jane , who was not so light , nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth , soon lagged behind , while her sister , panting for breath , came up with him , and eagerly cried out , Oh , Papa , what news ?	4.027044384531518
said Elizabeth .	4797.661801655704
I shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on .	35.335903945849616
He had never had the slightest suspicion .	183.26159760768815
But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him , as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage ?	6.895158924111453
and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley , which might only grieve her sister farther .	7.956374169906898
He sat down for a few moments , and then getting up walked about the room .	23.67297335877275
Elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well ;	12.289505917423405
Her daughter , Miss de Bourgh , will have a very large fortune , and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates .	8.099739195756847
And we mean to treat you all , added Lydia ;	68.88603074550605
for he is now in the custody of his friend , and Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London !	7.739620032862654
Pursuing her way along the lane , she then began it .	55.92991835555153
She was disappointed , and angry with herself for being so .	55.9583169005336
She had been unwilling to mention Bingley ;	183.07554918467983
He is , indeed .	874.4385299985236
He was exactly what he had been , when I knew him in Hertfordshire ;	31.23078547190697
How can Bingley , who seems good humour itself , and is , I really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ?	7.965266368716411
She has a very good notion of fingering , though her taste is not equal to Anne's .	19.034310307738387
Haye-Park might do , said she , if the Gouldings would quit it , or the great house at Stoke , if the drawing-room were larger ;	9.219953347334084
We were born in the same parish , within the same park , the greatest part of our youth was passed together ;	11.544044685684627
CHAPTER II .	4138.577761074046
but with respect to any other leading characteristic , I do not imagine that much has been unfolded .	18.636370347321265
When you told Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes , you meant it to be a sort of panegyric , of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone , and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else ?	2.5207132770279235
for to her inexpressible vexation , she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Darcy , who sat opposite to them .	10.010152594550771
It is wonderful , replied Wickham , for almost all his actions may be traced to pride ;	20.181534579792515
At length , however , our kind friend procured the wished-for direction .	43.257390589974186
I think I have heard you say , that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton .	22.861959991496327
advice , which there was every reason to believe would be attended to ;	35.3051414270065
Elizabeth looked surprised .	1865.398780832112
I do not cough for my own amusement , replied Kitty fretfully .	43.09008130159443
To Rosings he then hastened to console Lady Catherine , and her daughter ;	38.44066487574341
I am astonished , said Miss Bingley , that my father should have left so small a collection of books .	14.687766723706114
I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly .	53.69720858441741
I was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off , and then I should have gone quite distracted .	10.994379603765427
they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money , great connections , and pride .	12.301438985067938
he continued after a pause , on seeing Bingley join the group ;	44.756258170334306
and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin .	29.661814357910206
Of this she was perfectly unaware ;	282.9197418596577
'Tis too much !	1852.072171128788
Not a syllable was uttered by either ;	184.149148290919
Your's , very sincerely , M GARDINER .	184.53541462431906
Collins had a compliment , and an allusion to throw in here , which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter .	10.333357383931714
I have not the pleasure of understanding you , said he , when she had finished her speech .	20.80474782497806
But these things happen so often !	282.34942266949554
The suspicions which had just arisen of Darcy and their niece , directed their observation towards each with an earnest , though guarded , enquiry ;	8.885772532969018
and quitting them both , he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton , denominated from that period Lucas Lodge , where he could think with pleasure of his own importance , and unshackled by business , occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world .	3.188324552379805
I have not the smallest objection to explaining them , said he , as soon as she allowed him to speak .	16.628818877264422
F3 , a full refund of any money paid for a work or a replacement copy , if a defect in the electronic work is discovered and reported to you within <TIME_PERIOD > of receipt of the work .	4.862114531412779
but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal , that her mother , though often disheartened , had never yet despaired of succeeding at last .	7.437817826413866
He was quite young , wonderfully handsome , extremely agreeable , and to crown the whole , he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party .	7.288669074435061
Such relief , however , as it was in her power to afford , by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences , she frequently sent them .	6.291848790690575
It was to be such a secret !	182.99269458266832
and if he is disposed to make them any amends , I shall not be the person to discourage him .	14.889602806186982
His wish of introducing his sister to her , was a compliment of the highest kind .	22.83283489287943
Again she read on .	872.7545377705296
Will you tell me how long you have loved him ?	69.4755555054248
After discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , Miss Lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight ;	2.3519898327258844
Yes , and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise .	47.58789511829277
I never heard that it was .	284.1414327492028
they are certainly not gone to Scotland .	184.6337926727697
for it gratified him , he said , to discover that Charlotte Lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter !	5.285415336395831
I did not expect such a compliment .	189.5828612076087
Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other , and the waiter was told that he need not stay .	18.11192957176503
She watched him whenever they were at Rosings , and whenever he came to Hunsford ;	26.495420057457974
Their party in the dining-room was large , for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news : and various were the subjects which occupied them ;	6.690011821389728
and if we were beyond the hour , we could not be married all day .	25.162362432702263
My dear Madam , replied he , let us be for ever silent on this point .	21.731403037842384
But when the gentlemen entered , Jane was no longer the first object .	35.38251734703239
Of what are you talking ?	503.3940685130034
We have heard only once .	473.57745813361504
With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn , and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart .	9.941842904081494
It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl , whom he was violently in love with only a few days before .	4.910520771755448
It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her .	29.596632686695663
Has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style ?	43.18546454091337
he merely answered her question , and read on .	91.40203351655094
If we make haste , said Lydia , as they walked along , perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes .	10.14597563547404
Elizabeth read on ;	1852.4837350275081
You will be a very happy woman .	183.2905990900889
the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers' wives , and Elizabeth continued her walk alone , crossing field after field at a quick pace , jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity , and finding herself at last within view of the house , with weary ancles , dirty stockings , and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise .	2.5828004532102256
But as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you .	29.65745832109559
Two obstacles of the five being thus removed , Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time , without making any impression on them .	6.934749269062016
but this would be nothing if you really liked him .	69.21024768026359
yes .	14480.258232335662
and really , upon serious consideration , I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter .	9.108886910037015
and her mother was too happy , to be quite so obstinate as usual .	29.580794802977987
though I am sure ( and I do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it , ) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole .	6.5566765340614195
and till the evening after the visit was paid , she had no knowledge of it .	23.558653309464887
It is no such thing .	471.8542217062196
Excellent Parsonage House !	1852.072171128788
I hope you have destroyed the letter .	183.2709417074034
She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings , and had sent for him only the Saturday before , to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening .	6.684109456214803
I am sure there is not on his .	126.29973185986037
I am sure we never read the same , or not with the same feelings .	25.172998640299625
Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast .	12.304661234785812
Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them .	44.88089245461526
She felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Wickham , and rejoiced in it .	18.36452964188859
Oh , no !	1856.8414363661354
And taking her hand , he would have given it to Darcy , who , though extremely surprised , was not unwilling to receive it , when she instantly drew back , and said with some discomposure to Sir William , Indeed , Sir , I have not the least intention of dancing .	3.404662478825943
She certainly did not hate him .	282.3506627855391
Had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it ;	35.33227365045814
The rapture of Lydia on this occasion , her adoration of Forster , the delight of Bennet , and the mortification of Kitty , are scarcely to be described .	7.202356231825124
I wonder my aunt did not tell us of that .	69.07433763864528
Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage , and when it drove off , Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house .	12.096500633457758
Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , Jane and Kitty followed , but Lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could ;	9.675529991447348
No one made any reply .	471.89195781544555
Bennet wondered at their coming , and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble , and was sure Jane would have caught cold again .	8.482451381751368
and the consciousness of this , was another reason for his resolving to follow us .	25.15757063939522
Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity ?	53.99071139049747
But with such a father and mother , and such low connections , I am afraid there is no chance of it .	12.094570723473463
she has got over the most trying age .	126.16204433383203
the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment ;	17.054151923518017
I think I have heard you say that you know them .	57.392178947903425
but his cousin , after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Collins , sat for some time without speaking to any body .	8.14346701178027
and on this account , as well as some others , found herself , when their visitors left them , capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction , though while it was passing , the enjoyment of it had been little .	4.1441951035889
If Elizabeth , when Darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of its contents .	6.163231844926472
Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours , he had yielded to his brother-in-law's intreaty that he would return to his family , and leave it to him to do , whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit .	3.928249130270174
You may , in fact , carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire , my dear cousin .	15.879432175979428
hopeless of seeing him before .	471.56144177488665
I will put on my things in a moment .	91.899281764704
Yours , c .	1714.7867885791668
You are a good girl ;	502.91450305238726
As soon as they entered , Bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information ;	7.352094293394271
but his perfect indifference , and your pointed dislike , make it so delightfully absurd !	25.177908170311376
Will you hear it ?	884.9754939482037
Society , I own , is necessary to me .	95.64525075053155
I hope not .	1857.4323033005107
Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had originated in jealousy , she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her , and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady's side , the acquaintance would now be renewed .	3.4205450658643866
Not the slightest .	1854.4663249295597
This was a lucky recollection it saved her from something like regret .	43.12928708920078
but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation .	126.08920579026261
How strange must it appear to him !	182.98574828639642
She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man , who , in disposition and talents , would most suit her .	10.98885163806582
I must beg to return to the house .	132.72300629388602
Why , indeed , he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head , as you will hear .	12.961833455290911
On his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him , which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said , Did not you think , Darcy , that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when I was teazing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton ?	2.4472837151074267
Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter .	29.54241929447434
The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat , drink , and sleep , and pursue the usual course of their employments .	9.780311739127542
They had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister .	43.12194464852301
She found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable .	29.54427158604398
I congratulate her .	1852.194383273414
In such cases , a woman has not often much beauty to think of .	29.54871303079518
After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity , Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday .	9.224844629989965
There , Bennet .	1853.2790066492494
It appears to me so very unlikely , that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless , and who was actually staying in his colonel's family , that I am strongly inclined to hope the best .	3.9192335188509677
for , besides the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her .	35.41312437381465
Yes , replied Wickham ;	874.3364164695123
I will have no reserves from you .	193.17890250495591
And now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be ;	17.296717431094496
My aunt , she continued , is going to-morrow into that part of the town , and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor-street .	9.595401675401774
You give me fresh life and vigour .	182.9326066763857
I say no more than the truth , and what every body will say that knows him , replied the other .	12.600219577042024
Her keenest attention was awakened ;	471.7562158696961
She really looked almost wild .	471.6152006322248
Miss De Bourgh was pale and sickly ;	183.0084339156673
Consoled by this resolution , she was the better able to bear her husband's incivility ;	25.14344703474128
There is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us .	25.16873195189784
He is his own master .	472.3885369818911
We live in so different a part of town , all our connections are so different , and , as you well know , we go out so little , that it is very improbable they should meet at all , unless he really comes to see her .	3.7326415595734455
I should like it beyond any thing !	183.2057627573941
You shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased .	18.997055294702715
Lady Catherine de Bourgh , she replied , has very lately given him a living .	30.079342182890038
My courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me .	71.94017813977332
I wish you had been there .	292.76501204581143
But to be guarded at such a time , is very difficult .	46.64599440612593
He is perfectly amiable .	874.4385299985236
Why , he has four or five thousand a-year , and very likely more .	31.77603388285816
Have you any other objection , said Elizabeth , than your belief of my indifference ?	29.1955284196349
told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her's , and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry .	6.817707506688753
Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth ;	73.76963771631965
He was resolutely silent however ;	472.116096815202
How can you be smiling so , Lizzy ?	126.69390323912133
who could have done less for her ?	183.55008779214998
The person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund .	10.330526262708958
Well , Lizzy , continued her mother soon afterwards , and so the Collinses live very comfortable , do they ?	13.536338780798957
These parties were acceptable to all ;	283.17255396333
Upon the whole , therefore , she found , what has been sometimes found before , that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire , did not in taking place , bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself .	4.216957694247257
she made a slight , formal , apology , for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was in every respect so altered a creature , that when she went away , I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer .	3.5367336982340696
Gardiner , highly amused by the kind of family prejudice , to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master , soon led again to the subject ;	7.495146067825119
If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield , said Bennet to her husband , and all the others equally well married , I shall have nothing to wish for .	5.807902197345677
It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case .	34.51421680416602
Had he done his duty in that respect , Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle , for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her .	6.23744932566798
and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton .	17.312217700019485
He had some intention , he added , of studying the law , and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein .	6.58342436809405
Lord !	14396.939037894257
I am not equal to it .	282.9697641415798
Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch-street , and repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and herself , which proved that the former had , from her heart , given up the acquaintance .	4.425743681109037
His reception however was of the most flattering kind .	91.35794937764702
Bennet's eyes sparkled .	1862.9833964638603
My aunt's intelligence had given me hope , and I was determined at once to know every thing .	17.29740706545489
I cannot think of it without abhorrence .	183.1376054435776
When she was discontented she fancied herself nervous .	126.61234898666112
Yours ever , CAROLINE BINGLEY .	471.56144177488665
I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time .	30.60846091945728
but it will have no effect on me .	126.30248949062232
and between her and Gardiner , with occasional help from Elizabeth , the conversation was carried on .	19.57705419302471
I must go instantly to my mother ;	183.2709417074034
He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while .	35.30827310136273
I cannot pretend to be sorry , said Wickham , after a short interruption , that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts ;	8.171448649262961
A man who had felt less , might .	126.83121079542077
B Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark .	192.92160119218158
and when at last Kitty did , she very innocently said , What is the matter mamma ?	19.591301943275237
If my vanity had taken a musical turn , you would have been invaluable , but as it is , I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers .	4.534708635202428
She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together ;	25.15378143670814
She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity , nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct .	16.808457973220964
I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country for my part , except the shops and public places .	11.235057060227657
but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough .	53.89735205524161
my dear , said Maria quite shocked at the mistake , it is not Lady Catherine .	25.508031269166413
When she was only fifteen , there was a gentleman at my brother Gardiner's in town , so much in love with her , that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away .	5.125941725057544
He had to be sure done much .	183.26159760768815
Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback , and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day .	9.305378117206075
But now suppose as much as you chuse ;	139.66879573843104
Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Darcy's progress through his book , as in reading her own ;	12.603384864723246
for Mary , on receiving amongst the thanks of the table , the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute began another .	5.285415336395832
The advice was followed readily , for the feverish symptoms increased , and her head ached acutely .	18.996610916885444
Letters of business too !	872.7545377705296
he was to come there with Wickham , you know .	68.92806977561507
Can you come to-morrow ?	875.3628094531122
And my aunt Philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good , added Kitty .	18.63745721008297
No , Lizzy , let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame .	16.820136087379243
I never heard of such a thing .	204.69792716303755
Are you , indeed ?	878.6958929468948
Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther , and when he ceased , the colour rose into her cheeks , and she said , In such cases as this , it is , I believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however unequally they may be returned .	3.177388032783142
What advantage can it be to you to offend Darcy ?	68.89798468115647
and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again , which I should think exceedingly probable , stay quietly at home , and be satisfied that we shall take no offence .	5.159702201571548
Miss Bingley saw all this likewise ;	282.90916211900867
Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me , because it would be imprudent ;	25.98720537438182
said Miss Bingley ;	1854.9554321945773
But his anger , I am persuaded , lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister's sentiments .	12.600503030184854
I knew enough of your disposition to be certain , that , had you been absolutely , irrevocably decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine , frankly and openly .	5.763257861505448
From such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink .	43.08260126892884
Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness .	68.92705956107727
This was exactly as it should be ;	183.45554733990528
Secondly , that I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness ;	32.561241829550426
It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he should .	43.052034843341474
They are young in the ways of the world , and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on , as well as the plain .	6.343201685711893
With the Gardiners , they were always on the most intimate terms .	44.94299180411922
She had a sister married to a Philips , who had been a clerk to their father , and succeeded him in the business , and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade .	5.201743948086671
Never , sir .	1862.9833964638603
Dear Lizzy !	4743.677376410631
How near it may be to mine , I cannot pretend to say .	36.62801577239836
for as the others were all going to sit down to cards , she could not be wanted to counteract her mother's schemes .	11.59463799329393
Elizabeth had received none since her return , that could come from Pemberley .	36.690470619529634
Jane was as much gratified by this , as her mother could be , though in a quieter way .	15.4592703183343
The officers of the shire were in general a very creditable , gentleman-like set , and the best of them were of the present party ;	9.086692606365766
It has been my own doing , and I ought to feel it .	35.5493763513085
Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face , and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections .	9.093588442314353
She explained what its effect on her had been , and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed .	13.890291963768158
CHAPTER XVIII .	4353.740372381362
No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth , and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful .	12.794238118392485
Your's , c .	1649.7163939346244
You must and shall be married by a special licence .	68.96279369980758
But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them .	29.557022913234356
nor , when we attempt to describe any particular scene , will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation .	15.036694982759816
In this manner Lady Catherine talked on , till they were at the door of the carriage , when turning hastily round , she added , I take no leave of you , Miss Bennet .	5.693133438437062
and Elizabeth , agitated and confused , rather knew that she was happy , than felt herself to be so ;	13.898061158321672
If I had ever learnt , I should have been a great proficient .	38.856699823391274
She is quite a little creature .	282.667329923674
Bingley does not know Wickham himself ?	282.54855123061964
I would not trust you so near it as East Bourne for fifty pounds !	29.59672043064903
He shall not be in love with me , if I can prevent it .	29.544908767016494
I did not expect it from you .	199.96557068411406
But in matters of greater weight , I may suffer from the want of money .	26.045427929733567
I came to you without a doubt of my reception .	71.92635734536417
Indeed I could not .	881.4079144943345
This is wholly unexpected .	875.5366098958821
and when they parted , after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield , and embracing her most tenderly , she even shook hands with the former .	4.505036898743441
My watchfulness has been effectual ;	471.7187122003186
c .	15895.509420740158
You may readily comprehend , she added , what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and ( comparatively speaking ) a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time .	4.217221993431121
That would be the greatest misfortune of all !	126.13513818685058
And so ended his affection , said Elizabeth impatiently .	91.5888848243565
Against staying longer , however , Elizabeth was positively resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked ;	15.009175861060113
Thank you but I always mend my own .	126.55438690341512
cried Elizabeth .	3961.228037884354
But the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me .	16.144409106949368
Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt's arrival .	44.915813611576816
Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more , and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly , there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity .	4.4156491198397605
and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of Lord , how tired I am !	12.315698828734872
She does not yet leave her dressing-room .	182.92227550805146
for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming .	43.048040326825806
Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Bingley .	53.79557938837238
but she found herself considerably useful to both of them , in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur .	13.53283867346309
If there were any one , that one could apply to , with a probability of gaining such a clue as that , it might be of essential consequence .	7.077096412276814
but , however , I hope it is not true .	75.21816011406192
I am sorry it went off .	283.3646125682347
Charles , when you build your house , I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley .	17.801538905901783
She had gained her point , and had time to consider of it .	35.32771105338258
said Elizabeth , still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam .	184.18277128727956
and in his behaviour to me , there were stronger impulses even than pride .	29.569224472783883
Darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said , This walk is not wide enough for our party .	19.00009560452027
She did not choose it , said her daughter , she would go .	36.76711475060276
dear , yes ;	1852.072171128788
I declare I do not know a more aweful object than Darcy , on particular occasions , and in particular places ;	13.668486512253423
he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton .	68.92806977561507
But why all this secrecy ?	471.61294093744067
for he would certainly think the better of me , if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat denial , and ride off as fast as I could .	6.246405527812415
but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement .	17.340828592414706
That is all settled .	881.3657583678469
As the day of his arrival drew near , I begin to be sorry that he comes at all , said Jane to her sister .	9.208036621172852
I wish I could see her .	285.7729870863149
We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance .	22.4171957497575
The colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ;	10.242863003741862
But now that my dear uncle is come , I hope every thing will be well .	21.761903693950007
But , Lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or Jane at most .	21.730475408097632
You had better neglect your relations , than run the risk of offending your patroness .	25.145827570544018
His pride never deserts him ;	471.7859605297104
Yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the t te- -t te was over .	9.303836481089231
but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty .	18.996496412417027
Every park has its beauty and its prospects ;	126.2444910835673
It is , in short , impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them , without actual blame on either side .	8.291548490768998
Oh !	8965.45062507954
She then sat still five minutes longer ;	183.3827919696056
When the dancing recommenced , however , and Darcy approached to claim her hand , Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence .	3.471027944058822
Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ;	31.330253352098318
every sister except Mary agreed to go with her ;	91.79318916313707
You see on what a footing we are .	126.09530015792555
There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds .	95.80776463954486
and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion .	12.607314323762331
she only smiles , I laugh .	282.5423181007908
Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman , not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Bennet .	13.936051460039328
Bennet indeed said little ;	873.3039280545929
Bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county ;	43.05881330223606
Wickham's affection for Lydia , was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it ;	29.620613063249884
Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings ;	91.32606463305149
It is really too distressing .	471.8542217062196
Jane recollected herself soon , and putting the letter away , tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation ;	11.232187869414936
but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures , every idea gave way to the charm of recollection ;	11.247325444077072
How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it !	11.368637770486803
It had better have happened to you , Lizzy ;	91.65823023130096
coming frequently before breakfast , and always remaining till after supper ;	53.69533281330631
Gardiner , who was walking arm in arm with Elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of her wonder .	15.73057463597582
Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once .	43.04926360399361
I hoped to find you reasonable ;	282.33513186395595
and I can never be in company with this Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections .	12.604355910631298
But not long was the interval of tranquillity ;	126.08821285810164
Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him ?	53.78966967057109
and the kindness of the late Darcy , though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his own words .	9.783684149489114
Not so hasty , if you please .	193.0942198853764
the latter of whom , however , could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her , in spite of all Miss Bingley's witticisms on fine eyes .	7.534473349307154
They went to the library , therefore , and asked their father , whether he would not wish them to make it known to her .	9.41506676221641
But consider your daughters .	872.8593830911467
and considering Collins's character , connections , and situation in life , I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair , as most people can boast on entering the marriage state .	5.394936041696241
Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts ?	127.13475089374803
said her aunt .	1854.9554321945773
said she , I heard you before ;	213.69228359834182
You begin to comprehend me , do you ?	126.09530015792555
As to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , I am not able to judge ;	8.858258319921777
and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way .	35.381299782174615
and her mother , with manners so far from right herself , was entirely insensible of the evil .	16.82060190150393
EDW .	15895.509420740158
and they pursued the accustomed circuit ;	283.28602913593846
that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side , and that if it were , it must belong to Darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance .	5.421487200236437
No really , replied Elizabeth ;	471.89195781544555
but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely , more I think than last year .	25.14501734128258
when I went away , I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again !	15.113191500799621
but , though she could not look , she could listen , and he told her of feelings , which , in proving of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable .	4.933360255847154
and , after standing a few moments without saying a word , he suddenly recollected himself , and took leave .	14.113466369607465
The picture gallery , and two or three of the principal bed-rooms , were all that remained to be shewn .	14.651119302888729
I will read you the passage which particularly hurts me .	68.94898494931847
I am sorry for her , because , with her disposition , she may not get over it immediately .	15.45849088444531
which , as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence , she accordingly read ;	12.599942440232278
that speech savours strongly of disappointment .	282.6967613717579
but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear .	126.78033343557111
Perhaps I do .	1855.8919078496158
but if he wished to converse with her , he might have better success .	30.70349557987103
It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man .	43.03951319020061
because we shall see the less of him .	126.07739456675078
No indeed ;	4748.249617890625
Royalty payments must be paid within <TIME_PERIOD > following each date on which you prepare ( or are legally required to prepare ) your periodic tax returns .	7.783580635910439
Poor little Lizzy !	1860.4034109326622
Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county , she was a most active magistrate in her own parish , the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by Collins ;	4.349929262244366
I hope , said she , as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day , you will give your mother-in-law a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her tongue ;	4.966150532876731
We had better not mention it .	282.47489418737564
Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as Bingley had now been gone a week , and nothing was heard of his return .	3.1160493490361967
he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune , or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn .	7.072594454594015
She felt anew the justice of Darcy's objections ;	126.56572260204952
and all for the sake of Collins too !	146.82520408940164
but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting .	29.63686860554233
but , however , he did not admire her at all : indeed , nobody can , you know ;	15.698168357440208
Much as I respect them , I believe , I thought only of you .	32.43511235049115
with barefaced questions , ingenious suppositions , and distant surmises ;	68.87435935390347
Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting , that had she chosen it , she might by this time have been presented to her , as her future niece ;	6.8302286088967765
Miss Darcy , the daughter of Darcy , of Pemberley , and Lady Anne , could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner .	9.316903888120454
She had turned away , but on hearing herself called , though in a voice which proved it to be Darcy , she moved again towards the gate .	7.481302076487014
She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known ;	29.54427158604398
If I have , I shall be the last person to confess it .	38.03627260676853
She was on the point of continuing her walk , when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park ;	8.277690285446699
To the girls , who could not listen to their cousin , and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument , and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle-piece , the interval of waiting appeared very long .	4.0956566180991505
In talking over their route the evening before , Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again .	17.59255270793392
To yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you .	25.152093510677553
It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire , nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay ;	7.339059997342619
and she would , at times , have given any thing to be privileged to tell him , that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family .	6.125870044577439
Not one .	4750.576546947546
said Jane as she finished it .	282.65072884648254
With assumed tranquillity he then replied , I have no wish of denying that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that I rejoice in my success .	5.38644094193417
Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring ?	53.76528896333978
But pride where there is a real superiority of mind , pride will be always under good regulation .	16.80325631148604
thoughtless , thoughtless Lydia !	872.7545377705296
I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness ;	30.5079480242075
With a triumphant smile , they were told , that it was ten miles round .	27.845024222325826
but the gentlemen will have Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton ;	53.79381951737323
You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion , which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty .	6.691509491931761
The necessity must be obeyed and farther apology would be absurd .	53.69991330566006
One of them does .	875.1536282906261
the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy .	91.41892912830274
Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity , and by the middle of June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears ;	7.438443922460291
Now is your time .	876.2870918876641
it was impossible to think of any thing else , and totally indisposed for employment , she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise .	7.890586268503764
They were not the only objects of Collins's admiration .	91.43932345670706
but her own opinion continued the same , and she left him disappointed and sorry .	26.083709503869095
but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal .	13.597435293124894
With a strong prejudice against every thing he might say , she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield .	12.820824581580647
Bingley met them with hopes that Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected .	21.725003967443975
To congratulate myself on the hope of relations , whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ?	15.013511354227278
I write rather slowly .	872.8063687780879
The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge , and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed .	5.215622142602009
This information , however , startled Bennet ;	182.99484817284574
Care of him !	1852.072171128788
It was drawn at the same time as the other about eight years ago .	33.46116066575613
There is , I believe , in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil , a natural defect , which not even the best education can overcome .	7.729024521926467
If !	15904.620633851087
They have a sharp , shrewish look , which I do not like at all ;	26.86355819565694
as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general , was beyond the Collinses' reach .	21.791135352191375
My brother admires her greatly already , he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing , her relations all wish the connection as much as his own , and a sister's partiality is not misleading me , I think , when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman's heart .	3.081354552826338
But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend ;	17.64258050051565
Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile , she said , I did not know before that you ever walked this way .	11.10296034822891
My manners must have been in fault , but not intentionally I assure you .	30.685625850702387
I want to be told whether I ought , or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand Wickham's character .	12.280862086718694
and fearful of its being Darcy , she was directly retreating .	53.697061873635356
Oh !	8965.45062507954
What a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt !	44.83940582221284
No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard .	68.90754398388195
Her mother's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determined not to venture near her , lest she might hear too much .	7.78465213374549
I certainly have not the talent which some people possess , said Darcy , of conversing easily with those I have never seen before .	10.170731781372968
A most welcome negative followed the last question and her alarms being now removed , she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself ;	7.054917361352223
I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship .	55.06497733923526
though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon regained her composure , and calmly replied , Why should you be surprised , my dear Eliza ?	6.898134360411873
While she spoke , an involuntary glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes .	5.688539840581328
Do clear them too , or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody .	26.50757845406444
I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children .	91.83923481125079
After making every possible enquiry on that side London , Colonel F came on into Hertfordshire , anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes , and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield , but without any success , no such people had been seen to pass through .	3.6111132562074704
She was no sooner in possession of it , than hurrying into the little copse , where she was least likely to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the benches , and prepared to be happy ;	4.645088324104208
not equal to Lydia's for him .	282.32115989634974
She finds Miss Pope a treasure .	282.3506627855391
but the things should be ordered immediately .	183.34345960376334
I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn ;	53.74762627701969
The rest of the evening brought her little amusement .	93.83743897571426
and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy .	7.78701265429786
I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject , but I will not leave the country without confiding them , and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable .	5.145490051663859
Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings , Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy , calling for every one's congratulations , and laughing and talking with more violence than ever ;	6.234989219486308
She was perfectly sensible that he never had ;	132.55834309632945
till , shaking off his embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the gentlest of accents , You , who so well know my feelings towards Darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right .	3.0940786399435263
But the morrow passed off much better than she expected ;	69.00811473622989
He spoke well , but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed , and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride .	6.910936579337133
and , according to the present plan , were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire .	21.725544545141126
I believed you to be wishing , expecting my addresses .	68.87691576261868
His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen , on his returning to Netherfield .	9.558135245833626
but it must be done .	472.63322705440595
I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object .	38.165470296779226
But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man , whom they had never seen before , of most gentleman-like appearance , walking with an officer on the other side of the way .	5.204030783962235
He is the best landlord , and the best master , said she , that ever lived .	22.682113283476927
Though it is difficult , said Jane , to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due , the wish is certainly to his credit .	5.919743603802081
I am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose Darcy's regard .	22.478285282065293
Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door , and the carriage stopped at the small gate , which led by a short gravel walk to the house , amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party .	5.336015499749815
We neither of us perform to strangers .	182.99656710860864
He observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ;	4.774652486670498
The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Bennet the next morning , but the post came in without bringing a single line from him .	8.408603441609543
Nothing that she could say , however , had any influence .	58.33864047362515
It is amazing to me , said Bingley , how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished , as they all are .	9.293767758365314
cried he .	4796.745751882438
If he means to be but little at Netherfield , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we might possibly get a settled family there .	5.441094217319275
Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself , but his manners were always so pleasing , that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought , his smiles and his easy address , while he claimed their relationship , would have delighted them all .	3.469868822182702
But my dear Lydia , I don't at all like your going such a way off .	22.908196586046312
E4 .	15895.509420740158
Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves .	9.589309228624536
and a fortnight only was wanting of it , when a letter arrived from Gardiner , which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent .	8.299199709401426
and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening , and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours , Miss Elizabeth , for the two first dances especially , a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her .	2.5659141625937423
And there was my aunt , all the time I was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon .	9.109522704156646
It will save me a world of trouble and economy .	69.07864446430301
And what do you think she said besides ?	139.5247680158333
Jane went to him instantly , kissed him , and thanked him for his goodness .	25.15470016933647
and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter , she found little , except the professed affection of the writer , that could give her any comfort .	7.432524477026283
She is on her road somewhere , I dare say , and so passing through Meryton , thought she might as well call on you .	9.680769190612695
After a slight preparation for good news , the letter was read aloud .	35.42380779746375
Oh , yes .	1869.786862956989
From the very beginning , from the first moment I may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form that ground-work of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike ;	2.5989514842737256
My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers .	57.29229244395851
Jane will be quite an old maid soon , I declare .	53.72502064453166
Nothing , on the contrary , could be more natural ;	80.88088121772687
Yes ;	11559.025432404986
Elizabeth was shocked to think that , however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself , the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal !	5.531993365881241
It had come with a fare from London ;	126.56877369253607
Then , the two third he danced with Miss King , and the two fourth with Maria Lucas , and the two fifth with Jane again , and the two sixth with Lizzy , and the Boulanger If he had had any compassion for me , cried her husband impatiently , he would not have danced half so much !	3.0578498956378937
When breakfast was over , they were joined by the sisters ;	59.68619729635123
She did indeed , Louisa .	474.9077141045683
Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London ;	19.06651008817177
No said Darcy , I have made no such pretension .	71.95834159383179
CHAPTER IV .	4138.577761074046
For , though your accusations were ill-founded , formed on mistaken premises , my behaviour to you at the time , had merited the severest reproof .	8.861393102256544
lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table , after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter ;	15.009175861060113
It was Collins's picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened ;	68.90130120684307
But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities , replied her uncle .	25.236685356024743
Do you not consider that a connection with you , must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody ?	17.61755114961104
My dear Bennet , cried his wife , what are you talking of ?	40.59797744049121
Lydia was a stout , well-grown girl of fifteen , with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance ;	19.079794174524313
It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire .	69.03238503649197
To be sure London was rather thin , but however the little Theatre was open .	25.319196236079996
She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded ;	14.151149352611169
My mother was in hysterics , and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power , I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done !	6.458842166550248
Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room , and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from Bingley by a housemaid , and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters .	3.2551857269433713
His revenge would have been complete indeed .	182.97831599814833
I could hardly keep my countenance .	284.1414327492028
Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes .	17.590895700295615
She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent , without remembering that his cousin was to go with him ;	15.05700286264948
Elizabeth's misery increased , at such unnecessary , such officious attention !	53.809584772936
He resigned all claim to assistance in the church , were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it , and accepted in return three thousand pounds .	6.162854613799289
As for myself , it is many , many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner .	10.348911500347855
That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary ;	16.8069039300117
when she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage , the difference , the change was so great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible .	2.8809697547232376
That is all settled ;	881.3657583678469
till the latter walked away from her , and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano-forte , stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's countenance .	5.950085145352052
You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters ;	28.231376370650274
And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself ?	57.289067717794644
I do not blame Jane , she continued , for Jane would have got Bingley , if she could .	16.592770851708796
To donate , please visit : <URL> Section 5 .	91.37003569617771
I am astonished , my dear , said Bennet , that you should be so ready to think your own children silly .	14.176466466272721
The effect was immediate .	872.8811074345388
Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth ;	44.87093865080777
Not that I think Charlotte so very plain but then she is our particular friend .	25.307631913041696
Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine , and his kind intention of christening , marrying , and burying his parishioners whenever it were required .	7.395681032632161
You are quite right .	874.0586526558463
but now , as Bingley's friend and your husband , there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me .	12.60055448149284
Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ;	11.5174752918969
I wish you had been there , my dear , to have given him one of your set downs .	17.182222845515554
but you must own she is very plain .	127.34783700476696
but attended with all that embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior , the belief of her being proud and reserved .	4.829938989083679
In revolving lady Catherine's expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference .	9.711145795880636
With a book he was regardless of time ;	126.65285159112891
Their sister's wedding day arrived ;	472.0964291441105
Wickham began to speak on more general topics , Meryton , the neighbourhood , the society , appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen , and speaking of the latter especially , with gentle but very intelligible gallantry .	4.351972376245831
Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters .	25.2471910067875
This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be ;	21.75409175299617
and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better .	43.186777911335426
though I doubt whether his reserve , or anybody's reserve , can be answerable for the event .	19.052981637396126
In a few days more , we may gain some news of them , and till we know that they are not married , and have no design of marrying , do not let us give the matter over as lost .	4.556580831825372
and I wish with all my heart it may prove so ;	57.31180151937268
The younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done ;	15.010046494723772
And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Forster , the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me .	8.969949427885439
She answered him with cold civility .	284.15706303326067
If , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise , should come to his friend within a few days , she added , I shall know how to understand it .	6.640315889066031
But I will not repine .	475.2804535109118
Bingley will not be detained in London by them .	91.38490565965999
We were always encouraged to read , and had all the masters that were necessary .	25.243093188708162
so far we are equal .	472.84243660369384
I was angry perhaps at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper direction .	19.59007418023102
yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet .	26.052709555644945
She burst into tears as she alluded to it , and for a few minutes could not speak another word .	15.453387021862152

and the evening , though as it passed it seemed long , was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion ;	8.888737637814645
for Bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken , and Lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , boisterously exclaimed , Good Lord !	6.5611005423500295
Is not it so , Bennet ?	282.84237656843413
and I never saw such happy manners !	193.06197782866406
You will only think I feel more than I ought to do , when I tell you all .	17.314522528685206
We may as well wait , perhaps , till the circumstance occurs , before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon .	11.231039060918103
Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion ( unasked too ) on this subject ;	21.71546549754084
Your examination of Darcy is over , I presume , said Miss Bingley ;	37.99728447006083
He spoke of apprehension and anxiety , but his countenance expressed real security .	35.30827310136273
it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome .	126.35998697856141
You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane .	68.9924241777142
As her successor in that house , she regarded her with jealous abhorrence .	35.31856060239264
But what does he say of the living ?	132.4880267165705
E8 or 1 .	1714.7867885791668
Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice , which on every other subject shall be my constant guide , though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself .	3.5128062975091283
that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place , and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Morris immediately ;	7.778563722398127
1 .	10898.860396037358
They were more disturbed , more unequal , than she had often seen them .	31.692226613563122
and Darcy had much better finish his letter .	126.08232441121416
It is natural that obligation should be felt , and if I could feel gratitude , I would now thank you .	12.793821279546265
They are going to be encamped near Brighton ;	126.37661435504874
If you have not been mistaken here , I must have been in an error .	27.41109548549797
1 .	10898.860396037358
The rain continued the whole evening without intermission ;	126.09045440218053
You have employed your time much better .	183.20865933704724
She saw all the glories of the camp ;	126.45301678883723
My dear , you flatter me .	283.9493510365297
PRIDE AND PREJUDICE : A Novel .	282.32115989634974
Nobody wants him to come .	471.56144177488665
but she had her share of business as well as her aunt , and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in Lambton , with false excuses for their sudden departure .	4.965515978201528
The church ought to have been my profession I was brought up for the church , and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living , had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now .	4.155519503735576
Let me take it in the best light , in the light in which it may be understood .	16.833376907562013
Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet , and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body , went away .	7.061973572061591
E8 or 1 .	1714.7867885791668
thought she .	4743.677376410631
and as that left too short a period for them to go so far , and see so much as they had proposed , or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on , they were obliged to give up the Lakes , and substitute a more contracted tour ;	3.035355125115673
she cried .	4102.7129695329595
Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry , but could only force one most reluctant smile .	18.9970648698514
Yes ;	11559.025432404986
I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind .	23.59373200217644
said she .	4174.740194871325
The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence , or frightened by his high and imposing manners , and sees him only as he chuses to be seen .	7.061122419122562
I advise Darcy , and Lizzy , and Kitty , said Bennet , to walk to Oakham Mount this morning .	14.926783948714833
and immediately , though not very fluently , gave him to understand , that her sentiments had undergone so material a change , since the period to which he alluded , as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure , his present assurances .	4.128453550819297
To the rest of the family they paid little attention ;	80.04617798907212
That they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice !	9.29364276216548
For my part , I am inclined to believe it all Darcy's , but you shall do as you chuse .	14.275069600749319
She was met in the vestibule by Lydia , who , flying to her , cried in a half whisper , I am glad you are come , for there is such fun here !	5.843842952577699
But enough of this .	872.8593830911467
Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's interruption , and promised that it should not occur again , if he would resume his book ;	8.320564818860568
She was still very poorly , and Elizabeth would not quit her at all , till late in the evening , when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep , and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself .	3.834435716713233
This he considered sufficient encouragement , and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her , immediately followed .	10.332293441239782
She was a little revived , however , by his bringing back his coffee cup himself ;	22.836357181292296
Except , thought Elizabeth , when she goes to Ramsgate .	75.10802145779748
Can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand ?	29.58653087898465
Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday ;	29.551716160903293
But now she would no longer conceal from her , his share in Lydia's marriage .	25.19977920727095
yes it would be much better to wait till Jane was well , and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again .	8.309540416042914
It was too early in the morning for visitors , and besides , the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours .	9.088101865829891
and however bare of news the country in general might be , they always contrived to learn some from their aunt .	12.280840960364653
and their mother talked on , of her dislike of Darcy , and her resolution to be civil to him only as Bingley's friend , without being heard by either of them .	6.073462027924853
for on entering that place they removed into a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom .	15.012272458091605
The loo table , however , did not appear .	95.65449771451603
which brought them again , after some time , in a descent among hanging woods , to the edge of the water , in one of its narrowest parts .	7.202057828554445
and the other , how I am ever to pay him .	53.73259397086094
but when the servants were withdrawn , he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest , and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine , by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness .	4.162312283640425
You know , sister , we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it .	21.749719220878642
He readily agreed to it .	471.6336941039698
I am afraid you will not be able to make it out , but I hardly know what I have written .	13.963542129686225
She will be married at sixteen !	285.11520008684903
and she was , in fact , almost engrossed by her nephews , speaking to them , especially to Darcy , much more than to any other person in the room .	6.3730123754993
But you will know it , when I have told you what happened the very next day .	19.026272876764086
Lady Catherine , Sir William , and and Collins sat down to quadrille ;	36.66069979672424
Another day I will do the same ;	182.9046321206164
Be assured , my dear Sir , that Collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you , and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the bitterest kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove .	3.929643563268301
It is from my cousin , Collins , who , when I am dead , may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases .	8.083863112163789
Oh !	8965.45062507954
I am by no means of opinion , I assure you , said he , that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ;	5.511198654222004
Adieu to disappointment and spleen .	471.56144177488665
Let her go then .	874.2161235676816
He concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which , in spite of all his endeavours , he had found impossible to conquer ;	9.166071899749857
The sanguine hope of good , however , which the benevolence of her heart suggested , had not yet deserted her ;	12.600619181221507
but unable to waste such a precious occasion , she suddenly got up , and saying to Kitty , Come here , my love , I want to speak to you , took her out of the room .	5.008701198006458
Now and then , they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship , and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits .	7.7334100952780505
I am perfectly ready , I assure you , to keep my engagement ;	41.03947813503016
and Bingley's large fortune , the mention of which gave animation to their mother , was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign .	7.478751190705145
If , as I conclude will be the case , you send me full powers to act in your name , throughout the whole of this business , I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement .	4.492111259240389
If you mention my name at the Bell , you will be attended to .	31.244329725414556
and Collins having been in waiting near the lodges , to make them his parting obeisance , was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence , of their appearing in very good health , and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected , after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings .	3.1669380950109196
Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all , and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet , with great pleasure .	6.363639764288453
and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing her into Derbyshire , had been the means of uniting them .	7.487641716414045
I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies ( if such young ladies there are ) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time .	4.850416786667246
Vanity and pride are different things , though the words are often used synonimously .	29.54241929447434
CHAPTER VI .	4138.577761074046
and I think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all , and very hypocritical .	15.436978899492798
I only hope they may have half my good luck .	68.87691576261861
For though elated by his rank , it did not render him supercilious ;	37.44324157570224
You and the girls may go , or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better , for as you are as handsome as any of them , Bingley might like you the best of the party .	4.219361757104539
Her prudent mother , occupied by the same ideas , forbore to invite him to sit by herself .	17.5927595323246
He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship , replied Elizabeth with emphasis , and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life .	7.201786616422231
stay where you are .	872.7545377705296
Pray , my dear aunt , what is the difference in matrimonial affairs , between the mercenary and the prudent motive ?	13.42805349041236
and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long , that even Bingley's good humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone .	4.9609370642572905
But now it comes out .	473.580452384755
she comes here to-morrow with him .	282.5423181007908
Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us .	126.11830890827804
cried Elizabeth when she had finished it .	199.68245802812075
In understanding Darcy was the superior .	282.4214101556047
Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend , that had attended her from that part of the world .	10.272798892092782
the ladies drove on , and the others returned into the house .	44.76315237065003
My dear aunt , this is being serious indeed .	91.42438707916556
but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him .	35.307578478466574
Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding ;	53.69533281330635
Elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to confirm his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself ;	5.306894739116376
When Denny , and Wickham , and Pratt , and two or three more of the men came in , they did not know him in the least .	7.791330441836523

her features , though not plain , were insignificant ;	91.64850618103364
their father was in neither ;	471.56144177488665
But against this , there were objections ;	182.92153389378294
Darcy was almost as far from her , as the table could divide them .	30.673874696046624
But she is very young ;	473.3479827468554
but was too angry with Lydia , to send any message to her .	35.307578478466574
but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody ;	12.629769314681978
Bingley was by no means deficient , but Darcy was clever .	59.824635216032185
The introduction , however , was immediately made ;	139.21514847981356
You must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention ;	29.572761259424716
Nothing could console and nothing appease her .	183.2378416279336
Bingley .	15917.46338924224
At present I will say nothing about it .	133.89994704896546
but what could set you off in the first place ?	68.8800050922285
but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane ;	14.726194748116194
The loss of her daughter made Bennet very dull for several days .	43.03917530227505
and , while examining the nearer aspect of the house , all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned .	16.130960965205265
several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle , a private had been flogged , and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married .	6.473029683308477
and to her it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first , and was in a way to be very much in love ;	5.465947816080361
There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name .	19.01285369757324
In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ;	6.742360934209602
she cried : This is delightful indeed !	183.9193861323256
In town I believe he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence , and being now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and dissipation .	5.215979645341161
said she , as she looked in her face .	100.68106283996283
This fine account of him , whispered her aunt , as they walked , is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend .	9.088146717918388
Young women should always be properly guarded and attended , according to their situation in life .	21.71546549754084
not deficient in good humour when they were pleased , nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it ;	12.927597450728868
Complied with !	4743.677376410631
Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey , and as she did not answer them all herself , attention was necessary , which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her ;	5.589817616880952
but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters .	68.8800050922285
are quite well .	1852.072171128788
Oh !	8965.45062507954
I grieve to find , however , that Colonel F is not disposed to depend upon their marriage ;	18.323617209160634
and if I had my will , we should .	96.23573340897039
Why will you think so ?	472.357018861332
and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on the renewal of his addresses .	3.3318009339332795
I might as well enquire , replied she , why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ?	4.039529622012734
I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here .	7.3293313584687185
who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister , and gratified my vanity , in useless or blameable distrust .	12.301438985067938
Jane heard them with horror .	471.9644388865048
My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family , and if my manner has been at all reprehensible , I here beg leave to apologise .	4.716671687197505
She enquired into Charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly and minutely , and gave her a great deal of advice , as to the management of them all ;	9.16594834905897
I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party .	15.066806737149532
Attention , forbearance , patience with Darcy , was injury to Wickham .	43.035708093730584
and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must produce , found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business .	11.517309146440605
so genteel and so easy !	472.84243660369384
Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to the piano-forte , and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way , which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived , she seated herself .	5.5901329279315295
Oh !	8965.45062507954
Though Lydia's short letter to F gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green , something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W never intended to go there , or to marry Lydia at all , which was repeated to Colonel F who instantly taking the alarm , set off from B intending to trace their route .	2.735812737598053
She stared , coloured , doubted , and was silent .	71.92932476282827
and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person ( Lady Lucas ) freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Bingley .	4.358424640253148
I , who have valued myself on my abilities !	91.3296803691227
I wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind .	25.19905036558688
He was seriously concerned , that a cause of so little advantage to any one , should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law , and he was determined , if possible , to find out the extent of his assistance , and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could .	3.4299105211714624
She will make him a very proper wife .	126.45301678883723
But depend upon it , Collins , she added , that Lizzy shall be brought to reason .	23.044071156050567
He comes down on Thursday at the latest , very likely on Wednesday .	35.30827310136273
Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is .	29.549129893670315
What do you think has happened this morning ?	127.01881097368599
She was gone directly .	873.5080149613874
Elizabeth was forced to go .	502.7913765580462
and when your sister is recovered , you shall if you please name the very day of the ball .	16.322272866694117
and Darcy , after looking at her for a moment , turned silently away .	31.211454467026766
He was full of joy and attention .	183.0866522573219
He looked serious as usual ;	471.6336941039698
nay , which has already arisen from it , I am sure you would judge differently in the affair .	17.649953274842854
Lydia laughed , and said , Aye , that is just like your formality and discretion .	23.585298478708886
Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister ;	21.791135352191375
In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man !	36.62511703456307
When all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at Pemberley ;	13.52755884011767
Yes ;	11559.025432404986
As soon as Jane had read Gardiner's hope of Lydia's being soon married , her joy burst forth , and every following sentence added to its exuberance .	7.810268230864518
Jane's temper was not desponding , and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart .	5.1067762917946355
We may as well leave them by themselves you know ;	68.90248591264427
Elizabeth replied that it was .	471.6471768839811
The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning ;	126.65486988347574
any thing was a welcome relief to him at Rosings ;	68.87435935390347
Much more rational , my dear Caroline , I dare say , but it would not be near so much like a ball .	12.068750124177635
What do you mean ?	881.8917100523443
However , I did not hear above one word in ten , for I was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear Wickham .	9.453427220255385
A carat character is used to denote superscription .	126.13980579834178
He has not an ill-natured look .	282.9594779820129
What could your ladyship propose by it ?	183.8640882951814
In Three Volumes .	1640.0232948883847
with tears and lamentations of regret , invectives against the villanous conduct of Wickham , and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage ;	9.912915716990625
They insist also on my seeing Jones therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me and excepting a sore-throat and head-ache there is not much the matter with me .	5.014723666603117
But such as they were , it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them , and what a contrariety of emotion they excited .	8.299369281784587
Jane had not been gone long before it rained hard .	69.24522980013782
but I am sure I never saw any thing of it .	69.996924501664
Reynolds's respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master .	25.14344703474128
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ?	91.79318916313707
They saw much to interest , but nothing to justify enquiry .	55.94092751351001
cried Miss Bingley .	1854.640602994784
but she did weep from vexation and envy .	126.22658210379167
Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight .	126.13407837271967

Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister .	43.09231672642542
and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle , so I was determined he should know it , and so I let down the side glass next to him , and took off my glove , and let my hand just rest upon the window frame , so that he might see the ring , and then I bowed and smiled like any thing .	2.7149565102183746
I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression .	75.23739912770716
Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish , self reproach , she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness .	12.280591974049722
but as he took up his abode with the Lucases , his arrival was no great inconvenience to Bennet .	15.460245036678907
Lady Catherine then observed , Your father's estate is entailed on Collins , I think .	25.17065337084688
Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort ;	9.30758051206985
Collins has made an offer to Lizzy , and she will not have him .	32.326423998568
I think there cannot be too little said on the subject .	53.96812479394844
and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Darcy's looks and behaviour .	8.59316506822285
and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her .	22.453510640147204
I thank you for explaining it so fully .	127.46871520482827
She cared for none of her friends , she wanted no help of his , she would not hear of leaving Wickham .	12.271008288193995
Thank Heaven !	4378.812588156309
YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION , THE TRADEMARK OWNER , AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL , DIRECT , INDIRECT , CONSEQUENTIAL , PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE .	3.677529592112193
but he will vouch for the good conduct , the probity and honour of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that Wickham has deserved much less attention from Darcy than he has received ;	5.590663398298394

That is not very likely ;	472.4907099354028
At present I will not say more , but perhaps when we are better acquainted He was interrupted by a summons to dinner ;	10.38343934429719
But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill .	46.57764560011686
one , that Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief ;	43.21906651055367
Elizabeth , after slightly surveying it , went to a window to enjoy its prospect .	25.16691442948727
What can be the meaning of this !	188.77892314892838
What is Darcy to me , pray , that I should be afraid of him ?	27.47174480632587
I assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town .	17.870046285198768
Obstinate , headstrong girl !	872.7545377705296
for certainly , there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction .	36.62684606736053
It now first struck her , that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage , and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings , in the absence of more eligible visitors .	4.300644949477863
Certainly not ;	4775.128987276426
You could not make me happy , and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who would make you so .	10.03354039995949
Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice .	182.96855453179248
The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information , was as sincere as her brother's in sending it .	13.524978223492045
I thank you for my share of the favour , said Elizabeth ;	43.58956842428329
I have nothing either to hope or fear , and nothing to reproach him with .	25.152455354563145
At present I am not in love with Wickham ;	96.60398568972307
It is only that he has better means of having it than many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor .	9.088268950269292
and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked Darcy before they had known any thing of the matter .	10.777031639736368
but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them .	25.255145145220805
I have by no means done .	282.4981947602293
That is not an unnatural surmise , said Fitzwilliam , but it is lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly .	12.200251576094857
all that his library afforded .	471.56144177488665
The commendation bestowed on him by Reynolds was of no trifling nature .	43.03917530227505
You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them .	39.431045387303136
But let me advise you to think better of it .	68.87953047542963
You excel so much in the dance , Miss Eliza , that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you ;	11.732051245927174
MY DEAR BROTHER , At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece , and such as , upon the whole , I hope will give you satisfaction .	6.162581299926441
Thank you , said Lydia , for if you did , I should certainly tell you all , and then Wickham would be angry .	9.930399879781731
In Three Volumes .	1640.0232948883847
I know no harm of her .	282.74932142875343
Then , who taught you ?	475.12041587006513
I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary .	92.24870430790698
and though he belonged to one of the universities , he had merely kept the necessary terms , without forming at it any useful acquaintance .	9.090532508110007
He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily postponed seeing him , till after the departure of the former .	5.547472840326259
Such a charming man !	880.4637098930298
His pride , said Miss Lucas , does not offend me so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it .	9.293290658823684
thought Elizabeth .	4743.677376410631
In a few minutes , Bennet half opened the door and called out , Lizzy , my dear , I want to speak with you .	10.384375253464173
But Lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me .	35.30737360558008
You may depend upon my seeking no further .	132.69238978502494
but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Philips , and was , by her watchfulness , most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin .	8.306520518497342
As yet , she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its reasonableness .	13.527980183477847
I should as soon call her mother a wit .	91.4563601383951
We will be down as soon as we can , said Jane ;	43.201140504613804
This must be the grossest falsehood !	282.4720197126427
Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before , how many years longer Bennet was likely to live ;	8.321590726749385
Collins then returned to Elizabeth .	471.9644388865048
Yes ;	11559.025432404986
Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene , and could observe the three ladies before her composedly .	16.80381537735999
and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Collins , was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house , as soon as Bennet were dead .	5.060973333605565
And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother ?	91.34257250110858
Miss Eliza Bennet , said Miss Bingley , despises cards .	82.26450602592024
that as to fortune , it is a most eligible match ;	58.31219789975602
and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister's , Wickham is by no means a respectable young man .	9.709652884132565
Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour , till Sir William thus began .	3.635896964641282
What could be more natural than his asking you again ?	72.23008338456923
Certain it is , that the living became vacant two years ago , exactly as I was of an age to hold it , and that it was given to another man ;	6.3433472190920845
I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh , and of her mother Lady Catherine .	5.884841330222061
Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition .	126.38891778371976
I shall send this by express , that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer .	16.814004636841837
He is certainly a good brother , said Elizabeth , as she walked towards one of the windows .	20.22548008996626
If you'll believe me , I did not once put my foot out of doors , though I was there a fortnight .	12.272216718220736
And it is the more to be lamented , because there is reason to suppose , as my dear Charlotte informs me , that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter , has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence , though , at the same time , for the consolation of yourself and Bennet , I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an enormity , at so early an age .	2.27363670161027
and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn , and of her stay in Derbyshire , so often , and in so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts .	4.561807934785259
but at the same time , there was no one , whose knowledge of a sister's frailty would have mortified her so much .	11.672614772300372
My father and mother believe the worst , but I cannot think so ill of him .	23.174230585844377
Wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we have thought him ;	35.336247443949475
Ten thousand pounds !	1852.072171128788
I do assure you , Sir , that I have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man .	9.552008967956475
But as to your other objection , I am afraid it will hardly hold good .	27.863559661472365
Yet now I must believe you , cried Jane .	91.57233244155437
and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself .	19.008460417816135
She has no money , no connections , nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for ever .	15.037449211272952
In seeing Bingley , her thoughts naturally flew to her sister ;	53.708791053103305
Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match ;	91.38329286713865
A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood , since you went away .	32.916435247358685
I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude ;	53.81146453527896
and though Philips , as well as her sister , stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good humour encouraged , yet , whenever she did speak , she must be vulgar .	4.894904075631905
Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family , they did not attempt to oppose it , for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants , while they waited at table , and judged it better that one only of the household , and the one whom they could most trust , should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject .	2.2831488941289635
It was only said , 'Lately , George Wickham , Esq .	53.71510125758551
It will be her turn soon to be teazed , said Miss Lucas .	36.708343284491946
Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one ;	126.07739456675078
We accordingly went and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend , the certain evils of such a choice .	8.887229499877446
Indeed he has no improper pride .	282.84237656843413
and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane , and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do .	5.930818346966433
There is something a little stately in him to be sure , replied her aunt , but it is confined to his air , and is not unbecoming .	8.060347512600085
By Elizabeth's instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband , which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself .	5.533362126581293
From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent .	183.18064256654824
I shall not say that you are mistaken , he replied , because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ;	9.354455834988627
Blame you !	4743.677376410631
She will be married !	883.1296080482515
Is he married or single ?	472.51125484192454
but she sat down , resolving within herself , to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man .	11.516658331307083
And with regard to the resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the former were excited by his marrying me , it would not give me one moment's concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn .	3.62875441003195
She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject , and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect .	9.571759552006121
The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister , will prove what she felt .	20.441424609162773
I am the less surprised at what has happened , replied Sir William , from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire .	4.908719785509349
If you are redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase Project Gutenberg associated with or appearing on the work , you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1 .	5.781415456059701
I did not think Caroline in spirits , were her words , but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London .	5.7754141886260255
That reply will do for the present .	182.99484817284574
But , unluckily for her ladyship , its effect had been exactly contrariwise .	35.333399314397425
Their parties abroad were less varied than before ;	126.18976559310643
The indirect boast ;	1852.3706106999628
Till I was in Kent , and saw so much both of Darcy and his relation , Colonel Fitzwilliam , I was ignorant of the truth myself .	7.961543982082973
cried Elizabeth .	3961.228037884354
YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE , STRICT LIABILITY , BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1 .	8.299057738918526
But she had no reason to fear and Gardiner's curiosity ;	72.11091222318139
Collins , however , was not discouraged from speaking again , and Darcy's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech , and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way .	4.485354234230498
but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley's inattention .	58.31426347240793
Presuming , however , that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment , than any dislike of the proposal , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of society , a perfect willingness to accept it , she ventured to engage for her attendance , and the day after the next was fixed on .	3.16414261290671
Indeed , Eliza , you will be as welcome to me as either of them .	27.571926363836052
for on the very morning after their own arrival at Lambton , these visitors came .	25.149622673875697
This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ;	9.781929022730507
safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune .	126.07739456675078
What is your own opinion ?	474.4862416312743
and Bennet , who could by no means wish for so speedy a return , immediately said , But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here , my good sir ?	6.063476523611781
He meant to provide for me amply , and thought he had done it ;	30.58680772458578
To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew ;	16.807471039756887
If I were not afraid of judging harshly , I should be almost tempted to say , that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this .	7.890141183823019
And , my dear Jane , I never saw you look in greater beauty .	32.43950941769356
His misfortunes !	4746.7831582453555
The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt .	36.61970032525936
and had this led to no suspicion , the faces of both as they hastily turned round , and moved away from each other , would have told it all .	6.82966324751938
6 .	15895.509420740158
How much I shall have to tell !	193.93773068108393
and whatever he did , done gracefully .	182.91233416528254
It was a large , well-proportioned room , handsomely fitted up .	53.818482292896825
She sat intently at work , striving to be composed , and without daring to lift up her eyes , till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister , as the servant was approaching the door .	4.759107211494942
They entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds ;	12.282113917609852
but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome .	53.77426892971403
A place too , with which so many of your acquaintance are connected .	35.318018276957545
and in spite of every thing , was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune .	11.594658947679354
Take care , Lizzy ;	872.7545377705296
And this , said she , is the end of all his friend's anxious circumspection !	29.6082000722037
for that will have more weight in the argument , Miss Bennet , than you may be aware of .	16.988042744319536
assuring him that Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ;	10.33000970409017
when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet , she turned suddenly towards him and said , By the bye , Charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield ?	5.49218582223684
She looked at Jane , to see how she bore it ;	56.39344794844049
I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which I am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before .	4.877008202743932
If one could but go to Brighton !	182.96107689114163
and Elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject .	69.50218284373004
She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley .	91.3336994971489
the gentlemen being out , they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere .	35.3334803997677
Gardiner , to whom the chief of this news had been given before , in the course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with her , made her sister a slight answer , and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation .	4.526692050679578
Let me write for you , said Jane , if you dislike the trouble yourself .	28.116264245687706
The happiness which this reply produced , was such as he had probably never felt before ;	22.41201742807444
And , above all things , keep Bennet from fighting .	69.21630222330865
Oh !	8965.45062507954
I never heard any harm of her ;	183.99293104160637
By supposing such an affection , you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong , and me most unhappy .	15.022470135291591
I can recal nothing worse .	472.86796479965085
Their lodgings were not long a secret , and at length they began to know the officers themselves .	17.598573387813712
I like her appearance , said Elizabeth , struck with other ideas .	50.96827190224034
We had better go into the avenue .	182.99656710860864
I am prodigiously proud of him .	282.4123584095834
and it was not wholly without foundation .	193.88270457075689
Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune , which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day .	4.7349882985318805
Those who chose to be idle , certainly might .	96.1344675255156
You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble ;	15.01036952683973
To Jane herself , she exclaimed , there could be no possibility of objection .	30.595273914566803
It was all conjecture .	873.3008399674139
Elizabeth merely curtseyed to him , without saying a word .	77.04532742058015
You taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous .	30.58727091041914
but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected .	35.36307528394026
and nothing therefore remained to be done , but to think well of them both , to defend the conduct of each , and throw into the account of accident or mistake , whatever could not be otherwise explained .	4.644254122061632
What is there of good to be expected ?	126.69139935975254
It is what every body says .	282.48183428411977
Every body is disgusted with his pride .	183.16570495715496
said her sister .	1854.9554321945773
and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield , I should probably be off in five minutes .	16.846632516135365
adding , that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it .	17.522920706081404
When I am in company with him , I will not be wishing .	41.884797742821654
His surprise was great .	873.2116359335714
and they have another , who lives somewhere near Cheapside .	69.05082434520934
At length , however , his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family .	11.265567175544879
Of a fine , stout , healthy love it may .	68.98385176489435
She remembered also , that till the Netherfield family had quitted the country , he had told his story to no one but herself ;	9.55686661501294
I am not ashamed of having been mistaken or , at least , it is slight , it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters .	5.490463815146941
She shall hear my opinion .	471.6152006322248
It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ;	21.749327028970093
I am far from attributing any part of Bingley's conduct to design , said Elizabeth ;	26.086894713086863
The second began .	1852.3706106999628
This is a wretched beginning indeed !	283.07092153141235
a favourite with her mother , whose affection had brought her into public at an early age .	19.611000248794042
I am so happy .	935.7577586663324
He stood by her , however , for some minutes , in silence ;	38.80000718916707
She will be taken good care of .	184.5749035788137
I should like to know how he behaves among strangers .	72.01988409744398
Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Wickham .	25.155352768271868
Yes certainly .	4747.960692348283
Your's , c .	1649.7163939346244
Poor dear child !	1860.4034109326622
Your sister I also watched .	471.9878147802151
The sisters , on hearing this , repeated three or four times how much they were grieved , how shocking it was to have a bad cold , and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves ;	5.097940755647428
For the last week they had seen very little of either Lady Catherine or her daughter .	22.429436773416448
If that had been nearer , she would not have gone so soon .	36.62463676739746
It is nearly fifty miles .	471.8542217062196
Seriously , however , she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's concurrence .	16.124375236615023
Very , very much .	875.3628094531122
Charlotte did not stay much longer , and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard .	16.487408190651756
for as to Darcy's using him ill , it is perfectly false ;	43.04804032682585
Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit , but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it .	10.343602104516666
A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant ;	18.573273504251386
and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects .	47.541489667167376
Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think , without feeling that she had been blind , partial , prejudiced , absurd .	11.981299896674336
She was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when .	15.870446937130632
Her affections had been continually fluctuating , but never without an object .	43.046570027904586
You are joking , Lizzy .	472.2019723359574
You dislike an argument , and want to silence this .	68.88291816043548
Darcy , who was leaning against the mantle-piece with his eyes fixed on her face , seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise .	7.9599027103571345
My dear Madam , he replied , this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what I have been hoping to receive ;	11.320460662361912
Ring the bell , Kitty , for Hill .	126.07739456675078
He was always to have gone on Saturday , and to Saturday he still meant to stay .	19.006095544816755
Believe me , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that your modesty , so far from doing you any disservice , rather adds to your other perfections .	9.095154395479138
The gentlemen arrived early ;	872.8811074345388
How is such a man to be worked on ?	95.68201158614708
Merely to the illustration of your character , said she , endeavouring to shake off her gravity .	21.99030573827639
and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned , and preparing her to be surprised , she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Darcy and herself .	4.81498532613429
but I am afraid of alarming you be assured that we are all well .	30.701150475728785
I am , said he , with a firm voice .	86.18499871571554
Let her be called down .	472.27931004825064
It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first .	13.527775769896852
Removed !	15895.509420740158
In the first place , she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter ;	31.260125992796482
My dear , dear Lydia !	445.5499665766152
Impossible .	15895.509420740158
Reynolds could interest her on no other point .	126.7684574716793
Is this , thought Elizabeth , meant for me ?	95.78648763842011
and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves , and meanly of others .	19.57705419302471
and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration of her , of her former favourite George Wickham ;	7.786614418941811
He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate , generous heart in the world ;	13.944151994852477
and after observing that he was a very gentleman-like man , asked her how she had liked him .	17.613804223541273
To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either .	43.052974521937784
Do you play and sing , Miss Bennet ?	126.42313400920199
No principle of either , would be violated by my marriage with Darcy .	35.31946552315783
You will be censured , slighted , and despised , by every one connected with him .	22.438472776246815
Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural ;	13.528060981370063
Aye , so it is , cried her mother , and Long does not come back till the day before ;	14.72886645173857
With all my heart ;	873.7053418118694
on his side even more .	474.85357993752467
Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality , especially on Lydia's side , but nothing to give him any alarm .	9.805391939578886
His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage , for Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane , in order to have the earliest assurance of it ;	5.487478201193413
But she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow .	30.64790491877462
my last letter had never reached her .	183.2912645300379
I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford .	25.148087922213723
Oh , my dear Lizzy !	522.1878759023307
He was well , but so much engaged with Darcy , that they scarcely ever saw him .	19.006095544816755
but , instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to Miss Bennet , I beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so I took the liberty of coming to ask .	3.4948207748397926
but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic .	56.26485504187547
for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement , they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning , from all those who were not immediately on the spot .	5.435994687668648
After pausing on this point a considerable while , she once more continued to read .	25.15648712389803
and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her .	25.987882799789624
Her own thoughts were employing her .	282.4280506904258
1 .	10898.860396037358
and his attachment to Wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me , to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow , and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant .	2.9114099478775257
Mary would not understand them ;	472.84243660369384
The situation of your mother's family , though objectionable , was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently , so almost uniformly betrayed by herself , by your three younger sisters , and occasionally even by your father .	4.2193144635353335
The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Bennet's visit , and determining when they should ask him to dinner .	8.777396020125755
The country is a vast deal pleasanter , is not it , Bingley ?	36.61970032525936
I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man , without having a wish beyond it .	8.613703580645959
and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct , who will believe me ?	15.92366440204915
Smiles decked the face of Bennet , as the carriage drove up to the door ;	25.98720537438182
When convinced on that article , Miss Bennet had nothing farther to wish .	35.317055301057025
and Bennet , in the meanwhile , was giving way to all the happy schemes , which the good humour , and common politeness of Bingley , in half an hour's visit , had revived .	5.314340546875752
But her conclusion was false ;	471.61294093744067
yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Gardiner thought of him , and Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's beginning the subject .	9.307580512069846
No , she would go home .	299.7400969564968
No , never .	1857.2855533423947
He is a pleasant fellow , and would jilt you creditably .	53.756253274425795
Jane had been a week in town , without either seeing or hearing from Caroline .	25.246536025315972
for though feeling almost secure , and with reason , for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging , he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday .	8.316630200509469
Well , then supposing them to be in London .	95.79380835016993
Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related .	91.64850618103364
The apothecary came , and having examined his patient , said , as might be supposed , that she had caught a violent cold , and that they must endeavour to get the better of it ;	5.28381329167506
Teazing , teazing , man !	471.56144177488665
and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Wickham's attentions .	49.169671857891075
I was right , therefore ;	472.2409275954135
I pity you , Miss Eliza , for this discovery of your favourite's guilt ;	32.78033991362818
and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see .	29.559843869307986
They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday ;	91.34643824464112
It was exactly a scene , and exactly among people , where he had apparently least to do , and least temptation to go .	10.010519723953918
The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade , and within view of his own warehouses , could have been so well bred and agreeable .	5.778428814838145
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule .	29.635736383822913
My mind however is now made up on the subject , for having received ordination at Easter , I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh , widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh , whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish , where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship , and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church of England .	2.1131348114891395
No ;	13601.676459159366
I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude .	21.742663530657804
The general prejudice against Darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton , to attempt to place him in an amiable light .	6.276262176653047
and as for Purvis Lodge , the attics are dreadful .	68.93245624616468
When Bennet was told of this , she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected , considering what her anxiety for his life had been before .	7.347456202898852
He spoke of it as a certain event , of which the time alone could be undecided .	18.99680514302862
Elizabeth soon observed , and instantly understood it .	126.78656619418932
But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness , is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging .	13.540380524287574
You are too hasty , Sir , she cried .	91.41701807147977
What do you keep winking at me for ?	127.01881097368599
On the very last day of the regiment's remaining in Meryton , he dined with others of the officers at Longbourn ;	12.300275024126286
Wickham of course wanted more than he could get ;	91.42799757034444
Elizabeth was glad of it ;	472.08636506449994
she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes ;	91.38329286713865
but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry .	126.35825106321556
However little Darcy might have liked such an address , he contented himself with coolly replying , that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned , no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer .	4.835733354402614
and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too !	91.65185088429212
but the ladies were ready enough to talk , and Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement , nor inclined to be silent himself .	9.566395891144424
said Jane .	4751.986131603042
You are very cautious , I suppose , as to its being created .	40.08569263143424
The feelings of the person who wrote , and the person who received it , are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circumstance attending it , ought to be forgotten .	4.988206686765802
My dearest Lizzy will , I am sure , be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment , at my expence , when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me .	5.240665479256321
though we can never be what we once were to each other .	43.07573270507367
in looking back to what they had feared , only two hours ago , she felt all the advantages of what they had gained .	9.92805940230317
Console Lady Catherine as well as you can .	126.07739456675078
Lizzy , said her father , I have given him my consent .	49.59958739589261
But good lord !	1852.3193863639972
Hate you !	4743.677376410631
I pity , though I cannot help blaming her .	91.3296803691227
He left Netherfield for London , on the day following , as you , I am certain , remember , with the design of soon returning .	8.777460522319473
His sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own ;	68.89690238497923
Darcy was fixed in astonishment .	474.07750036956344
But slyness seems the fashion .	471.61294093744067
Are you quite sure , Ma'am ?	283.92185932113
As I did the other day , said Elizabeth , with a conscious smile ;	37.63755240293386
And is such a girl to be my nephew's sister ?	68.88603074550605
His anxiety for Jane was evident , and his attentions to herself most pleasing , and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others .	5.436005388510948
What I have to say relates to poor Lydia .	91.3594801891674
and though her resolution was not to be shaken , her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation .	18.334273688257912
Pray go to see them , with Sir William and Maria .	53.798675801919615
The only pain was in leaving her father , who would certainly miss her , and who , when it came to the point , so little liked her going , that he told her to write to him , and almost promised to answer her letter .	3.71175486613335
My dear Bennet , replied his wife , how can you be so tiresome !	33.734880649803245
Affectation of candour is common enough ;	282.32115989634974
of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt .	43.035708093730584
He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him , to lay his private actions open to the world .	6.560467786731041
The whole party have left Netherfield by this time , and are on their way to town ;	19.048325532922707
I know it to be impossible .	299.5624710088981
I have written to Colonel Forster , to inform him of our present arrangements , and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Wickham in and near Brighton , with assurances of speedy payment , for which I have pledged myself .	3.9288401774859105
What , has she frightened away some of your lovers ?	68.89798468115647
You have no compassion on my poor nerves .	126.27198188541378
She wanted to hear of him , when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence .	21.71670326343814
Are not you curious to hear how it was managed ?	68.99262769125288
Poor Wickham ;	4767.690094325646
for she had a lively , playful disposition , which delighted in any thing ridiculous .	25.22461786929218
What do you think ?	881.8917100523443
Her many attractions were again dwelt on , and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy , and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter .	5.435911137396409
She had instinctively turned away ;	472.0822604597714
Kitty , run down and order the carriage .	126.34641463727803
When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose , the tables were broke up , the carriage was offered to Collins , gratefully accepted , and immediately ordered .	5.96218799573661
I cannot blame myself for having done thus much .	91.4268718127157
Their situation was awkward enough ;	472.0964291441105
When you have killed all your own birds , Bingley , said her mother , I beg you will come here , and shoot as many as you please , on Bennet's manor .	6.2237405532251415
and her expectations of advantage to her family , when in a happy humour , were so far beyond reason , that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day , to make his proposals .	4.7112504480297845
Do not involve yourself , or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent .	10.342323918030106
There is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping , I dare say .	61.78693939318652
your name will never even be mentioned by any of us .	53.69533281330631
but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame .	91.334049870353
Copyright laws in most countries are in a constant state of change .	43.035708093730584
Can it be possible that he will marry her ?	91.50792920719019
Oh , no .	1856.8414363661354
Bennet replied that he had not .	299.2657464714657
But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister , or say half that remained to be said , for the present .	10.396142795744192
My dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts .	57.5129177977276
All that is known after this is , that they were seen to continue the London road .	19.596738172975048
Good gracious !	4123.65795852664
You must learn some of my philosophy .	183.19371944300408
But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife , as I certainly did .	4.015306553772855
Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family ;	44.756258170334306
How shall we punish him for such a speech ?	91.3611654082918
and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house , walked quietly into it herself .	16.802798548425134
But wishes were vain ;	872.8593830911467
Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety ;	68.95422496861939
It ought to be good , he replied , it has been the work of many generations .	21.306418332615095
Lydia left a few lines for his wife , informing her of their intention .	29.579985167674803
His understanding and temper , though unlike her own , would have answered all her wishes .	22.415874584433293
But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about .	13.541862814557103
Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman , who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable .	11.514882239737826
He never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much ;	13.525100550503293
blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing .	13.524223900860871
She looked at her father to entreat his interference , lest Mary should be singing all night .	19.11164772719555
From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents .	35.34158534815997
1 .	10898.860396037358
But however insincere you may choose to be , you shall not find me so .	25.988691938195394
I knew how it would be .	293.0225945351744
Why , my dear , you must know , Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England ;	9.59342771377957
Perfectly so I thank you .	471.56144177488665
and the girls had the pleasure of hearing , as they entered the drawing-room , that Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation , and was then in the house .	7.582908706656436
repeated Darcy contemptuously ;	1852.072171128788
and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling , was more openly acknowledged , for she did not scruple to call out , What is that you are saying , Fitzwilliam ?	5.681264282467652
Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined .	68.89391603519981
but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ;	21.71676006523128
Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Collins and myself on this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of another : of which we have been advertised by the same authority .	4.7463226795350675
and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love , and the object of that love , her friend Eliza , she sat herself seriously to work to find it out .	5.023408166800633
Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life ;	35.4656594165641
This is not quite enough to make her understand his character .	59.77549722722504
in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise , and where he was reduced to meet , frequently meet , reason with , persuade , and finally bribe , the man whom he always most wished to avoid , and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce .	2.9641639306418606
You may ask questions , which I shall not choose to answer .	43.09020577814943
It is very unlucky ;	873.3506133063007
From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Darcy had been over-rated , Elizabeth had never yet answered Gardiner's long letter , but now , having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome , she was almost ashamed to find , that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as follows : I would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as I ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory , detail of particulars ;	2.108392822696969
Your's , c .	1649.7163939346244
I see your design , Bingley , said his friend .	74.06124234728988
He will be forgot , and we shall all be as we were before .	31.66544916954414
E1 through 1 .	1726.7418462678622
My dear , dear aunt , she rapturously cried , what delight !	43.201011985121646
And gravely glancing at Darcy , There is a fine old saying , which every body here is of course familiar with 'Keep your breath to cool your porridge , ' and I shall keep mine to swell my song .	4.358629652430307
The Lucases are very artful people indeed , sister .	91.33489401897373
Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement , but was too much oppressed to make any reply .	19.578290418233763
You need not .	1852.4813488728942
You have a sweet room here , Bingley , and a charming prospect over that gravel walk .	19.013253251105517
My fingers , said Elizabeth , do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women's do .	11.474913726753591
But it was her business to be satisfied and certainly her temper to be happy ;	25.24829850001285
Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there ( an invitation moreover including the whole party ) so immediately after your arrival !	7.792108056567555
At last she recollected that she had been travelling , and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance .	12.795586849955335
Her aunt asked her , smilingly , how she liked it .	53.709682471599315
it was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small fortune , and however uncertain of giving happiness , must be their pleasantest preservative from want .	7.334468496279696
and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her , she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both , and could very sincerely wish him happy .	4.995360641380911
At present I have not room to do them justice .	69.52139530453987
She studied every sentence : and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different .	21.71670326343814
I will think no more about him .	183.14857370966772
II .	15895.509420740158
The evening passed quietly , unmarked by any thing extraordinary .	69.21084737157189
She found that she was to receive no other answer and , after a short pause , added , I think I have understood that Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again ?	5.713432106341392
She tried to recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence , that might rescue him from the attacks of Darcy ;	8.299382951239055
I comfort myself with thinking , replied Jane , that he certainly would not marry Lydia , if he had not a real regard for her .	9.454589749576112
When the gentlemen had joined them , and tea was over , the card tables were placed .	20.209870128942345
The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541 .	68.88060192205867
They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world .	35.40974838972826
They agreed that Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct ;	10.770170017017396
Is that his design in settling here ?	183.2163104796807
My dear Jane !	1855.3966256426422
I assure you , I feel it exceedingly , said Lady Catherine ;	47.12161528617833
I am quite well .	873.0928609222244
VOL .	13586.708929614973
I must think your language too strong in speaking of both , replied Jane , and I hope you will be convinced of it , by seeing them happy together .	7.45231731098185
and to see dear Wickham too !	283.80902713370944
It is well .	1853.4777041522884
Miss Bingley made no answer ;	475.9325885280623
Lizzy is not a bit better than the others ;	95.83571645017619
will she be as tall as I am ?	126.07739456675078
His marriage was now fast approaching , and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable , and even repeatedly to say in an ill-natured tone that she wished they might be happy .	5.190395055723956
Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation .	91.33824067289287
Every time they met , it was more decided and remarkable .	55.99095669458585
and he scarcely opened his lips .	282.7706434991213
Her sister , however , assured her , of her being perfectly well ;	36.62566092350164
It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on such occasions it is the etiquette ;	13.892965359841844
My temper I dare not vouch for .	182.95624661430412
Anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn .	26.49383801468321
You have a very small park here , returned Lady Catherine after a short silence .	26.521091325761684
They lagged behind , while Elizabeth , Kitty , and Darcy , were to entertain each other .	19.57943636381756
it was really attentive ;	875.4944583748846
That you certainly shall .	873.314200916417
and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance , were I distractedly in love with him , I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance .	6.278425774537433
her daughters , alarmed , anxious , uneasy .	126.55438690341512
but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer , larger picture of him than this .	16.856999306924713
While Mary is adjusting her ideas , he continued , let us return to Bingley .	26.024159373821515
If he did shrug his shoulders , it was not till Sir William was out of sight .	21.396305861123444
I do not get on at all .	183.22468028469797
What should not you mind ?	471.79674056764355
And since this sad affair has taken place , it is said , that he left Meryton greatly in debt ;	13.891070466223772
Let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many mortifications , for the sake of discovering them .	4.626648466966352
it is a handsome face .	474.70480968987323
Vain indeed must be all her attentions , vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself , if he were already self-destined to another .	7.060829867358011
I don't know .	1852.194383273414
One must speak a little , you know .	126.32484791257149
Who that knows what his misfortunes have been , can help feeling an interest in him ?	22.44737859128947
and , while pretending to admire her work , said in a whisper , Go to your father , he wants you in the library .	9.504949864037112
Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character , and as she stood before the canvas , on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before ;	3.1860463476664904
F1 .	15895.509420740158
I am perfectly satisfied .	878.569239508356
Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure .	8.295939768159858
For we must attribute this happy conclusion , she added , in a great measure , to his kindness .	16.82274728796011
With astonishment did Elizabeth see , that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself .	16.810039976242106
Section 2 .	4743.677376410631
Jane was beyond competition her favourite child .	183.5463500791864
When first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him ;	30.594035121217736
Mary wished to say something very sensible , but knew not how .	43.107113164312686
Perhaps , said Darcy , I should have judged better , had I sought an introduction , but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers .	9.053747570653382
If an individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are located in the United States , we do not claim a right to prevent you from copying , distributing , performing , displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg are removed .	3.1868396320390575
F4 .	15895.509420740158
Elizabeth coloured , and said A little .	182.93276980679664
She then yawned again , threw aside her book , and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement ;	11.242038162633706
Two days after Bennet's return , as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them , and , concluding that she came to call them to their mother , went forward to meet her ;	3.9357145321971965
Email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and official page at <URL> For additional contact information : Gregory B Newby Chief Executive and Director gbnewby<MENTION> .	5.215437674786147
Elizabeth said no more but her mind could not acquiesce .	68.88296806941361
Collins , seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her , but Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine's being rather displeased by her staying at home .	3.8830526696857706
on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree , for in Darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against another .	4.742218057857562
It is Wickham's intention to go into the regulars ;	95.68879511030804
She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at , and it was rather too early to begin .	13.465086496816511
Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house ;	43.09544223042713
and whether she wished or feared it most , she could scarcely determine .	35.30615862652983
and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss De Bourgh , which I am certain he has very much at heart .	7.029077589264558
its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines , crowded with the young and the gay , and dazzling with scarlet ;	11.228419059099583
who attended to you ?	876.7604997548386
Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way .	43.046570027904586
His character was decided .	879.9197929748784
was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs .	69.2045748736591
Come , Darcy , said he , I must have you dance .	53.899122330027254
but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , Gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible .	4.3834656061291195
No , Lizzy , that is what I do not choose .	56.01321204306022
He is as fine a fellow , said Bennet , as soon as they were out of the house , as ever I saw .	12.726078010485693
and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford between our pools at quadrille , while Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh's foot-stool , that she said , 'Collins , you must marry .	5.022042992843013
They could describe an entertainment with accuracy , relate an anecdote with humour , and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit .	12.601503961150447
It would vex me , indeed , to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard .	17.614570459450633
Your cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings .	126.16695397791044
However , I recollected afterwards , that if he had been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for Darcy might have done as well .	7.08698201907559
Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets ;	91.40203351655094
Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts , sarcastic humour , reserve , and caprice , that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character .	5.018111260241332
You are mistaken .	1855.1473838906081
and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that Jane must soon cease to regard it , in the enjoyment of his .	8.322436560844443
Two inferences , however , were plainly deduced from the whole ;	56.13601396628969
Oh !	8965.45062507954
He is a gentleman ;	874.438529998522
Believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention ;	22.639004491849764
and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh , I think it will be very tolerable .	12.60800908735859
Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin's praise ;	29.637888500795427
and returned no more , till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining-parlour .	21.716005837894702
and when she rose to take leave , Elizabeth , ashamed of her mother's ungracious and reluctant good wishes , and sincerely affected herself , accompanied her out of the room .	6.475329519497307
She saw him start at this , but he said nothing , and she continued , You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it .	4.912408154863104
very true , it will be wise in me to refrain from that .	37.40671756118444
No , replied Jane , I have not forgotten him ;	82.03548627639262
Every disposition of the ground was good ;	183.16570495715496
You never see a fault in any body .	126.09530015792555
Consider Collins's respectability , and Charlotte's prudent , steady character .	68.87435935390347
I now give it to you , if you are resolved on having him .	30.585138613205924
Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy .	126.09540457175159
and as she named their relationship to herself , she stole a sly look at him , to see how he bore it ;	10.864252456375972
Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane ;	25.15470016933647
You write uncommonly fast .	872.9280715099725
Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation , but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view .	13.54303244714878
In his present behaviour to herself , moreover , she had a fresh source of displeasure , for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance , could only serve , after what had since passed , to provoke her .	3.477914918131036
Well , that was very decided indeed that does seem as if but however , it may all come to nothing you know .	10.338305589135922
Mamma would like to go too of all things !	91.32606463305149
By tea-time however the dose had been enough , and Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again , and when tea was over , glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies .	4.856107532294184
Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family , she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort .	9.270125100521712
but she was proud of him .	284.18790493673947
What are men to rocks and mountains ?	182.98185371827176
Well , much good may it do them !	126.28721896735865
If he had not had a family of his own , I and my children must have had all his money you know , and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him , except a few presents .	4.183399331373601
They met several times , for there was much to be discussed .	44.7335711979261
The quiet , the retirement of such a life , would have answered all my ideas of happiness !	17.29580866379148
I only want to think you perfect , and you set yourself against it .	29.54329651169766
Of Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well ;	43.09651662890626
Chuse properly , chuse a gentlewoman for my sake ;	91.32606463305149
Among those who are at all his equals in consequence , he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous .	9.086267556378813
Those that best pleased her , as placing his conduct in the noblest light , seemed most improbable .	16.856078173551275
His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped , and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment , maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance , and except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth , requiring no partner in his pleasure .	3.810394413505035
Collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said , thanking her for every fish he won , and apologising if he thought he won too many .	6.933295857302922
I have been a disappointed man , and my spirits will not bear solitude .	29.63175616794848
They solaced their wretchedness , however , by duets after supper , while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister .	4.194267804842921
for his chief wish at present , was to have as little trouble in the business as possible .	16.806026321990664
Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions , but answered them very composedly .	29.637888500795427
and their mother's fortune , though ample for her situation in life , could but ill supply the deficiency of his .	12.957833256567408
You must write again very soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last .	14.276161217341695
They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas ;	182.95171395137166
So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper , or her affectionate heart .	10.59660846786683
and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament ;	16.85646264649689
Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation , that he never again distressed himself , or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth , by introducing the subject of it ;	7.146519015103185
At such an assembly as this , it would be insupportable .	61.521890131344776
From what can it proceed ?	475.0954995223489
Her father was walking about the room , looking grave and anxious .	44.89222010137898
The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion .	53.8977915925362
my dear father , she cried , come back , and write immediately .	38.92661881802847
As to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say she could not positively answer but she did not know of any prepossession ;	8.482697228432533
I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed !	68.89104509997004
He has more to give .	472.72467063278566
An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched ;	126.49047972269389
Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to , it was not on her side a scheme of infamy .	18.00744592537318
Their taking her home , and affording her their personal protection and countenance , is such a sacrifice to her advantage , as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge .	6.924838566028275
and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes , but his eagerness to grasp at any thing .	10.334211250062797
I believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as I wished it in reason .	25.144158078458087
My sisters may write to me .	282.4074691992821
No , no , nonsense , Lizzy .	184.3429147778419
John told us Darcy was here when you sent for us ;	53.69533281330631
Not , however , from any fear of disadvantage from it , individually to herself ;	25.15737160652152
Many smiled ;	4775.128987276426
It is impossible .	1853.4777041522884
She was convinced that she could have been happy with him ;	57.30901614833279
All !	15949.330370833817
While I can have my mornings to myself , said she , it is enough .	29.558333721952064
One day's delay she observed , would be of small importance ;	53.78210820802474
I flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so .	35.30624493575843
He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday , to say that he had arrived in safety , and to give me his directions , which I particularly begged him to do .	6.051458795841062
There could not exist in the world two men , over whom Darcy could have such boundless influence .	16.806520219957214
I never was .	1857.0702947193065
Her uncle and aunt were all amazement ;	192.989024383017
The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story , gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach ;	8.299433831416374
In 2001 , the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations .	10.4301466147325
and , as far as their acquaintance reached , there was no fault to find .	26.872338665022003
and , in the imprudence of anger , took the first opportunity of saying , with sneering civility , Pray , Miss Eliza , are not the shire militia removed from Meryton ?	6.290364356943747
It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong ;	53.71510125758551
I knew it to be a most respectable , agreeable corps , and my friend Denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters , and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them .	4.793860351702222
They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother .	68.95443294897402
They were able to love each other , even as well as they intended .	29.56989300571525
Wickham will never marry a woman without some money .	91.42799757034444
That is the most unforgiving speech , said Elizabeth , that I ever heard you utter .	25.762066419635513
How despicably have I acted !	471.8086080262547
I am sure , said she , I cried for two days together when Colonel Millar's regiment went away .	18.72752116254992
Then addressing her daughter , Oh !	283.0240943772145
she added , by far too much .	183.03688621994775
I know my own strength , and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming .	22.42907232865147
I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter , that I had known it , and purposely kept it from him .	6.649178123792371
He owns it himself without disguise .	282.36081194777387
and though , in looking forward , neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity , could be justly expected for her sister ;	12.287210494710367
Wickham's attention was caught ;	877.3807182427697
Excuse me for I must speak plainly .	182.9046321206164
cried Gardiner .	4751.0788029920595
Your mother insists upon your accepting it .	184.1252772590404
so easy , that every servant will cheat you ;	91.50792920719019
Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself ?	282.66476573817044
You used us abominably ill , answered Hurst , in running away without telling us that you were coming out .	13.52525810017634
and all three being actuated by one spirit , every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled .	16.839852178244207
and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane ;	15.009504513703286
Oh !	8965.45062507954
He had always intended to visit him , though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go ;	13.135524533952298
Perhaps I am not doing her justice .	183.16570495715496
Oh !	8965.45062507954
How long has she been such a favourite ?	126.12931381244024
You had much better dance .	471.6466798211467
for she was in no cheerful humour .	193.92867893577838
I certainly have had my share of beauty , but I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now .	14.760538568675317
Elizabeth asked questions in vain ;	471.6471768839811
I am sure I do not know .	220.8810135709955
How wonderfully these sort of things occur !	182.98574828639642
Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure .	53.69533281330631
I am very glad to hear such a good account of her , said Lady Catherine ;	21.771546334958344
but I will make her know it .	183.09866929837398
I am sorry , exceedingly sorry , replied Darcy , in a tone of surprise and emotion , that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness .	5.353446004180163
But when they had withdrawn , he said to her , Bennet , before you take any , or all of these houses , for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding .	4.913027617260364
LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a defect in this electronic work within <TIME_PERIOD > of receiving it , you can receive a refund of the money ( if any ) you paid for it by sending a written explanation to the person you received the work from .	3.3148720178584044
If she is half as sharp as her mother , she is saving enough .	30.5903650640888
and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate , she began to regret that he came .	10.588723739253485
If he no longer cares for me , why silent ?	69.00114822595985
and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town , as Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them , on their first coming to London , before they procured lodgings .	4.456461167694447
But I suppose you had no opportunity .	183.04375019823956
But Bennet , who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday , which would exactly finish Jane's week , could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before .	5.530467201847515
and , for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings , care not how much I may be wounding your's .	12.131574222237354
and lastly , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked .	4.558685211702539
that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders , and that the business had been compromised accordingly .	15.875097437578555
Bingley had not been of age two years , when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House .	11.545334666608747
Their journey was performed without much conversation , or any alarm ;	53.73474210519279
Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do .	35.36063440189834
but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us , if I had not perceived , by Jane's letter last Wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it , and therefore what I now tell you , can give you no fresh pain .	2.8849522917783186
In the former were many good paintings ;	183.3513425769041
and if you can compass it , do cure the younger girls of running after the officers .	19.052202584477495
Collins will be very glad of your company , I am sure .	49.021163980739985
When he was gone , they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on , and their uncle promised , at parting , to prevail on Bennet to return to Longbourn , as soon as he could , to the great consolation of his sister , who considered it as the only security for her husband's not being killed in a duel .	2.7104644232919033
and thirdly which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness .	6.668168252625901
Elizabeth shook her head over this letter .	182.93276980679664
Do your sisters play and sing ?	282.57744400285765
When the ladies removed after dinner , Elizabeth ran up to her sister , and seeing her well guarded from cold , attended her into the drawing-room ;	8.822208995076922
He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man ;	183.0866522573219
I hardly know how Collins was first introduced to her notice , but he certainly has not known her long .	14.265218406635723
and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters , and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense .	6.362072452543711
To Jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merit she had undervalued ;	12.283876498965272
It settled the matter ;	872.893442393082
Collins might never make the offer , and till he did , it was useless to quarrel about him .	15.436942331195096
no , my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both .	19.0332725950099
It was more than civil ;	471.8297747705117
If it were merely a fine house richly furnished , said she , I should not care about it myself ;	16.76608209687803
She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man ;	15.431915243087657
Bennet deigned not to make any reply ;	193.0150115051751
Had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place ?	43.07061945210439
Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed , and , while her courage was high , she immediately said , Darcy , I am a very selfish creature ;	6.480100380310977
When Bennet wrote again to his brother , therefore , he sent his permission for them to come ;	16.806903930011686
but how could that be ?	471.61766773082417
And a special licence .	872.9911838121304
and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them , he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing , and called out to her , My dear Miss Eliza , why are not you dancing ?	4.855407703851314
Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all , but she could see it and write of it without material pain .	12.605654751400541
She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way .	7.794685847225728
Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from Charlotte , as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling .	9.557104199122916

Mary was obliged to mix more with the world , but she could still moralize over every morning visit ;	15.883917992599619
I am going to-morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality , who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him .	8.31993633502722
and the good-natured wishes for her well-doing , which had proceeded before , from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton , lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances , because with such an husband , her misery was considered certain .	3.825150125512129
Two offences of a very different nature , and by no means of equal magnitude , you last night laid to my charge .	10.60272440465743

Redistribution is subject to the trademark license , especially commercial redistribution .	53.69533281330631
but the emotion was short , and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued .	19.60312180098488
Very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia , whose own misery was extreme , and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family .	6.437269213857868
Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable ;	91.38329286713865
Do you prefer reading to cards ?	283.22460356926354
where is your sash my dear ?	284.1273713928716
but I thought I might as well buy it as not .	55.97528583783146
But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together ;	21.716651236722495
CHAPTER III .	4747.787542098787
Soon after their return , a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet ;	43.035708093730584
and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there , recurring to her mind , the few minutes in which they continued together , were some of the most uncomfortable of her life .	5.311274484726868
Jane listened with astonishment and concern ;	282.5423181007908
We must have Long and the Gouldings soon .	126.7008588108492
Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer ;	53.767113468916946
and while Sir William accompanied him , Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house , extremely well pleased , probably , to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's help .	5.443871451809173
He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance , but that is all .	15.684510626096333
It is the greatest of favours when Miss De Bourgh comes in .	43.052034843341474
They had long wished to see him .	183.4123045257573
At length the chaise arrived , the trunks were fastened on , the parcels placed within , and it was pronounced to be ready .	10.160418872144673
I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way .	26.98209921014263
for thither Collins had followed him after breakfast , and there he would continue , nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection , but really talking to Bennet , with little cessation , of his house and garden at Hunsford .	3.9286543349717142
He , who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open pleasantry .	9.557004023075454
Compared with some families , I believe we were ;	91.32606463305149
In this room they were received by Miss Darcy , who was sitting there with Hurst and Miss Bingley , and the lady with whom she lived in London .	8.1226000933101
She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it ;	58.26179576249481
Do not give way to useless alarm , added he , though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain .	6.605461259427686
but Collins , after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will , and should never resent her behaviour as any affront , seated himself at another table with Bennet , and prepared for backgammon .	4.660124468856093
A younger son , you know , must be inured to self-denial and dependence .	32.029120313383444
We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word .	30.594221918342736
Yes , or I will never see her again .	95.7607880215297
You have shewn him off now much more than he did himself .	43.087360119128725
From what we have seen of him , continued Gardiner , I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body , as he has done by poor Wickham .	4.8181288576679195
She had known , it seems , of their being in love with each other , many weeks .	19.51809262824388
I have , Very well .	471.8840345196738
Through letters , whatever of good or bad was to be told , would be communicated , and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance .	7.060829867358011
It is fortunate , then , that they fall to my lot instead of to yours .	21.72220572838356
Tell him what a dreadful state I am in , that I am frightened out of my wits ;	18.269035303836148
The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings dreadful .	182.92503594593404
Because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement .	43.035708093730584
She could not bear such suspense ;	284.198606205791
And quite alone ?	1852.6301645352398
Nor did that day wear out her resentment .	126.55438690341512
In ran Bennet to her daughter's room , in her dressing gown , and with her hair half finished , crying out , My dear Jane , make haste and hurry down .	6.229387299101683
what does he say ?	938.781210914611
sir , I do indeed .	471.56144177488665
Is it true ?	1856.6325935061382
They could not be untouched by his politeness , and had they drawn his character from their own feelings , and his servant's report , without any reference to any other account , the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known , would not have recognised it for Darcy .	3.3510835419244405
but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right .	55.9342333214968
What made you so shy of me , when you first called , and afterwards dined here ?	18.999945744396776
If it was not allowable for him to gain my affections , because I had no money , what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about , and who was equally poor ?	4.508354507414429
and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me .	53.697061873635356
Till this moment , I never knew myself .	126.55438690341512
She looked forward to their entrance , as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend .	11.254025729163795
He was not seated by her ;	282.62554140837
a respectable-looking , elderly woman , much less fine , and more civil , than she had any notion of finding her .	11.815369030548771
but Elizabeth , less clear-sighted perhaps in his case than in Charlotte's , did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence .	10.34212733422608
who should do it but her own uncle ?	126.49047972269389
She respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his welfare ;	13.890291963768158
He is a sweet tempered , amiable , charming man .	68.9573881128541
I want to know , said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister's , what you have learnt about Wickham .	10.691842898647844
Such a disappointment !	1870.258437069029
It is often only carelessness of opinion , and sometimes an indirect boast .	35.31783030740159
I have just had a letter from Jane , with such dreadful news .	37.99244725139895
Her heart did whisper , that he had done it for her .	49.84393627748457
Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet's general habits , she was absolutely incredulous here .	22.438520913612777
we will ask you no questions .	283.79608068693244
It was dated from Rosings , at eight o'clock in the morning , and was as follows : Be not alarmed , Madam , on receiving this letter , by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments , or renewal of those offers , which were last night so disgusting to you .	3.1402394603342163
Her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating .	43.046570027904586
When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen , they returned down stairs , and taking leave of the housekeeper , were consigned over to the gardener , who met them at the hall door .	4.224554937399052
cried Gardiner , whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive .	26.00264443772622
made no mention of the business that had taken him away , and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it .	9.485722744307125
for he was discovered to be proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased ;	16.849868710091194
Every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world ;	39.586043321345606
A few days after this visit , Bingley called again , and alone .	35.318018276957545
Elizabeth was determined ;	1854.592280176145
and then was enraged against herself for being so silly !	72.03259439564225
I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly .	68.94898494931847
Wickham , Lydia , were all forgotten .	183.14020738124086
Oh !	8965.45062507954
But it is fortunate , thought she , that I have something to wish for .	28.41984462058022
He has been here this half hour , and master has had a letter .	29.58247780580774
our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered ;	182.9046321206164
But I cannot I have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly .	15.01511112173225
Charlotte had hardly time to answer , before they were joined by Kitty , who came to tell the same news , and no sooner had they entered the breakfast-room , where Bennet was alone , than she likewise began on the subject , calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion , and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family .	2.623097377090064
I have not forgot , you see ;	183.47123937385913
and during part of that time , Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Bingley , who came from the dance for a few minutes , to press his friend to join it .	4.453362913351017
cried Elizabeth , when she had finished .	223.22411547360278
But every line proved more clearly that the affair , which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent , as to render Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous , was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole .	3.642027331814372
and had any thing of the kind been perceptible , you must be aware that ours is not a family , on which it could be thrown away .	7.99270408384324
Bennet , to whose apartment they all repaired , after a few minutes conversation together , received them exactly as might be expected ;	10.743281065564464
and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air , with such a companion .	13.464734147601748
Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening .	6.1641053652632385
for , if I recollect right , he went but the day before .	35.41312437381465
The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire , you must know , was at a ball and at this ball , what do you think he did ?	7.041473490211092
the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me .	19.589568370386274
I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not .	26.00769149887723
Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now .	37.44324157570224
It has often led him to be liberal and generous , to give his money freely , to display hospitality , to assist his tenants , and relieve the poor .	6.570091906541682
The discussion of Collins's offer was now nearly at an end , and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother .	5.304547167247895
and her invitation was accepted with alacrity .	183.2702869064239
On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn ;	68.91980248528974
Sir William Lucas , and his daughter Maria , a good humoured girl , but as empty-headed as himself , had nothing to say that could be worth hearing , and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise .	3.8813523760556907
CHAPTER I Miss Bingley's letter arrived , and put an end to doubt .	38.810716092489905
Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph 1 .	29.634925244752036
and by a manoeuvre of Bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone , which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family .	4.42007837234941
I know your disposition , Lizzy .	282.74932142875343
When the clock struck three , Elizabeth felt that she must go ;	45.843631808938234
And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth !	29.546424213635913
And I certainly never shall give it .	184.02289964922286
but we will hope at some future period , to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known , and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence .	4.424669995438589
But I have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected .	30.59934907524739
Young ladies of her age , are sometimes a little difficult to manage , and if she has the true Darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way .	6.352894638890469
to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before Collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery .	4.380896972729012
How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Darcy , for now they do appear wholly undeserved .	9.087957195596688
I understand that Collins has made you an offer of marriage .	57.28193312480278
Such was Miss Lucas's scheme ;	472.6522511706156
and she coloured at the idea ;	282.50396966655677
This room was my late master's favourite room , and these miniatures are just as they used to be then .	13.52755884011767
You promised me to insist upon her marrying him .	91.33817008208028
and I am sure if I had been you , I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it .	11.330615543211747
At length , however , the question was asked by her uncle ;	44.95564226469372
Darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours .	53.713240977281366
She wished to discredit it entirely , repeatedly exclaiming , This must be false !	29.54427158604398
for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though George Wickham has treated Darcy in a most infamous manner .	8.810125770240303
This letter gave Elizabeth some pain ;	282.4720197126427
In marrying your nephew , I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere .	33.71669303922799
I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading !	68.87691576261868
I hope your plans in favour of the shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood .	15.024799247673794
I cannot misunderstand you , but I intreat you , dear Lizzy , not to pain me by thinking that person to blame , and saying your opinion of him is sunk .	6.1652655441701
Miss Bennet , I insist on being satisfied .	132.8563003668909
Oh !	8965.45062507954
Yes , she did .	874.3364164695123
How odious I should think them !	282.45680254758156
and if he had the fortune he ought to have , I should think you could not do better .	15.693363618530364
Unless where they like women of fortune , which I think they very often do .	25.14344703474128
CHAPTER IV .	4138.577761074046
She soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt , who did call on him in her return through London , and there relate her journey to Longbourn , its motive , and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth ;	3.5128863871114673
but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her .	53.69947538206595
My sole dependence was on you ;	282.4074691992821
My fingers wait your orders .	471.7187122003186
As for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin Elizabeth .	4.994192112431555
Certainly .	16016.01284449929
who can it be ?	876.7604997548386
and much as she had always been disposed to like him , she could not think without anger , hardly without contempt , on that easiness of temper , that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends , and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations .	2.992332244809643
Since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and expedite a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with Wickham , he easily learnt , had never been his design .	4.797647931916351
and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of or I may say , three very silly sisters .	11.244849277498039
you are a great deal too apt you know , to like people in general .	26.95733737633552
Before any answer could arrive from Collins , or any congratulations to Elizabeth , from his wife , the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas lodge .	6.234989219486308
His words seemed to imply it .	282.44437404839834
Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment , after such an affront to Colonel Forster ?	17.37922520903913
and Collins was to attend them , at the request of Bennet , who was most anxious to get rid of him , and have his library to himself ;	7.445113207968419
While thus engaged , Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ;	5.782636867268202
Perhaps there was some truth in this ;	183.16570495715496
was it so ?	1867.8877100436616
I am glad of one thing , that he comes alone ;	56.148813601614506
He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before ;	29.54490876701647
She got up , and ran out of the room ;	81.23152581164815
There are a lot of things you can do with Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works .	6.763800180113712
Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution ;	183.07689607753127
when he spoke , his accent had none of its usual sedateness ;	43.13239398564218
The darling wish of his sisters was then gratified ;	91.33489401897373
You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper .	43.40800041010117
She had been watching him the last hour , she said , as he walked up and down the street , and had Wickham appeared Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation , but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers , who in comparison with the stranger , were become stupid , disagreeable fellows .	2.8274818756353155
Money !	15895.509420740158
This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening , in summer ;	30.594035121217736
At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal , if he had not been well assured of his cousin's corroboration .	3.3660289054983252
Ah !	13586.708929614973
The paling of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side .	53.69991330566006
But I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed .	17.301887747461237
1 .	10898.860396037358
she was aware that no one liked him but Jane ;	68.91482029193998
Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight ;	69.03007866997895
and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last .	13.894674441262165
I defy even Sir William Lucas himself , to produce a more valuable son-in-law .	30.585138613205924
and not a day went by without a solitary walk , in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections .	10.330204698592768
and Elizabeth began to like them herself , when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for Jane .	13.898061158321672
The gentlemen came ;	1852.3706106999628
I have seen them both .	502.5758862141584
I beg your pardon .	903.9144660650614
But there were other causes of repugnance ;	183.66692947102797
This , madam , is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together ;	17.29938380621334
and yet how many things have happened !	183.79423355839037
I only fear that the sort of cautiousness , to which you , I imagine , have been alluding , is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe .	4.3504782445385235
The one missent must be first attended to ;	126.09045440218053
and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia's connections , which is not likely , can I suppose her so lost to every thing ?	6.68201514811517
and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind .	7.330845890668018
and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal .	10.580087807533852
To the little town of Lambton , the scene of Gardiner's former residence , and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained , they bent their steps , after having seen all the principal wonders of the country ;	4.351091659013266
yet she received them with tolerable ease , and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment , or any unnecessary complaisance .	8.741562952191735
Come here , child , cried her father as she appeared .	53.89319422157084
Bingley , she had likewise seen for an instant , and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed .	11.513822664569647
They were , therefore , to go .	203.77836858141657
That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask .	56.001210191430665
I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere .	53.811464535279
What are you telling Miss Bennet ?	282.4502899266855
It seems an hopeless business .	471.6296704665073
I hate such false friends .	471.5869008114699
He is come Bingley is come .	282.77503918561143
and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual , and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation .	7.329384238667679
I am not qualified to form one .	183.2924792757897
Yes , Ma'am , all .	472.33838790183415
She liked him too little to care for his approbation .	68.8797573713175
Oh !	8965.45062507954
CHAPTER VI .	4138.577761074046
I think not .	1858.9335896672112
and then added , May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left and Collins well .	15.446091261791924
My dear Jane , I am in such a flutter , that I am sure I can't write ;	21.669491845569116
Where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant , distance becomes no evil .	21.791135352191375
She asked her at different times , how many sisters she had , whether they were older or younger than herself , whether any of them were likely to be married , whether they were handsome , where they had been educated , what carriage her father kept , and what had been her mother's maiden name ?	3.0279707680460617
We can all plague and punish one another .	126.13623838786818
At length Darcy spoke , and in a constrained manner said , Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them , is less certain .	4.875870503449264
E1 .	14526.116811011168
Towards him I have been kinder than towards myself .	91.32606463305149
Indeed , Darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire and , give me leave to say , very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate , and such things may come out , as will shock your relations to hear .	3.210291094552118
Could she exert herself it would be better , but this is not to be expected ;	24.356800838963196
A glass of wine ;	873.3594448530172
She performed her part indeed without much graciousness , but Bennet was satisfied , and soon afterwards ordered her carriage .	13.524876173483122
That is as it happens .	472.4907099354028
Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself , that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking , which ceased when he saw her no more ;	4.686705569910605
Maria would tell her nothing more , and down they ran into the dining-room , which fronted the lane , in quest of this wonder ;	9.086267556378813
Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly .	182.9046321206164
But , my dear sister , can I be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere ?	6.427202752189579
All young ladies accomplished !	874.8220436768123
Yes , vanity is a weakness indeed .	183.15959188304265
Elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again , she wanted Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her .	11.6169256758411
but whether always charming , it is not for me to determine .	48.912082240425356
In short , I will do my best .	126.11576719060714
Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday ;	472.0964291441105
Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them ;	126.8718664103748
But this idea was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw Darcy walk into the room .	7.371126549928179
And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley .	31.66707338501475
till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of Bingley , and her being the sister of Jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding , made every body eager for another , to supply the idea .	3.9644235038780953
Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service .	4.065125063496535
Are they indeed ?	1857.7298224708
And then , with a slight bow , turned again into the plantation , and was soon out of sight .	13.932017508092171
CHAPTER VIII .	4353.740372381362
She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do ;	4.8337326975320725
I will take care of myself , and of Wickham too .	55.98695206893009
He addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet , with a polite congratulation ;	46.485487733442746
Between the two eldest and herself especially , there subsisted a very particular regard .	29.54241929447434
She was afraid of talking longer of his friend ;	91.37862023424724
I did not think you would ;	290.6383723182091
and as a punishment for him , as well as a possible advantage to Jane , she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Darcy's sister , as , by Wickham's account , she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away .	4.085245515628777
Take whatever you like , and get away .	126.07739456675078
Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year , which , unfortunately for his daughters , was entailed in default of heirs male , on a distant relation ;	5.84652067881838
That he is as false and deceitful , as he is insinuating .	43.16070656254505
The whist party soon afterwards breaking up , the players gathered round the other table , and Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Philips .	7.78392267918338
Oxford , Blenheim , Warwick , Kenelworth , Birmingham , c .	53.69533281330631
The envelope itself was likewise full .	282.3552787512534
Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it ;	29.666615595684217
CHAPTER XV .	4138.577761074046
and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well .	37.425338580189454
cried Lydia .	4356.758471927727
The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit , and the result of it was , that the youngest should tax Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield .	4.044758362762598
You make me laugh , Charlotte ;	282.36793845088044
Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk ;	91.50792920719019
Did Charlotte dine with you ?	472.84243660369384
for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort springs from a breach of promise , for I ought not to have mentioned the subject ?	8.482150362917633
And till Colonel Forster came himself , not one of you entertained a doubt , I suppose , of their being really married ?	11.654774630628715
They had several children .	875.9050051101752
But of every other neglect I can believe him capable .	69.20977078793243
and to complete the view , she saw herself seated beneath a tent , tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once .	10.352502074404361
I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance .	29.565824374580167
and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my cards .	22.13296541915306
While in their cradles , we planned the union : and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished , in their marriage , to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly unallied to the family !	3.272709739179539
It is not quite a week since they left Brighton .	69.10125435923972
I should not mind any thing at all .	126.2701280889995
You were Bingley's first choice .	471.6466798211467
I cannot see why Forster should not ask me as well as Lydia , said she , though I am not her particular friend .	10.94757334243874
Bingley was punctual to his appointment ;	300.2525095051769
my dear , dear Jane , I am so happy !	77.71326726341823
and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once .	20.916933480528613
So , do not put yourself to inconvenience .	126.49047972269389
And so , I suppose , they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead .	21.82777945614177
How I long to see her again !	188.78294110131947
To Pemberley , therefore , they were to go .	102.9628474683592
You have widely mistaken my character , if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these .	13.53545933232586
Here are officers enough at Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country .	26.10287106822224
But on the following morning , every hope of this kind was done away .	29.544193728906308
He was silent .	1854.7350382526906
cried Wickham with a look which did not escape her .	68.92806977561507
I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's connections .	91.57595792773793
Well , if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own , so much the better .	12.32607243454404
Lady Catherine seemed resigned .	874.7388730060378
Your great men often are ;	471.9878147802151
He declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister's attachment ;	43.03973758073568
My dearest Lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Darcy , to be treating his father's favourite in such a manner , one , whom his father had promised to provide for .	5.12667288378015
Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks , online payments and credit card donations .	16.80241529948447
a report which highly incensed Bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood .	15.033446824054502
Do let me ask my partner to introduce you .	91.3923814333069
and while she steadily repressed it , could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing , that however long , and for whatever cause , his attentions had been withdrawn , her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal .	3.5537883881505032
my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken .	91.49335049213222
The next was in these words .	284.1617085306268
Her ladyship was highly incensed .	471.7562158696961
To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate !	53.718143523166326
In this perturbed state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on ;	16.849238994096783
but , though she always kept a very good table , she did not think any thing less than two courses , could be good enough for a man , on whom she had such anxious designs , or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a-year .	3.322047572804309
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him ;	26.541991509847538
he has some friends , though perhaps not so many as he deserves .	35.32832490539429
They will ruin your happiness .	474.39387828604356
and at the age of twenty-seven , without having ever been handsome , she felt all the good luck of it .	12.815915171720544
From what I can collect , he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them .	8.320385338105657
Could she have seen half as much love in Darcy for herself , she would have ordered her wedding clothes .	14.287072085383205
The horses were post ;	872.8811074345388
Well , and what news does it bring ?	126.28721896735865
Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning , and writing to Jane , while Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village , when she was startled by a ring at the door , the certain signal of a visitor .	4.347056411399033
Thoughtlessness , want of attention to other people's feelings , and want of resolution , will do the business .	15.431141229468379
There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended ;	35.316036812196806
You doubt me , cried Jane , slightly colouring ;	91.33817008208028
The possibility of meeting Darcy , while viewing the place , instantly occurred .	35.307836105462044
No , that I am sure I shall not ;	118.57877160916854
and she made the most of the time , by visiting about with her daughter , and having very frequent parties at home .	10.73172447726953
But she had chosen it with her eyes open ;	91.5796661097815
He is nothing to us , you know , and I am sure I never want to see him again .	17.366358280886175
Lydia does not leave me because she is married ;	91.48093663627992
My love , should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much ?	16.804983463225486
Another intreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the desired effect ;	30.584230460984017
We have tried two or three subjects already without success , and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine .	11.247253221699124
Of course , we hope that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work .	4.064823024364168
and the girls smiled on each other .	183.070627665587
and if she were married to him to-morrow , I should think she had as good a chance of happiness , as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth .	6.064210572456961
Your humility , Bingley , said Elizabeth , must disarm reproof .	68.55420056803337
How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own daughters I cannot understand ;	15.012636821874995
and her features are not at all handsome .	132.72256596488364
You observed it , Darcy , I am sure , said Miss Bingley ;	45.64719132752493
I know you will do him such ample justice , that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent .	14.585451605647256
It cannot last long .	879.5991550186795
no , no , this is not likely .	132.91071129505102
If he had another motive , I am sure it would never disgrace him .	35.96538652577186
Well , well , I only hope it will last .	68.97464510774202
In a fortnight they were to go , and once gone , she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account .	9.42441216985811
I appeal to Darcy : but let me not interrupt you , You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady , whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me .	5.0143950859957265
And for this we are to be thankful .	132.50231607497776
Miss Bennet still looked all amazement .	283.26528082925864
She became jealous of his esteem , when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it .	17.295667286611558
but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming , she had no wish of her recovering immediately , as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield .	5.838797107361326
I was given good principles , but left to follow them in pride and conceit .	25.162418086196375
for though I am the youngest , I'm the tallest .	69.16633789202615
You are over scrupulous surely .	472.2019723359574
and she turned away with alarm , while Reynolds replied , that he was , adding , but we expect him to-morrow , with a large party of friends .	7.64461399257797
yes .	14480.258232335662
I thank you , again and again , for not going to the Lakes .	30.820098735706072
I know them a little .	472.3416687974057
and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send .	53.7718520597076
How could you begin ?	877.2660169404152
But I am at his disposal .	284.02993270571574
There was no help for it however .	183.26327021368118
Thank God !	4775.128987276426
It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth ;	43.05067172103819
oh !	15895.509420740158
what's his name .	1852.072171128788
and the pleasure of being with Charlotte , and the kind attentions she had received , must make her feel the obliged .	11.975472056007808
Well girls , said she , as soon as they were left to themselves , What say you to the day ?	15.621523849829067
Why should they not go on to Scotland , if that had been the case ?	25.165658020998052
All that I can promise you , therefore , is not to be in a hurry .	23.89383059341358
My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly , to try to discover her .	21.759001427851217
I wish I could say any thing to comfort you , replied Elizabeth ;	35.57715927084564
But you know married women have never much time for writing .	53.81338716517671
it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited ;	43.110714728308096
And you saw the old housekeeper , I suppose ?	91.72413178075286
but Wickham was as far beyond them all in person , countenance , air , and walk , as they were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips , breathing port wine , who followed them into the room .	4.614736765392597
It was consoling , that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush .	13.892965359841844
Of his former way of life , nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself .	16.82021824649305
there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her , and though by no means so clever as herself , she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her's , he might become a very agreeable companion .	3.8602145645694437
he replied , and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled .	23.140978615044084
but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless .	68.99828312421735
But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment .	11.021539591952514
But I will not torment you with vain wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks .	15.06114465253009
but such of us as wished to learn , never wanted the means .	35.307578478466574
Yes , Sir ;	1855.8024402471776
In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else , and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room .	8.908543022166958
Bingley urged Jones's being sent for immediately ;	183.04061355825843
though it was some time , I confess , before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice .	18.17532961823413
and from such as had been already visible below , she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcy's , in crayons , whose subjects were usually more interesting , and also more intelligible .	4.9135700386703896
I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies .	48.307542806307424
The whole party before them , indeed , excited a lively attention .	43.18894381471375
I shall be back by dinner .	282.7107519277388
and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do .	10.336811942681193
You cannot have been always at Longbourn .	184.0126658638494
Well , my dear , said he , when she ceased speaking , I have no more to say .	19.697766287705765
and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view , as he meant to chuse one of the daughters , if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report .	4.225609241806758
you mean Jane , I suppose because he danced with her twice .	45.939061504495406
Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor .	68.94642586571153
Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here ;	71.97872119944574
Ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either , detection could not be in your power , and suspicion certainly not in your inclination .	8.480783439916722
Not handsome enough to dance with !	299.39879393128234
Elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak ;	15.010376487307752
How Darcy looked , therefore , she could not tell .	89.69037419753936
Elizabeth was pleased , though , when she asked herself the reason , she had very little to say in reply .	12.472055871534012
Impossible , Bennet , impossible , when I am not acquainted with him myself ;	30.584230460984017
I told him , moreover , that I believed myself mistaken in supposing , as I had done , that your sister was indifferent to him ;	8.315444269383686
and still thought there might have been time enough .	91.32939756883732
I shall not be able to keep you and so I warn you .	40.04949399779548
My dear , dear Lydia !	445.5499665766152
It was owing to him , to his reserve , and want of proper consideration , that Wickham's character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was .	5.233648176014606
It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened .	16.125401707736966
Such a countenance , such manners !	284.39778980154114
Lydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself .	11.259149944453148
I know very well , madam , said he , that when persons sit down to a card table , they must take their chance of these things , and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object .	4.315443670573012
While there was an officer in Meryton , they would flirt with him ;	35.36063440189834
they were dances of mortification .	473.5287383739997
CHAPTER XIII .	4138.577761074046
and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time .	26.03731591210142
That is very true , said Elizabeth ;	194.38417363327952
But it was not to be .	338.1922896259804
Elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced ;	91.33824067289287
She was going to the butcher's , she told me , on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday , and she has got three couple of ducks , just fit to be killed .	5.305476122863775
she replied , endeavouring to recover herself .	183.03688621994775
The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time , and the plan became perfect as plan could be .	11.229000596766417
It is enough to know they are discovered , I have seen them both Then it is , as I always hoped , cried Jane ;	9.503913189526736
Only this ;	4780.899232567606
You judge very properly , said Bennet , and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy .	11.930118487712548
But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule .	12.61155030532291
I was only confused for the moment , because I felt that I should be looked at .	20.189443171507467
She began at length to recover , to fidget about in her chair , get up , sit down again , wonder , and bless herself .	8.299382951239055
her eldest daughter , she must just mention she felt it incumbent on her to hint , was likely to be very soon engaged .	10.026084526426809
No , I believe not .	472.6472140406859
VOL .	13586.708929614973
for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone .	35.314725858483484
The far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances .	25.988999948091063
but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts , fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one , with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance .	4.015622135834484
Pray write instantly , and let me understand it unless it is , for very cogent reasons , to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary ;	6.928839232676184
The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard , his claims on Darcy , and all that he had suffered from him , was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed ;	6.699590160749554
But when Elizabeth told of his silence , it did not seem very likely , even to Charlotte's wishes , to be the case ;	9.926669661570102
Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well-bred man , and talked very pleasantly ;	13.57004634551825
Into one house in this neighbourhood , they shall never have admittance .	44.72525668522279
But with me , it is not so .	141.44933761713756
Nor was it under many , many minutes , that she could comprehend what she heard ;	23.183506821639227
It drew from her , however , the exertion of speaking , which nothing else had so effectually done before ;	14.265765750703205
Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied , Yes , you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that .	11.229221013576657
Her air was not conciliating , nor was her manner of receiving them , such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank .	10.009947456054492
When those dances were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by Darcy , who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him .	3.4533404838179145
She was very equal therefore to address Bingley on the subject of the ball , and abruptly reminded him of his promise ;	12.372450401243167
Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning ;	35.42809685480058
When dinner was over , she returned directly to Jane , and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room .	9.63904618062057
This young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way , with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire , splendid property , noble kindred , and extensive patronage .	6.561328953446514
Kitty is slight and delicate , and Mary studies so much , that her hours of repose should not be broken in on .	10.590780383835211
But I have always observed , that they who are good-natured when children , are good-natured when they grow up ;	13.529366215689468
but she still thought him partial to Jane , and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend's permission , or being bold enough to come without it .	5.532590642473906
You must send John with the young ladies , Collins .	75.20445979583909
Pray read on .	1858.8109328538897
CHAPTER XI .	4353.740372381362
but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it , and making her sister the excuse , said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book .	5.435472066806076
but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal ;	43.22520486171446
But we must stem the tide of malice , and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other , the balm of sisterly consolation .	9.80521119391176
the happiest , wisest , most reasonable end !	126.2147580117531
At that instant she felt , that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends , for moments of such painful confusion .	9.584247135968177
Not like the wild young men now-a-days , who think of nothing but themselves .	30.602015298416397
I believe she did and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object .	15.410851688242598
and Wickham , who happened to sit near Elizabeth , began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood , with a good humoured ease , which she felt very unable to equal in her replies .	5.304430376196516
and by her connivance and aid , he so far recommended himself to Georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement .	3.698945255104557
How much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book !	43.19929588565958
Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Darcy .	126.09540457175159
it cannot be .	1854.2451598500725
His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own ;	35.314872211487874
he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield , and she blushed as she answered , I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family .	5.2017838855239855
The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter , and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country .	4.073165771532066
What he means to do , I am sure I know not ;	57.33360059930427
Generous , good man , I am afraid he has distressed himself .	48.30594905733311
His doing so drew her notice .	282.44437404839834
The consequence of it is , that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have , and that Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever .	7.202356231825124
Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word .	91.40060461645092
Gardiner left them soon after breakfast .	282.6147487674214
To Darcy it was welcome intelligence Elizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough .	35.31856060239264
I knew how it would be I knew he would manage every thing .	36.14454865333188
a father absent , a mother incapable of exertion , and requiring constant attendance ;	29.602146744580267
It was then disclosed in the following manner .	132.53588545258788
Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay , as they had been at first .	13.129262691459187
I need not explain myself farther ;	282.33513186395595
his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do .	26.031959016207633
Indeed you must go , for it will be impossible for us to visit him , if you do not .	15.930478629949762
Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends , that could materially lessen its weight .	15.009175861060113
and her uncle and aunt , leaving her to enjoy them in quiet , set off by themselves .	18.899618783643188
Well , he is a very undeserving young man and I do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now .	8.147778950590794
and now , I hope you are satisfied .	142.21801609432953
III .	15895.509420740158
In a doleful voice Bennet thus began the projected conversation .	69.02130998827866
But these , I suppose , are precisely what you are without .	49.17145792240701
She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love , rather than by his ;	5.3963954557892295
for a few minutes he was silent ;	214.71651832742154
It is a long time , Bingley , since you went away , said Bennet .	26.90621875342545
no one was to be put in competition with him .	69.07177390249686
One has got all the goodness , and the other all the appearance of it .	28.338842390821966
the eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt , there cannot be two opinions on that point .	22.426074990501558
She answered him in the usual way , and after a moment's pause , added , My eldest sister has been in town these three months .	8.798358367784262
and Lady Lucas , who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken .	6.228778661021081
It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man .	9.558642298955522
Elizabeth , as she affectionately embraced her , whilst tears filled the eyes of both , lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives .	6.356259302672012
Long before it had taken place , my opinion of you was decided .	36.616905525906006
Dear , dear Lizzy .	872.7545377705296
But I can assure you , she added , that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy ;	15.08698334907729
When , after examining the mother , in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Darcy , she turned her eyes on the daughter , she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment , at her being so thin , and so small .	3.806923615464007
The conduct of neither , if strictly examined , will be irreproachable ;	43.03917530227505
My mind was more agreeably engaged .	282.4074691992821
She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances , and she was in no humour to indulge him .	10.052473768188264
He had certainly formed such a plan , and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend .	4.10778401235868
True ;	16070.241809748964
whenever she was alone , she gave way to it as the greatest relief ;	29.54241929447434
The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner , and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank such affability and condescension , as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine .	3.752226888419214
And pray , Lizzy , what said Lady Catherine about this report ?	43.04219051738933
By the Author of Sense and Sensibility .	168.36914182367553
But of all the views which his garden , or which the country , or the kingdom could boast , none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings , afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house .	3.473719137490176
No thanks to his gallantry for that .	183.01310093230205
and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see Darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea .	4.911041483372746
Bennet , with great civility , begged her ladyship to take some refreshment ;	35.37764701735918
An unhappy alternative is before you , Elizabeth .	126.49047972269389
and while Darcy was attending them to their carriage , Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth's person , behaviour , and dress .	8.497516454725275
Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted ?	91.49335049213222
I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband ;	19.010438046387655
Believe her to be deceived by all means .	126.07739456675078
and though more astonished than gratified herself , by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her .	5.015687189083496
for she received an invitation from Forster , the wife of the Colonel of the regiment , to accompany her to Brighton .	11.537707325511922
It is almost past belief .	471.8542217062196
LIMITED WARRANTY , DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the Right of Replacement or Refund described in paragraph 1 .	15.046762596124418
The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements , with such news as the country afforded ;	13.524978223492045
Imagine our surprise .	1852.072171128788
but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded .	56.26485504187547
Good gracious !	4123.65795852664
and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world .	16.873089498958443
A low phaeton , with a nice little pair of ponies , would be the very thing .	19.001136351647286
Your coming to Longbourn , to see me and my family , said Elizabeth , coolly , will be rather a confirmation of it ;	10.580721053338136
I am ashamed of you !	471.7276213149332
He is rich , to be sure , and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane .	15.256023903454755
Miss Darcy , though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations , readily obeyed .	14.622364992047725
he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire , and Jane and Elizabeth , in addition to every other source of happiness , were within thirty miles of each other .	6.345429588867293
That he was surprised by the connexion was evident ;	91.64446807658962
A clear ten thousand per annum .	282.48421472310156
My dear Bennet , you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother .	15.111100451246596
This is the only point , I flatter myself , on which we do not agree .	21.746902825395747
Four nieces of Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means ;	53.93759540895025
Till I can forget his father , I can never defy or expose him .	29.620613063249884
But now several minutes elapsed , without bringing the sound of his voice ;	35.39257666708224
had I known what I ought , what I dared , to do !	35.3051414270065
that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance !	69.27361597951204
Her power was sinking ;	873.1510774730008
1 .	10898.860396037358
and perhaps he might be doing the same .	126.08232441121416
Yes , he had no engagement at all for to-morrow ;	68.95235514298605
When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night , she followed her , and made the important communication .	14.111404764478845
Yes , very indifferent indeed , said Elizabeth , laughingly .	83.4041787705842
Miss Elizabeth Bennet !	1853.5905972651756
Elizabeth most thankfully consented , and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay , and bring back a supply of clothes .	7.94928133529605
Gardiner declared his willingness , and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation .	38.45129232751467
CHAPTER XIV .	4138.577761074046
I have no such injuries to resent .	184.0910198855359
but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion , suffered no variation of colour .	21.746236807715075
Oh , Lydia !	1856.8414363661354
But now it was all too natural .	183.56704921030865
but he seemed to like his second better .	126.3366823180881
My dear sir , replied Collins , I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship's concurrence .	5.785991651758703
make haste , my love .	471.56144177488665
and he thought it an excellent one , full of eligibility and suitableness , and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part .	10.336811942681193
He enquired in a friendly , though general way , after her family , and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done .	7.3280731524598774
and why not to me ?	471.58490955147676
If he fears me , why come hither ?	126.34267780511186
That will make thirteen with ourselves , so there will be just room at table for him .	19.000708369689864
Oh !	8965.45062507954
there were half hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte , and the weather was so fine for the time of year , that she had often great enjoyment out of doors .	6.800844446551643
Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form , he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing ;	6.239616793676397
No officer is ever to enter my house again , nor even to pass through the village .	19.001779557345106
Bennet , in short , was in very great spirits ;	75.29122633827856
As a child I was taught what was right , but I was not taught to correct my temper .	15.48292127696635
he drew back his chair , took a newspaper from the table , and , glancing over it , said , in a colder voice , Are you pleased with Kent ?	6.425061272399981
And there are several of the young men , too , that she likes very much .	22.491403611412434
You are then resolved to have him ?	183.11483092893872
Wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates ;	11.516730879603909
You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I hope , though you have but a short lease .	13.578393568969753
They met again on Sunday , and then I saw him too .	45.7526673422561
and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition .	16.797851683213864
You will not be fit to be seen when you get there .	43.284914796683076
The period of expectation was now doubled .	182.92503594593404
Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject .	25.173357876049234
I am going away myself .	475.0209196360514
that is rather singular .	874.1480634493184
But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed ;	102.92153938337192
It was an encouragement of vice ;	282.4684183941842
Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so , said Collins very gravely but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you .	7.80165196183943
I leave it to yourself to determine , said Bennet .	68.87691576261868
Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the expression of heart-felt delight , diffused over his face , became him ;	7.68621716534722
No .	15913.020394745017
Now , Lizzy , I think I have surprised you .	82.11292220221604
she repeated .	4749.252455870382
Upon my word , said her Ladyship , you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person .	15.12378210418867
I certainly saw Darcy speaking to her .	183.99293104160637
He did not leave his name , and till the next day , it was only known that a gentleman had called on business .	10.239117206370862
If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other , or ever so similar before-hand , it does not advance their felicity in the least .	6.818467194950576
I see what you are feeling , replied Charlotte , you must be surprised , very much surprised , so lately as Collins was wishing to marry you .	7.7385812982592475
But are you pleased , Jane ?	282.34942266949554
do any thing rather than marry without affection .	133.20279826019544
CHAPTER XIX .	4138.577761074046
Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his countenance .	43.09231672642542
Certainly , my dear , nobody said there were ;	111.52587278831686
You know my sentiments .	875.7860848562314
that the young man's marrying her , was a patched-up business , at the expence of your father and uncles .	14.116585522330597
In the intervals of her discourse with Collins , she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth , but especially to the latter , of whose connections she knew the least , and who she observed to Collins , was a very genteel , pretty kind of girl .	3.4796201980082775
She talked to Elizabeth again and again ;	182.92227550805146
Miss Bennet had slept ill , and though up , was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room .	12.298827490368812
Lady Catherine it appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings , for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Darcy .	7.3326061853148055
How are you all ?	873.2577452231428
How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning , Darcy , she cried ;	35.31585366000564
I should say , one of her ladyship's carriages , for she has several .	30.616950672285594
and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time .	29.59155143711971
How grievous then was the thought that , of a situation so desirable in every respect , so replete with advantage , so promising for happiness , Jane had been deprived , by the folly and indecorum of her own family !	4.350956843488275
for though dilatory in undertaking business , he was quick in its execution .	35.43113620852704
and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet .	11.482770057413594
and if a smart young colonel , with five or six thousand a year , should want one of my girls , I shall not say nay to him ;	7.521696000412195
and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance .	30.613437062418086
I send no compliments to your mother .	182.9129876873433
I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow .	9.575723432342878
Your younger sisters must be very young ?	183.04455710092327
It was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for Longbourn , before she told her sister of Darcy's proposals .	10.345120877376408
Collins , awkward and solemn , apologising instead of attending , and often moving wrong without being aware of it , gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give .	4.578822329512499
But , though this might be imaginary , she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy , who had been set up as a rival of Jane .	7.521901699951001
Now , Kitty , you may cough as much as you chuse , said Bennet ;	26.910992841882052
No , indeed .	1857.2855533423947
All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over .	91.4702385855301
Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy .	55.92991835555153
and then , unwilling to let the subject drop , added , He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire , I understand .	8.89229843331082
Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father , their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility .	8.670442322490207
and if she would give him leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them .	19.071812761161425
I should be sorry , you know , to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire .	13.589476806241132
And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry ?	91.34257250110858
But it must not , shall not be .	132.71213421581578
and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park , hurried home with the great intelligence .	15.029142009417
After abusing you so abominably to your face , I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations .	12.285545398627027
Lizzy , said he , I was going to look for you ;	48.81317118170004
cried Elizabeth , darting from her seat as she finished the letter , in eagerness to follow him , without losing a moment of the time so precious ;	7.501727256539712
Her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction ;	6.560988494724296
From the farther disadvantage of Lydia's society she was of course carefully kept , and though Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her , with the promise of balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going .	3.8816234673538186
I do not at all know ;	282.8563743308561
Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield and looked in vain for Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her .	5.684124892781981
Good Heaven !	4369.663431489112
After playing some Italian songs , Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air ;	21.72621569355413
and when I next write to her , I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account .	15.019553922061403
Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought , said Bennet ;	30.629897637162607
and with many men , I dare say , it succeeds .	62.92518943211025
Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency .	91.36058509390475
Will you be very angry with me , my dear Lizzy , if I take this opportunity of saying ( what I was never bold enough to say before ) how much I like him .	5.685793280350234
and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend .	15.055520855686378
I am glad I bought my bonnet , if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox !	15.049095474856015
That the wish of giving happiness to you , might add force to the other inducements which led me on , I shall not attempt to deny .	8.219476072646254
and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment ;	107.96720734871812
but she , who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible , gaily continued , Oh !	11.684643221589258
Surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement .	68.87435935390347
and in spite of his being a lover , Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity , to be rationally founded , because they had for basis the excellent understanding , and super-excellent disposition of Jane , and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself .	3.403004335221781
CHAPTER XXIII .	4747.787542098787
On the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband .	25.195272328443515
And who is there , whatever might be their former conduct , that she would believe capable of such an attempt , till it were proved against them ?	7.5689542023845435
It was an earnest , steadfast gaze , but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind .	7.062092367599242
I will only add , God bless you .	126.23352695724233
of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance !	182.9046321206164
Wickham , perhaps , is my favourite ;	183.14020738124086
and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage , she may have less trouble in achieving a second ;	5.436349461407621
Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder , and when at last Collins allowed him time to speak , replied with an air of distant civility .	8.985611260700479
But , my dear , your father cannot spare the horses , I am sure .	30.453010858749
His complexion became pale with anger , and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature .	16.806081460245228
It would be such a delicious scheme , and I dare say would hardly cost any thing at all .	16.280758505920986
She would not give him time to reply , but hurrying instantly to her husband , called out as she entered the library , Oh !	9.437701053494074
mamma , do the people here abouts know I am married to-day ?	43.035708093730584
She is well , and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother .	25.161059442946527
Oh !	8965.45062507954
A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe .	16.86094509209416
Perhaps she is full young to be much in company .	68.95422496861939
I know very well that nothing can be done .	98.38510211451013
She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool ;	91.41563771864305
Bennet , how can you abuse your own children in such a way ?	39.46935200668982
You refuse to obey the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude .	35.30883592737325
It is a circumstance which Darcy of course would not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady's family , it would be an unpleasant thing .	5.863364607818653
but to say the truth , I was too cross to write .	43.22221559317379
that she is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference , and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him , she means ( most kindly ) to put me on my guard ?	5.306424030934032
for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ;	11.800509198453948
You have no regard , then , for the honour and credit of my nephew !	25.169311244496146
There was no arguing upon such a project .	126.3069321801091
But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue , she could easily conjecture .	7.0610722078622805
But the person who advanced , was now near enough to see her , and stepping forward with eagerness , pronounced her name .	10.341073075826742
As she went up stairs to get ready , Bennet followed her , saying , I am quite sorry , Lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself .	6.042412056931932
He heard her with astonishment .	471.6336941039698
but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets , she soon grew too much interested in the game , too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes , to have attention for any one in particular .	4.954929595575783
She is my youngest girl but one .	183.11164061086836
Lydia came to us ;	874.9755225198612
Every body was surprised ;	874.3743526923491
Her performance on the piano-forte is exquisite .	182.96855453179248
Elizabeth , construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister , was pleased ;	18.875475105293628
I did hear , too , that there was a time , when sermon-making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present ;	8.296881263814406
I must find Gardiner this moment , on business that cannot be delayed ;	35.353504518366435
And with a low bow he left her to attack Darcy , whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched , and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident .	6.248356381622445
she had no conversation , no style , no taste , no beauty .	35.322606185092724
If your feelings are still what they were last April , tell me so at once .	21.719425189589366
In pompous nothings on his side , and civil assents on that of his cousins , their time passed till they entered Meryton .	10.837402931171987
and in his manner of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment , reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh , and trusting their opinion of her their opinion of every body would always coincide , there was a solicitude , an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard ;	2.876530675566663
Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case , unknown to the society of Hertfordshire ;	9.098017743136907
Bingley and Jane were standing together , a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other .	13.894784266034417
Does that young lady know Darcy ?	284.1273713928716
I shall not sport with your impatience , by reading what he says on that point .	21.80753252305954
But whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ;	5.882009395006151
That such a consequence as this should ensue , you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts .	15.013025038246063
Pray tell your sister that I long to see her .	73.92049878211517
A single man of large fortune ;	299.28160023819277
It was the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton , and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace .	12.226916507597473
and if they are not married already , make them marry .	55.981899238617636
and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend .	16.86436274563545
Her father captivated by youth and beauty , and that appearance of good humour , which youth and beauty generally give , had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind , had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her .	3.6270978616315266
and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men .	13.546162820241028
My good , kind brother !	471.7187122003186
Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character , but said nothing .	35.42524847658046
If my children are silly I must hope to be always sensible of it .	30.5903650640888
It was the favourite wish of his mother , as well as of her's .	33.84933391061616
How could I be so silly as to wish it !	69.09666182440024
Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you , as his father did before him ?	21.733775991790566
The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family .	69.21084737157189
In another minute Bingley , but without seeming to have noticed what passed , took leave and rode on with his friend .	11.51160195691174
I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family .	6.239646354928108
I can readily believe , answered he gravely , that report may vary greatly with respect to me ;	16.823736241774075
Perhaps other people have said so before , but not one with such justice .	29.569821654726788
I speak feelingly .	1852.194383273414
Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth , this was not the best method of recommending herself ;	15.431141229468379
I did not know before , continued Bingley immediately , that you were a studier of character .	20.426102583293854
Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ;	471.97579738545653
I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for I am fond of superior society ;	19.0229194275887
I always had a value for him .	182.91298768734313
You will easily comprehend , from these particulars , that Wickham's circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be .	10.3397757532781
and Jane , who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience , from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit , was delighted at her entrance .	5.014389540647087
My dear Friend , If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me , we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives , for a whole day's t te- -t te between two women can never end without a quarrel .	3.396002234290152
Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife .	71.96594005156966
She is a great deal too ill to be moved .	72.1370412011244
On distinguishing the ladies of the group , the two gentlemen came directly towards them , and began the usual civilities .	12.604868243936782
You could scarcely escape discredit and misery .	184.0126658638494
They stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece , who , astonished and confused , scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face , and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family .	4.255274834882034
Elizabeth made no answer .	887.971314381906
They were forced to conclude , that he had no pleasing intelligence to send , but even of that they would have been glad to be certain .	8.907084784889161
One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight .	31.253467733597542
I do not believe a word of it , my dear .	59.33101615843412
we must forget it ourselves .	474.24960150590704
And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman .	16.804313461416644
Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party .	68.92806977561507
What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory , and as she recalled his very words , it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other ;	4.9770001590640955
They now walked on in silence ;	282.3998896388649
Jane resolutely kept her place at the table ;	126.16204433383203
then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms .	35.3051414270065
Are you going much farther ?	474.4789018806176
I have met with two instances lately ;	183.01050080048506
I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy .	53.707575946191874
for I dare not hope , he continued in a lower and more serious tone , that he is improved in essentials .	11.826890867518781
Do you often dance at James's ?	283.22460356926354
In anticipating the happiness of Bingley , which of course was to be inferior only to his own , he continued the conversation till they reached the house .	7.817873602278156
Indeed , Bennet , said she , it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that I should be forced to make way for her , and live to see her take my place in it !	4.448558141217745
And Mary King is safe !	471.6776795740263
Jane ran to her uncle and aunt , and welcomed and thanked them both , with alternate smiles and tears .	15.065641480297483
By all means , cried Bingley ;	282.84237656843413
After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence , health , good humour and cheerfulness began to re-appear at Longbourn .	11.232786303236127
and Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again , whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them .	6.574220935053047
Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off .	53.73474210519279
if he were so , they could not succeed .	95.98294188868644
her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances , and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else Darcy was condemned as the worst of men .	7.339112663925494
In a few days Bingley returned Bennet's visit , and sat about ten minutes with him in his library .	15.490900662794056
and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister , and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them .	5.869056479582305
Besides , there was truth in his looks .	126.07739456675078
but at any rate , was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal .	37.56028049241279
were questions with which she amused herself .	182.9046321206164
I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind .	53.74762627701969
But , however , he is very welcome to come to Netherfield , if he likes it .	20.9133972890869
A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty ;	16.128844635974684
But Gardiner , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in her hopes as her fears ;	6.051381713391886
She then hastened away to her mother , who had purposely broken up the card party , and was sitting up stairs with Kitty .	10.25396233338659
and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Denny , to whom Lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned ;	3.332190416969335
but to her own more extensive information , he was the person , to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as what Jane felt for Bingley .	3.1677174774955987
What would I give to hear your strictures on them !	68.89798468115653
Lizzy , said he , what are you doing ?	111.25334914699611
You will find her manners beyond any thing I can describe ;	53.78195889436478
I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had .	69.07433763864528
What an agreeable man Sir William is , Bingley is not he ?	43.04882974272492
I always said it must be so , at last .	71.92635734536411
People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking .	21.71546549754084
Though Lydia had never been a favourite with them , and Gardiner could not but be deeply affected .	18.43438111534896
But so they always are .	471.61294093744067
But to be sure , the good lady who shewed us the house , did give him a most flaming character !	13.06568439998544
He was most highly esteemed by Darcy , a most intimate , confidential friend .	29.561525680131872
Not to appear to disgrace his family , to degenerate from the popular qualities , or lose the influence of the Pemberley House , is a powerful motive .	7.330216152639498
It is too long ago .	471.8542217062196
No , my dear ;	874.9652652972713
Annesley is with her .	872.7545377705296
Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they admired her and liked her , and pronounced her to be a sweet girl , and one whom they should not object to know more of .	5.020753333180789
but since he had been in the militia , it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them .	9.414448901093056
I do not believe Long will do any such thing .	70.22360954128101
Ten thousand a year !	872.7545377705304
but allow me to assure you that I have your respected mother's permission for this address .	22.828762130280477
Darcy sends you all the love in the world , that he can spare from me .	24.222394910943144
Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk , they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance , and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance .	4.214595912237495
Yes ;	11559.025432404986
Is not he a charming man ?	282.84237656843413
Oh , Lizzy !	1719.2025306586143
I came to try you .	471.5869008114699
Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes .	188.72828420433402
His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same , said Elizabeth angrily ;	18.999738116764487
which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption , she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister , had been formed before he quitted the inn , and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there , had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend .	3.0811751548540984
You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing .	53.78195889436478
We shall be at Newcastle all the winter , and I dare say there will be some balls , and I will take care to get good partners for them all .	7.3082325411028695
They have known her much longer than they have known me ;	53.70590211892944
What say you , Mary ?	471.79674056764355
and Charlotte , detained first by the civility of Collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear .	4.2192351136207575
She was at least free from the offence of Darcy's farther notice ;	43.05634531159169
and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close ;	13.528265009535962
Read it aloud , said their father , for I hardly know myself what it is about .	18.995413237366122
But really , Ma'am , I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters , that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early .	4.699550987379317
The present always occupies you in such scenes does it ?	68.88060192205867
You do not look well .	478.255134042658
Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this , but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head .	14.30117992312255
You are severe on us .	472.2019723359574
and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me , because you have always so much .	13.530359480279413
Very true , my dear , that is exactly what I say .	52.76120369319963
Collins was punctual to his time , and was received with great politeness by the whole family .	19.623621490428963
One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man , with family , fortune , every thing in his favour , should think highly of himself .	8.296731956299343
and if you persist in indifference , do not make me your confidante .	36.74946493131584
and when occasionally , unable to resist the impulse of curiosity , she raised her eyes to his face , she as often found him looking at Jane , as at herself , and frequently on no object but the ground .	4.389730020522592
My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this .	43.044478702678006
Elizabeth longed to explore its windings ;	282.36821123640004
and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of , she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours .	9.067503757813823
You are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room , said Darcy , looking at the eldest Miss Bennet .	13.822239304065867
But you are always giving her the preference .	126.41406564273024
I am confident that she would have performed delightfully .	95.66996706420893
You shall not defend her , though it is Charlotte Lucas .	55.93645973431425
Darcy is impatient to see his sister , and to confess the truth , we are scarcely less eager to meet her again .	10.332029168542102
After this period , every appearance of acquaintance was dropt .	68.92124585403512
As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not , she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind .	8.219677778653077
how I wanted you !	875.1536282906261
She wrote again when the visit was paid , and she had seen Miss Bingley .	28.303512321016747
This cannot be !	1853.3918414790764
What think you of books ?	471.7967405676444
But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them .	53.69912713206408
And yours , he replied with a smile , is wilfully to misunderstand them .	30.58837661331483
His accompanying them was a double advantage ;	182.97831599814833
and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness .	11.515832072420146
On such encouragement to ask , Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away .	15.052233171204819
While these newly-born notions were passing in their heads , the perturbation of Elizabeth's feelings was every moment increasing .	15.02710207686114
This letter is from Collins .	471.83633721714693
Darcy , on the contrary , had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion , for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest , and from none received either attention or pleasure .	4.398266603162735
but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas .	19.58832405177827
his society was irksome , and his attachment to her must be imaginary .	38.04970176345725
It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ;	7.785056721733178
Bingley replied that he did , and made his congratulations .	68.91596052955202
Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at Brighton .	17.351267185632484
But that gentleman , looking at Darcy , seemed to think the country was nothing at all .	19.11160393209656
An airing would do me a great deal of good , I am sure .	36.395124144593154
Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew ;	56.25736817180696
and on her pausing , he asked her , if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends .	11.524938844893414
and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her , the worth of each was eclipsed by Bingley and Netherfield .	9.804997498393055
No , nothing at all .	475.3415632711509
The turn of your countenance I shall never forget , as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way , that would induce you to accept me .	6.391796196213595
Yes , almost every day .	472.33838790183415
but Bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished , was excessively disappointed .	14.265612148750296
I desire you will stay where you are .	126.08274271012002
though their kindness to Jane , such as it was , had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration .	8.860891951884252
How could his will be disregarded ?	283.53679232883877
Collins readily assented , and a book was produced ;	91.38329286713865
Darcy corroborated it with a bow , and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth , when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger , and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other , was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting .	3.1155427827402016
It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now .	126.1337597851986
She dared not relate the other half of Darcy's letter , nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend .	8.885716300962264
On entering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo , and was immediately invited to join them ;	15.015513039441691
Lydia , my love , though you are the youngest , I dare say Bingley will dance with you at the next ball .	11.906850657451937
The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth .	91.33489401897373
She was sorry that Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them ;	15.43646873104426
The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , cake , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ;	6.832491085835166
She had always seen it with pain ;	183.07554918467983
I cannot do justice to his kindness .	193.16733354996626
Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party .	43.17738383439728
Your conjecture is totally wrong , I assure you .	95.74391888895711
and Lydia , self-willed and careless , would scarcely give them a hearing .	35.30615862652983
Hurst looked at her with astonishment .	300.1174020106663
As soon as ever Bingley comes , my dear , said Bennet , you will wait on him of course .	16.294583060639514
Indeed I do not dare .	475.81002398743766
But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence .	126.08821285810164
But she is perfectly amiable , and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies .	12.29952570102396
and she thought , more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire , than as she had seen him at Pemberley .	11.369423291366534
to Miss Lydia Bennet , ' without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or any thing .	8.415498682584117
but satisfying them instantly on that head , she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons , reading the two letters aloud , and dwelling on the postscript of the last , with trembling energy .	5.4869529599237685
I should like balls infinitely better , she replied , if they were carried on in a different manner ;	16.13817415290799
and as Miss Bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to Wickham , Georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more .	6.230900612539367
He can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear .	31.665449169544154
There was too much to be thought ;	183.26327021368132
and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind , wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite .	7.337704539001333
What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant ?	43.04882974272488
But my dearest love , tell me what dish Darcy is particularly fond of , that I may have it to-morrow .	12.315997068126064
My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect .	30.589840119652234
I dare say I shall soon see them here .	96.44980327806022
While the family were in this confusion , Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them .	19.602004036319578
and in the nearness of the Parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lived in it , the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day .	4.357896371599871
while his sisters , convinced that no country advice could be of any service , recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians .	8.117525678383938
She was overpowered by shame and vexation .	183.0260873160541
Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town ;	68.97219013655598
there is nothing in that .	476.4159896880382
Why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ?	15.910350675901162
Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow , and though she could not hear a word of it , she felt as if hearing it all , and saw in the motion of his lips the words apology , Hunsford , and Lady Catherine de Bourgh .	3.8858917775210786
and when the subject was revived the next morning , and she was again applied to , could readily answer , and with a proper air of indifference , that she had not really any dislike to the scheme .	5.332828028332583
and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints , they parted ;	31.687792372086175
For God's sake , say no more of his partners .	68.95422496861939
Whatever he said , was said well ;	183.64995882402962
They are gone off together from Brighton .	183.37215415669883
He knows of my being in town , I am certain , from something she said herself ;	20.79435002662325
He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant .	132.49260748029124
The prospect of such delights was very cheering , and they parted in mutual good spirits .	22.41201742807444
she still expected that it would all end well , and that every morning would bring some letter , either from Lydia or her father , to explain their proceedings , and perhaps announce the marriage .	5.015446158552245
Perhaps he had been civil , only because he felt himself at ease ;	35.33961345722203
and indeed I am quite of your opinion .	126.08232441121416
he will rant and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter .	13.937249068153545
Lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in Bingley's way .	17.34545030504351
You may remember what I told you on that point , when first we talked of it .	19.595986881396794
And they must marry !	872.9911838121304
Consider how important every moment is , in such a case .	58.25749843352244
From something that he told me in our journey hither , I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him .	11.5179113758045
Indeed , Collins , all praise of me will be unnecessary .	53.9103190316772
I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well , when she came into the room this morning .	19.033764041093566
My conduct may I fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own .	13.526131990125785
his style was not penitent , but haughty .	126.40321939341025
And even Mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it .	31.214831266242832
and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it .	44.95523790755122
Though she dared not depend upon the consequence , she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour .	19.018098217190705
On being made acquainted with the present Darcy's treatment of him , she tried to remember something of that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad , which might agree with it , and was confident at last , that she recollected having heard Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud , ill-natured boy .	3.0888894778606866
To all the objections I have already urged , I have still another to add .	25.152093510677542
There was another reason too for her opposition .	126.30693218010933
for she only came , I suppose , to tell us the Collinses were well .	28.2757884428352
I am only resolved to act in that manner , which will , in my own opinion , constitute my happiness , without reference to you , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me .	5.098235184821216
'Ah !	15895.509420740158
She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved .	91.3336994971489
He has also brotherly pride , which with some brotherly affection , makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister ;	10.339667769460673
but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them ;	11.267382219812346
It was generally evident whenever they met , that he did admire her ;	36.62896711419426
as we went along , Kitty and me drew up all the blinds , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ;	11.259149944453148
I am talking of possibilities , Charles .	182.9591704124464
because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth .	25.14344703474128
Mama , cried Lydia , my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they first came ;	6.922371300340091
You have said quite enough , madam .	183.20865933704724
Brighton , and a whole campful of soldiers , to us , who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia , and the monthly balls of Meryton .	6.560160675908067
He readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for her distress , wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope , and leaving his compliments for her relations , with only one serious , parting , look , went away .	3.504476926282487
and unwilling for her sister's sake , to provoke him , she only said in reply , with a good-humoured smile , Come , Wickham , we are brother and sister , you know .	5.627046086762917
As he spoke there was a sort of smile , which Elizabeth fancied she understood ;	25.243919850156065
E below .	4743.677376410631
And she rose as she spoke .	282.38495090954865
Well !	15921.065892251476
There is nothing else to be done .	184.08514305730387
His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece ;	43.04822863983996
But she had never felt so strongly as now , the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage , nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents ;	4.495783034331587
I thought too ill of him , to invite him to Pemberley , or admit his society in town .	16.154322793530998
But while he was mortal , there must be a triumph .	55.93387057871913
I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest , there is no occasion for any thing more .	8.708435407472187
It is a great comfort to have you so rich , and when you have nothing else to do , I hope you will think of us .	8.976714594980963
Do not distress me by the idea .	183.3913797227655
Nothing is more deceitful , said Darcy , than the appearance of humility .	38.84491073790258
Jane was not deceived , but she was affected ;	100.47321943613619
and if you lament over him much longer , my heart will be as light as a feather .	16.850552343370552
It is a pity they are not handsome !	126.40804599080423
what is it about ?	875.9138416182061
But Jane and Elizabeth , who agreed in wishing , for the sake of their sister's feelings and consequence , that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents , urged him so earnestly , yet so rationally and so mildly , to receive her and her husband at Longbourn , as soon as they were married , that he was prevailed on to think as they thought , and act as they wished .	2.5773055287753324
Her face is too thin ;	471.7562158696961
Their visits to Philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence .	43.065538461684
of what are you thinking ?	471.56144177488665
It was in the Times and the Courier , I know ;	53.71510125758551
and fourthly , that the match might be broken off .	68.87671581652873
She felt that Jane's feelings , though fervent , were little displayed , and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner , not often united with great sensibility .	6.400661787730247
I must not decide on my own performance .	126.3118417828892
Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible ;	6.386390466873834
but when Philips understood from him what Rosings was , and who was its proprietor , when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms , and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all the force of the compliment , and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper's room .	2.8330161970836363
There is nothing the matter with me .	184.08514305730387
And as to laughter , we will not expose ourselves , if you please , by attempting to laugh without a subject .	11.510965036649957
Here again I shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell .	29.602146744580267
Well , Colonel Fitzwilliam , what do I play next ?	72.02841353825029
Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp , and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table , and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley's .	4.100189546627812
He shall be mercenary , and she shall be foolish .	68.88161428751268
They were all of them warm in their admiration ;	91.43932345670706
These recollections will not do at all .	183.41372786452467
secondly , she was very sure that Collins had been taken in ;	46.48113564676017
The garden sloping to the road , the house standing in it , the green pales and the laurel hedge , every thing declared they were arriving .	7.94914894148364
Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption , while the servants remained .	29.549129893670315
Human nature is so prone to fall into it !	91.32606463305149
Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions , all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US unless a copyright notice is included .	7.327709929664677
Never mind Miss Lizzy's hair .	473.83324968387916
Wickham will soon be gone ;	472.27931004825064
but , stopping on his approach , received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome .	19.01478626434687
Oh !	8965.45062507954
Had Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle , she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself ;	9.721246125869975
Collins was also in the same state of angry pride .	69.11235081370383
Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered .	68.89391603519981
The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon , and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her that she was not enough recovered ;	5.135834107375798
and I find that the young man forgot to tell you , among his other communications , that he was the son of old Wickham , the late Darcy's steward .	7.087226725786261
But nothing can be done ;	502.28716040999666
but Elizabeth , to satisfy her mother , went to the window she looked , she saw Darcy with him , and sat down again by her sister .	8.053728657891293
He then sat down by her , and talked scarcely to any one else .	31.284782930368568
Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject .	91.32606463305149
How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day !	19.00017431330282
and if she might judge from his complexion , his mind was not very differently engaged .	21.80678338379342
I have not been accustomed to such language as this .	70.30037905676426
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection .	53.79442812291934
It was rather small , but well built and convenient ;	68.90130120684307
but Bennet was firm : it soon led to another ;	68.8800050922285
Next time you call , said she , I hope we shall be more lucky .	30.809087817917707
CHAPTER X Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter , as soon as she possibly could .	16.741228449985808
This preservative she had now obtained ;	282.4720197126427
Every thing , however , went on smoothly , and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch .	16.86910635041861
I was uncomfortable enough .	874.1379709485186
Gardiner , who was several years younger than Bennet and Philips , was an amiable , intelligent , elegant woman , and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces .	6.648301186691221
Yes ;	11559.025432404986
Undoubtedly .	15895.509420740158
Darcy smiled and said , You are perfectly right .	102.95219779625515
I wish I could call her amiable .	184.96794376065418
He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere , if not with equal regard .	19.016358299868806
but it is wholly out of my power .	126.99478619921958
There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter , which promises well .	26.108309407933202
This idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view ;	29.551889971986853
it must be my uncle's doings !	282.5695536052081
Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother , on her ladyship's entrance , though no request of introduction had been made .	11.81441513884346
He was fond of the country and of books ;	91.40482591310321
and in her postscript it was added , that if Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer , she could spare them very well .	8.303763258502988
How so ?	4747.096473246571
He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment , on account of some debts of honour , which were very pressing ;	12.281358526846347
They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation ;	30.589347514864002
Bingley was the principal spokesman , and Miss Bennet the principal object .	44.83919054580444
She blushed at the very idea ;	282.3506627855391
He is indeed but considering the inducement , my dear Miss Eliza , we cannot wonder at his complaisance ;	16.281490671615686
When they were all in the drawing-room , the questions which Elizabeth had already asked , were of course repeated by the others , and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give .	5.51182223422526
But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour ;	182.92153389378294
I should imagine not .	874.6229508714166
Darcy , you see , is the man !	126.49289958646521
Probably not ;	4743.677376410631
there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home , how she would like Lady Catherine , and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be ;	5.821268468868455
You may as well call it impertinence at once .	91.46486162709597
Away ran the girls , too eager to get in to have time for speech .	25.14344703474128
The insipidity and yet the noise ;	282.3552787512534
and from this time Bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them .	43.146650120291305
and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again .	16.83110302790457
and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world , he was caught by their easy playfulness .	9.835807137305267
Darcy , as well as Elizabeth , really loved them ;	81.45933900500536
It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends .	12.655370162505324
She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas , who often joined them , and good-naturedly engaged Collins's conversation to herself .	10.836279482999391
In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health , imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better .	9.087516376521608
Jane was distressed .	1861.4654342956464
My kind friends will not hear of my returning home till I am better .	29.547837867574824
what news ?	4765.151761183482
for the curiosity excited by his long absence , burst forth in such very direct questions on his return , as required some ingenuity to evade , and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial , for he was longing to publish his prosperous love .	3.9716764541723557
She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened ;	45.94673957204428
She will not be able to help calling .	141.85858502570156
His character sunk on every review of it ;	133.25262588494985
said he ;	4789.273183443888
Eliza Bennet , said Miss Bingley , when the door was closed on her , is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex , by undervaluing their own ;	5.740622311528252
On both sides it was only assertion .	183.05317268462866
though perhaps it was lucky for her husband , who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form , that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly .	6.355768309155889
Their society can afford no pleasure , that will atone for such wretchedness as this !	25.15838481915762
Let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied .	44.76685263182943
no .	14491.435035225024
He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood ;	29.637422512560402
We seem to have been designed for each other .	95.68691437732946
I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your's .	35.33458479429158
Where is your sister ?	879.4591833077116
I did for you .	875.2056017749895
Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand ;	35.31567656375617
and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months .	71.92614854690454
Easter was approaching , and the week preceding it , was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings , which in so small a circle must be important .	6.687694422237217
There was certainly at this moment , in Elizabeth's mind , a more gentle sensation towards the original , than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance .	6.955166271066847
As he quitted the room , Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire ;	5.894472411810164
indeed , you must have seen it in the papers .	68.87435935390347
I can answer your question , said Fitzwilliam , without applying to him .	36.67560665336682
In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother , though expressed most concisely , he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done , and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him .	3.9285838595831257
nor could she for a moment repent her refusal , or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again .	13.54806583214556
And so saying , he turned back with them , and walked towards the house .	27.43917733929897
How can they suit each other ?	283.9324319714328
Oh !	8965.45062507954
Can he be a sensible man , sir ?	136.66050208649952
Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room , to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself .	9.087599088245128
But , my dear Elizabeth , she added , what sort of girl is Miss King ?	25.64247096983525
But , however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination , I do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage , had it not been seconded by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving , of your sister's indifference .	3.9621907299475847
Do not wish me such an evil .	183.3913797227655
But there was much to be talked of , in marrying her ;	44.859803176159
He begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother ;	29.544908767016494
At length , quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book , which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his , she gave a great yawn and said , How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way !	3.608535755070518
To Caroline's assertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit .	25.152093510677542
and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt , than to run such a risk .	16.578056125077488
I rather wished , than believed him to be sincere ;	71.92635734536411
He heard her attentively , and then said , Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances .	3.46891962599469
Elizabeth could bear it no longer .	282.92552983379795
I assure you , that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it .	34.35588591327418
Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual .	183.64995882402962
If they had uncles enough to fill all Cheapside , cried Bingley , it would not make them one jot less agreeable .	11.972144354435128
Both , replied Elizabeth archly ;	471.56144177488665
You have now done your duty by her , and must fret no longer .	31.244311615013963
but if she is really headstrong and foolish , I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state .	4.8385425961839195
Elizabeth , equally next to Jane in birth and beauty , succeeded her of course .	25.16691442948727
and the gown which had been let down to hide it , not doing its office .	21.727108927886324
Let me be rightly understood .	473.45937670747145
Because honour , decorum , prudence , nay , interest , forbid it .	35.3051414270065
and she seized the opportunity of saying , Is your sister at Pemberley still ?	30.596111339390728
on Tuesday , his wife received a letter from him ;	74.12332346366001
It was acknowledged , however , that he was a liberal man , and did much good among the poor .	16.123453794703156
The first wish of my heart , said she to herself , is never more to be in company with either of them .	10.888438282600495
in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and I dare say it would succeed , if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way .	9.70574666649851
Darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence .	182.98440716939632
she had seen enough of Bingley's behaviour to Jane , to be convinced that she would get him at last ;	13.894642792444573
About the Court , such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon .	43.18546454091337
I have not an instant to lose .	193.51923930159046
Don't think me angry , however , for I only mean to let you know , that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side .	7.628837331080164
Bennet was quite disconcerted .	875.5263108916902
A lively imagination soon settled it all .	183.00214077930528
E7 and any additional terms imposed by the copyright holder .	68.87435935390347
He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem .	26.018590497008088
When my eyes were opened to his real character .	95.68613540573742
Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged , by the scarcity of gentlemen , to sit down for two dances ;	16.80381537735999
How strange this is !	873.2577452231428
what felicity !	4765.151761183482
I should be glad to take a turn in it , if you will favour me with your company .	15.477041094809104
and I was convinced of her affection .	183.037720053204
Her home and her housekeeping , her parish and her poultry , and all their dependent concerns , had not yet lost their charms .	10.009947456054492
and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls ;	8.301510427141455
They soon outstripped the others , and when they had reached the carriage , and Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind .	10.382896318651921
But if he returns no more this winter , my choice will never be required .	25.184054488417853
Your first position is false .	471.9878147802151
and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him .	13.529143359917656
Five daughters brought up at home without a governess !	91.32606463305157
What does Darcy mean , said she to Charlotte , by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster ?	17.298718396702295
There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men .	29.551080352454075
I will go directly to Bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , I am sure .	16.0373376767169
She smiled , but made no answer .	183.56779344167384
As to his real character , had information been in her power , she had never felt a wish of enquiring .	13.46806231709632
Darcy was delighted with their engagement ;	283.7016743464221
Bingley had danced with her twice , and she had been distinguished by his sisters .	28.972245373900932
But if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal it , he must find it out .	10.84848065527552
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged , every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him .	10.339792580976457
- You provide , in accordance with paragraph 1 .	91.32606463305157
and , as he had likewise foretold , he took his seat at the bottom of the table , by her ladyship's desire , and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater .	5.2701152525190755
A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her , a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude , and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter .	4.040051888538843
Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile , but Elizabeth could not return it .	26.00264443772622
It would have been strange if they had .	126.38646874592236
every thing must sink under such a proof of family weakness , such an assurance of the deepest disgrace .	15.47845023099847
She has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject , to give greater what shall I call it ?	9.516252260718652
and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance , especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again .	8.407366300089057
When the ladies returned to the drawing-room , there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk , which she did without any intermission till coffee came in , delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted .	3.1778360834249555
And her neighbours at Lucas lodge , therefore , ( for through their communication with the Collinses , the report she concluded had reached lady Catherine ) had only set that down , as almost certain and immediate , which she had looked forward to as possible , at some future time .	3.3715635847469745
I really cannot laugh at it .	282.33513186395595
The Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan S Fairbanks , AK , 99712 .	25.988999948091063
the door was thrown open , and she ran into the room .	44.76315237065003
Perhaps this concealment , this disguise , was beneath me .	68.95422496861939
Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion , and complimented her on bearing it so well .	19.00571686984132
But , my dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me obstinate if I still assert , that , considering what her behaviour was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion .	4.533930616476333
Do you suppose them to be in London ?	132.83994733951457
Once or twice she could discern a faint blush ;	91.32606463305149
But , however , that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here , I am determined .	21.176623081021358
But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into , was shortly relieved , and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope , by an article of news , which then began to be in circulation .	4.506414846505204
Can I speak plainer ?	875.3628094531122
Some time or other he will be but it shall not be by me .	30.679998626553132
As they went down stairs together , Charlotte said , I shall depend on hearing from you very often , Eliza .	12.307952197183091
I have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse .	68.90674855033151
By nature inoffensive , friendly and obliging , his presentation at James's had made him courteous .	22.43309835108577
he had looked at her without admiration at the ball ;	69.12563827436867
But , in my opinion , it is a paltry device , a very mean art .	23.143849202688624
His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear .	43.04822863983996
She must own that she was tired of great houses ;	68.8797573713175
But if it be only a slight , thin sort of inclination , I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away .	9.392239831461941
Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us , which becomes herself and daughter .	17.311137037281913
Laugh as much as you chuse , but you will not laugh me out of my opinion .	20.175544635143865
What do I not owe you !	283.5302548065635
Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies ;	30.59860322885911
There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire .	68.96527985521826
It is excellent news , capital news , and about a certain person that we all like .	19.582400372833714
you sly thing !	1867.8877100436616
On Miss Lucas's persevering , however , she added , Very well ;	55.67657039588712
I found , said he , as the time drew near , that I had better not meet Darcy ;	18.776805740288214
She then read the first sentence aloud , which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly , and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street , where Hurst had a house .	4.101974430520141
but his father's uncommon attachment to me , irritated him I believe very early in life .	21.743874566624882
Elizabeth hoped she had silenced him ;	282.36821123640004
You want to tell me , and I have no objection to hearing it .	33.93870203606992
Amongst the most violent against him was Bennet , whose dislike of his general behaviour , was sharpened into particular resentment , by his having slighted one of her daughters .	6.560160675908067
Yes , Ma'am , that he was indeed ;	146.45540505124404
In consequence of an agreement between the sisters , Elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother , to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day .	6.173021865900792
With his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous , contained much good sense and solid reasoning .	6.562145125624383
Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education , and who has lived in the world , is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers ?	8.190400009406357
On Sunday , after morning service , the separation , so agreeable to almost all , took place .	16.80980528159705
As a brother , a landlord , a master , she considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship !	13.567856935403821
You shall have it in few words .	182.93260667638552
I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden , and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter !	11.033157580604634
In such an exigence my uncle's advice and assistance would be every thing in the world ;	22.911382209259624
So much the better .	824.3308410226997
And tell my dear Lydia , not to give any directions about her clothes , till she has seen me , for she does not know which are the best warehouses .	6.5448341241121275
On Saturday he came again .	472.01406973041344
but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way , and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow evening .	6.239837965219213
Yet in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin Elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may incur , by a precipitate closure with this gentleman's proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of .	3.747614735066833
it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Bingley's being there ;	24.298950366272575
There is a gentleman with him , mamma , said Kitty ;	54.004607016668174
The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her .	12.281251562774058
After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event , which Elizabeth considered as all but certain , and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible ;	6.354764443717483
Lydia the humiliation , the misery , she was bringing on them all , soon swallowed up every private care ;	13.537450638474674
Go , my dear , cried her mother , and shew her ladyship about the different walks .	23.711364251144442
Lady Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes , and consideration for his comfort , appeared very remarkable .	16.81832256940658
it remains to be told why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where I assure you there are many amiable young women .	7.4809524375164145
and he afterwards took occasion to ask her , when unattended to by any of the rest , whether all her sisters were at Longbourn .	8.890830229793737
But I was embarrassed .	873.6176034934608
A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern .	68.90419103435433
It cannot be done too much ;	284.16505484237615
Elizabeth , with a triumphant sensation , looked towards his friend .	55.99440982820623
Are you out of your senses , to be accepting this man ?	43.19822348525287
Oh !	8965.45062507954
So much the better .	824.3308410226997
Oh !	8965.45062507954
Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint ;	11.234273804135144
But he is a liberal master , I suppose , and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue .	13.794138982009539
I shall see her in January .	282.7107519277388
and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married .	16.83110302790457
He has a very satirical eye , and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself , I shall soon grow afraid of him .	9.422284208641438
Elizabeth , who knew this to be levelled at Darcy , was in such misery of shame , that she could hardly keep her seat .	9.297595036106475
how I should like to be married before any of you ;	56.02030499602075
It must be his own doing .	285.123218843204
Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment , and then replied , The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind .	14.1202543603272
Bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Darcy ;	11.513822664569652
and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress ;	43.063912489740346
They then went away .	873.0466036832208
Their reception at home was most kind .	183.0801985162523
There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again ;	35.31603681219684
Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast , and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before .	14.258887546781647
I must speak to Hill , this moment .	126.3118417828892
But I know the foundation is unjust .	183.04375019823956
It was absolutely necessary , therefore , to think of something , and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in Hertfordshire , and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure , she observed , How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November , Darcy !	3.1756851678611446
Darcy is not to be laughed at !	203.57591261080916
The party did not supply much conversation .	182.92503594593404
But do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us ?	33.557452414204356
Having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and from her age and disposition , greater steadiness than first attachments often boast ;	5.6855331749690565
Pleased with the preference of one , and offended by the neglect of the other , on the very beginning of our acquaintance , I have courted prepossession and ignorance , and driven reason away , where either were concerned .	4.55991517617648
When alone with Elizabeth afterwards , she spoke more on the subject .	43.17766600301922
Never , since reading Jane's second letter , had she entertained a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her .	15.040948850405211
gave her hand with an affectionate smile to Wickham , who followed his lady , and wished them both joy , with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness .	6.473029683308477
and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ;	8.302831426271208
We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect .	25.226269963512657
and , therefore , I am not afraid of speaking openly .	66.33527662425347
He then shut the door , and coming up to her , claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister .	12.813099014093648
and it might strike them that they could be more economically , though less expeditiously , married in London , than in Scotland .	10.338636664758805
Is it not clear enough ?	472.51125484192454
and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes ;	36.631878685960736
His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case , but his reliance on mine , made every thing easy .	8.300415795909215
She looked at his two sisters , and saw them making signs of derision at each other , and at Darcy , who continued however impenetrably grave .	8.428075794578767
and , after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table , they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper , who attended , in the absence of her daughters .	5.099003983295667
He was very fond of them .	299.4313306454829
And you may be certain that when I have the honour of seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualifications .	6.239391647686628
She was not rendered formidable by silence ;	184.10669842602937
It was , on the contrary , exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes ;	24.38825395326348
Do you really think so ?	473.2078882033416
I owe all that I know of it , to another , not to you .	25.144158078458087
CHAPTER XV .	4138.577761074046
A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little .	183.00214077930528
but she was flattered and pleased .	284.18790493673947
She attracted him more than he liked and Miss Bingley was uncivil to her , and more teazing than usual to himself .	12.19136539009666
And what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her ?	30.63404998036584
Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness , openness , ductility of his temper , though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own , and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied .	5.171104429791407
In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable , and Jane to make her resigned .	21.719671163150803
But perhaps Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle .	5.45875258224569
Very true , indeed ;	875.3628094531122
Her performance was pleasing , though by no means capital .	71.94411028431477
What are we to do !	471.79674056764355
I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner .	35.30624493575843
and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark .	22.435214354059823
and when Wickham walked into the room , Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before , nor thinking of him since , with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration .	6.346232465548537
Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy , drawn when she was only eight years old .	15.47845023099847
Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail .	35.322606185092724
what it contains , has surprised me a good deal .	69.03007866997895
it will then be early enough for expectation .	132.5765586276133
I will try again .	874.2680413756638
He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire .	126.25110964981222
If I wished to think slightingly of any body's children , it should not be of my own however .	15.026853187255432
There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings !	91.45466636537445
His choice is disinterested at least , for he must know my father can give her nothing .	18.999738116764487
This is an evening of wonders , indeed !	126.36433246499743
1 .	10898.860396037358
If he had been wavering before , as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy , as dignity unblemished could make him .	3.3572293752430977
it was not their wish to force her communication .	91.51710377887684
You wish to think all the world respectable , and are hurt if I speak ill of any body .	15.010369526839744
F2 .	15895.509420740158
He was received by Bennet with a degree of civility , which made her two daughters ashamed , especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend .	5.3587664876440915
That is the place to get husbands .	183.20956974969667
Sir , you quite misunderstand me , said Bennet , alarmed .	62.54966049378418
engaged to Darcy !	1852.072171128788
How far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs , I cannot tell ;	22.416412601025943
and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown .	91.65185088429212
only think !	4743.677376410631
But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley .	21.725223954042526
and then you may say whatever you like of me .	68.9786487104967
Gardiner was standing a little behind ;	282.6147487674214
His behaviour to her sister was such , during dinner time , as shewed an admiration of her , which , though more guarded than formerly , persuaded Elizabeth , that if left wholly to himself , Jane's happiness , and his own , would be speedily secured .	3.6060519067587147
He paused in hopes of an answer ;	182.92834490122445
but I hope this may be false .	183.09866929837398
But I think Darcy improves on acquaintance .	183.04375019823956
Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , reflecting on what she had heard , and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it , when Sir William Lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family .	4.039675871319081
It is a rule with me , that a person who can write a long letter , with ease , cannot write ill .	10.34307952585278
I know little of the game , at present , said he , but I shall be glad to improve myself , for in my situation of life Philips was very thankful for his compliance , but could not wait for his reason .	4.347584049973053
For such an attachment as this , she might have sufficient charms ;	47.10944697038225
On the strength of Darcy's regard Bingley had the firmest reliance , and of his judgment the highest opinion .	15.710603131638074
With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Bingley and talked of Darcy may be guessed .	25.15648712389803
He walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind ;	14.831807060085831
I am not going to run away , Papa , said Kitty , fretfully ;	29.583123031499397
Her not objecting , does not justify him .	126.11830890827804
I am sorry to pain you but so it was .	70.37093455301542
Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in undiminished beauty ;	126.13407837271967
for Lady Catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men .	3.7026960483080416
She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place , and accordingly began by observing , that his arrival had been very unexpected for your housekeeper , she added , informed us that you would certainly not be here till to-morrow ;	3.6715201420164014
Oh !	8965.45062507954
there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded , and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time .	11.242918633229102
He looked surprised , displeased , alarmed ;	182.92834490122445
In a moment they were all out of the chaise , rejoicing at the sight of each other .	16.826306613263714
I wish this may be more intelligible , but though not confined for time , my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent .	7.790762485353194
and on the part of Bennet and Kitty , though she was perfectly unknown to them , even inferior to what Elizabeth felt .	10.74242952820456
Eager to be alone , and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt , she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley , and then hurried away to dress .	5.0913683189041805
His countenance , voice , and manner , had established him at once in the possession of every virtue .	15.012319741156213
He assured her that as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ;	29.544908767016494
Already arisen !	4743.677376410631
an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope , that by the following Christmas , she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day , unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war-office , another regiment should be quartered in Meryton .	3.1510572285499716
Ah !	13586.708929614973
On the evening before my going to London , said he I made a confession to him , which I believe I ought to have made long ago .	7.893347428269235
As they passed into other rooms , these objects were taking different positions ;	35.41696980258963
The path just admitted three .	471.6236116866055
her's lasted a little longer ;	471.56144177488665
Do not let us quarrel about the past .	126.38891778371976
He was a tall , heavy looking young man of five and twenty .	36.64183412688137
Elizabeth was not comfortable ;	873.8232641244884
But I dare not hope it .	299.35531962574896
The strangeness of Collins's making two offers of marriage within three days , was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted .	11.798946922493277
and if you are not kind to us , brother , I do not know what we shall do .	18.01852662727287
Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports , by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under .	6.923269785579008
but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship , I suspect his gratitude misleads him , and that in spite of her being his patroness , she is an arrogant , conceited woman .	5.320111829312459
But it is of small importance .	284.3846840129328
Your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct , I am sure .	32.085261832577466
I [ Illustration : A VICARAGE HOUSE .	182.9129876873433
E7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1 .	13.814597532885443
Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself ;	8.73169769656924
I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one .	70.37093455301542
By all that I have ever read , I am convinced that it is very common indeed , that human nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other , real or imaginary .	3.3633391852415904
At night she opened her heart to Jane .	126.17246824872785
That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Bingley and Jane , she had never doubted ;	16.8839731601366
Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner ;	68.90145348332247
I roused , and interested you , because I was so unlike them .	35.30624493575843
Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty .	10.845143808459799
and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared with his friend .	6.687796115635207
Put them next to your great uncle the judge .	91.32606463305149
She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done , and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct .	11.526983424495665
And which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty ?	29.546424213635913
My dear Lizzy , you cannot think me so weak , as to be in danger now .	19.72113198083489
She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself , in their first evening at Philips's .	12.600527627078154
I wish it may .	938.246346378802
She approached , and saw the likeness of Wickham suspended , amongst several other miniatures , over the mantle-piece .	15.00992870923627
but on beholding it , ( for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library , ) he started back , and begging pardon , protested that he never read novels .	5.676615854981211
When she thought of her mother indeed , her confidence gave way a little , but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with Darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend's connections , than from their want of sense ;	2.978704493154928
The very last evening was spent there ;	182.92503594593404
and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to .	8.888067564821094
CHAPTER XX .	4747.787542098787
Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand .	182.93276980679664
The children have been wanting me this half hour .	91.33489401897373
To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed , she soon afterwards said , I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal .	4.700165965772336
DEAR SIR , I must trouble you once more for congratulations .	55.92991835555153
After breakfast , the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Wickham were returned , and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball .	8.888478299232611
By Hurst and Miss Bingley , they were noticed only by a curtsey ;	40.002827172820005
and she was quite decided at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining Bingley for his sister .	6.755449271910624
She could have added , A young man too , like you , whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable but she contented herself with And one , too , who had probably been his own companion from childhood , connected together , as I think you said , in the closest manner !	3.105797771270843
the ladies had crowded round the table , where Miss Bennet was making tea , and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee , in so close a confederacy , that there was not a single vacancy near her , which would admit of a chair .	3.9843000671494466
She is a most charming young lady indeed .	126.50490706986895
This matter may be considered , therefore , as finally settled .	53.71558467193521
Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go , merely on that account , for in general you know they visit no new comers .	8.903297019875039
I never saw any one so shocked .	203.86717918887587
and if I were determined to get a rich husband , or any husband , I dare say I should adopt it .	12.537643227792632
I cannot find out that I hate her at all , or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl .	7.954171269054106
but Collins , much offended , laid aside his book , and said , I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp , though written solely for their benefit .	5.284942642676807
but her letters were always long expected , and always very short .	43.22221559317379
but their progress was slow , for Gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little .	3.3255184024280564
has thrown herself into the power of of Wickham .	91.32606463305149
To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever .	53.718143523166326
Elizabeth had settled it that Darcy would bring his sister to visit her , the very day after her reaching Pemberley ;	12.297948792557152
He is also handsome , replied Elizabeth , which a young man ought likewise to be , if he possibly can .	13.551224852771176
and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects , which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world .	16.802798548425134
and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford , they reached Gardiner's house , where they were to remain a few days .	11.510075559782926
whether he had been aware of Jane's attachment , or whether it had escaped his observation ;	21.71546549754084
I suspected as much , replied Elizabeth .	182.9129876873433
and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there , to know the rest .	19.008460417816135
He has made me so happy , said she , one evening , by telling me , that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring !	8.256146638933048
Collins was gratified ;	1863.464755067734
She has one only daughter , the heiress of Rosings , and of very extensive property .	21.761955829077237
Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips .	14.387847097553074
and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter .	43.03701690971076
Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon .	69.21216290884705
Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty ;	68.89876585707488
but , however , do not speak to Darcy about it , if you had rather not .	20.19612125359822
Gardiner , whose manners were easy and pleasant , encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks ;	19.640529531406205
She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire ;	17.352173775737327
When they parted , Lady Catherine , with great condescension , wished them a good journey , and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year ;	8.134501296500149
said he , as he joined her .	201.39075399807362
I wonder that the very pride of this Darcy has not made him just to you !	21.761302893498037
E1 through 1 .	1726.7418462678622
for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing .	26.945988442839866
I will not trust myself on the subject , replied Wickham , I can hardly be just to him .	17.30586332269894
Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendance , and when immediately before my father's death , Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me , I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him , as of affection to myself .	3.0419508205752583
and Elizabeth sorry for her , and sorry for her father's speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no good .	12.935161036291436
CHAPTER XII .	4353.740372381362
Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham ;	21.717439464264224
It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family .	53.829395280153996
Occupied in observing Bingley's attentions to her sister , Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend .	7.225515501866851
but his friend Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine , tall person , handsome features , noble mien ;	10.340260196591844
To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit <URL> While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements , we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate .	3.069727221900773
Hurst sang with her sister , and while they were thus employed Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument , how frequently Darcy's eyes were fixed on her .	5.10688245056026
Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him , I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds , or any thing like it , has been advanced .	7.8896826719685444
After welcoming their sisters , they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords , exclaiming , Is not this nice ?	6.924525157238239
To these high flown expressions , Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ;	29.553086567486723
the satisfaction of Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face , as made her look handsomer than ever .	9.784810023226143
come into my room .	872.7545377705296
It is difficult indeed it is distressing .	183.00071728060837
And so , you like this man's sisters too , do you ?	43.28900647785612
and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern , when Kitty left them , she went boldly on with him alone .	9.090222593257518
Collins on his return highly gratified Bennet by admiring Philips's manners and politeness .	35.322606185092724
I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine , that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess , and that the most elevated rank , instead of giving her consequence , would be adorned by her .	4.888836505481633
So imprudent a match on both sides !	183.55008779214998
If I can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too .	14.281046766789586
But , Lizzy !	1855.2030322884725
Seriously , I would have you be on your guard .	68.87435935390347
And do you impute it to either of those ?	91.80978146744062
but as she reached the door , it was opened by a servant , and Darcy appeared .	19.034357928914147
She complained bitterly of all this to her husband .	91.3336994971489
You are very cruel , said her sister , you will not let me smile , and are provoking me to it every moment .	9.78470774995594
I have already told her so once , by your desire .	53.71909816223292
Though I know it must be a scandalous falsehood ;	91.49335049213222
Not at all .	1746.4529538439435
all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return .	37.977408278203065
My dear Charles , what do you mean ?	132.62947827642535
Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained ;	21.74678654753028
Heaven and earth !	1852.072171128788

The Miss Webbs all play , and their father has not so good an income as your's .	18.996610916885444
for while he was present , Jane had no attention to bestow on any one else ;	21.72055670069387
Come , Kitty , I want you up stairs .	91.70755495547165
I must confess myself surprised by your application ;	126.3118417828892
On opening the door , she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth , as if engaged in earnest conversation ;	10.732755328879442
He was the proudest , most disagreeable man in the world , and every body hoped that he would never come there again .	12.185217518072848
I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be .	26.00769149887723
I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours , he coldly replied .	29.596720430649054
Yes , indeed ;	1855.8024402471776
Astonishment , apprehension , and even horror , oppressed her .	68.87435935390347
and her Ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey , gave them directions as to the best method of packing , and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way , that Maria thought herself obliged , on her return , to undo all the work of the morning , and pack her trunk afresh .	2.809355415296832
As for Wickham and Lydia , their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters .	19.62176480814745
I quite detest the man .	471.5869008114699
She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Darcy that Darcy might leave the country , but that he should stand his ground ;	7.783876405428536
You have a house in town , I conclude ?	95.783020910838
Of the lady's sensations they remained a little in doubt ;	68.98385176489435
My avowed one , or what I avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which I have since made .	4.716671687197505
She saw with the creative eye of fancy , the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers .	15.034200889642621
The distance is nothing , when one has a motive ;	68.88060192205867
To know that her daughter would be married was enough .	68.90544747948664
And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing , that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood , before she was banished to the North .	7.30547280184725
You mentioned two instances .	872.9280715099725
I take up my pen again to do , what I have just told you I would not , but circumstances are such , that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here , as soon as possible .	4.81942471880161
No I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did .	35.35318467038248
Darcy said very little , and Hurst nothing at all .	69.16854904892195
and already had Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping , when an answer arrived which deferred it all .	9.78001744960569
It could not be for society , as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips ;	15.010131339046668
All this she must possess , added Darcy , and to all this she must yet add something more substantial , in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading .	6.692091431609702
It is settled between us already , that we are to be the happiest couple in the world .	17.845871011017266
But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede .	35.423759719888764
You mistake me , my dear .	322.89616237180735
And will you promise me , never to enter into such an engagement ?	35.310179490031686
The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases , and again during the chief of the day , was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Collins .	8.138441399755717
You began the evening well , Charlotte , said Bennet with civil self-command to Miss Lucas .	21.717428020397524
Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in July , and must be in London again within a month ;	8.888932508729473
Hurst thought the same , and added , She has nothing , in short , to recommend her , but being an excellent walker .	10.256168272744702
and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks .	25.162362432702263
but she was satisfied with none .	301.0865971437633
Indeed , you are mistaken , I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here .	13.778681842606955
I thought we never should have got into the coach .	69.07433763864528
She wished , she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them ;	25.98875716429147
Oh !	8965.45062507954
for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to Darcy were by no means over .	15.434324883692044
and I know I appeared distressed .	282.54371249729735
But you do not know all .	300.0409039247155
He absolutely started , and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise ;	44.729444366769016
It does seem , and it is most shocking indeed , replied Elizabeth , with tears in her eyes , that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt .	5.548297886958638
She went on .	1852.3302338812282
Nay , cried Bingley , this is too much , to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning .	9.912915716990625
How thankful am I , that we never let them know what has been said against him ;	19.00017431330282
She had also to anticipate how her visit would pass , the quiet tenor of their usual employments , the vexatious interruptions of Collins , and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings .	5.780013237291711
During their walk , it was resolved that Bennet's consent should be asked in the course of the evening .	16.15044956063509
She says Lizzy had better have taken Collins ;	126.08868754034408
This information made Elizabeth smile , as she thought of poor Miss Bingley .	36.62926206047642
but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown , before they are packed up .	10.334920809804178
No sooner did he appear , than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed ;	22.418392557222276
I can safely say , that every advance to intimacy began on her side .	29.587409406034404
It was really a very handsome thought .	182.99269458266832
perhaps that was the reason of his silence ;	126.07739456675078
You know him too well to doubt the rest .	91.53742549860284
That is an uncommon advantage , and uncommon I hope it will continue , for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance .	7.982973034608207
but where other powers of entertainment are wanting , the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given .	13.524906106513866
Miss Bennet's lovely face confirmed his views , and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority ;	13.528060981370063
But no such recollection befriended her .	282.34942266949554
In this danger Kitty is also comprehended .	183.84673474900052
and then rising up , said to Elizabeth , Miss Bennet , there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn .	7.899023970675792
Is not general incivility the very essence of love ?	91.46092348961433
nonsense , how can you talk so !	214.63135374523546
We have dined nine times at Rosings , besides drinking tea there twice !	35.39244711443272
cried he , with more feeling than politeness ;	126.88144443278031
His behaviour to myself has been scandalous ;	185.1453525321581
and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire-place , that she might be farther from the door .	12.273863306789007
but his companion was not disposed to make any ;	91.50135035633437
and , at last , on the young lady's whispering to Elizabeth again , he walked away .	19.585279414707568
Allowing the case , however , to stand according to your representation , you must remember , Miss Bennet , that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house , and the delay of his plan , has merely desired it , asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety .	3.254883056192916
I feel as if I had never done you justice , or loved you as you deserve .	18.99590370590729
Their fortune on both sides is splendid .	183.0801985162523
I remain , dear sir , with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters , your well-wisher and friend , WILLIAM COLLINS .	11.228657208683504
She then ran gaily off , rejoicing as she rambled about , in the hope of being at home again in a day or two .	9.548439240520365
In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ?	53.708791053103305
susceptibility to her feelings ;	872.7545377705296
Not all that Bennet , however , with the assistance of her five daughters , could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Bingley .	5.943631242856288
It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it .	21.751689862412416
I have not been used to submit to any person's whims .	54.74104680376976
Oh !	8965.45062507954
And what sort of table do they keep ?	126.37088414287213
but this was declined , and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness .	26.083709503869095
It will pass away soon enough .	283.4382181030144
There is nothing like dancing after all .	184.08514305730387
The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to Wickham's charge , exceedingly shocked her ;	17.29580866379148
and all was soon right again .	283.58062138511616
but I dare say he may spend half his time here ;	57.32639467498417
therefore , stay quietly at Longbourn , and depend on my diligence and care .	33.45069304427056
so tall !	4761.404895261674
In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity ;	43.04589527583547
or allow her to hear it from any one but myself .	53.78210820802474
and when at length they turned in at the lodge , her spirits were in a high flutter .	17.814360792818736
First of all , he asked Miss Lucas .	126.07739456675078
She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height , or rather taller .	43.070879927655724
Elizabeth soon heard from her friend ;	284.1747237541818
None at all .	1852.072171128788
Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again .	35.3051414270065
They must all go to Brighton .	282.3998896388649
he had felt their importance in the family circle .	91.68151151195977
It may perhaps be pleasant , replied Charlotte , to be able to impose on the public in such a case ;	13.815411819502222
and in the latter object , where she feared most to fail , she was most sure of success , for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour .	5.4462660931972655
The moment of her release from him was ecstacy .	91.33489401897373
Nay , said Elizabeth , this is not fair .	117.16863299911361
They left Brighton together on Sunday night , and were traced almost to London , but not beyond ;	16.804757946452693
I have not a doubt of your doing very well together .	53.82248689005769
What do you mean , Hill ?	284.7821187537913
and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away .	6.236298329727908
Nothing of the past was recollected with pain ;	126.29065828806903
it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life .	26.077799978510214
She had dressed with more than usual care , and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart , trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening .	4.254174304107495
and besides , it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body , and had so many favourites .	7.060940302332756
Unfortunately an only son , ( for many years an only child ) I was spoilt by my parents , who though good themselves , ( my father particularly , all that was benevolent and amiable , ) allowed , encouraged , almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing , to care for none beyond my own family circle , to think meanly of all the rest of the world , to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own .	2.1766081629529848
You are not going to be Missish , I hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report .	14.39611216955933
Aye that is because you have the right disposition .	91.70755495547165
she longed to hear more , and was grateful to her uncle for saying , There are very few people of whom so much can be said .	7.785797291119035
Whatever I do is done in a hurry , replied he ;	53.862574693791565
No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there .	43.05413889493553
When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose , or procuring any thing you had a fancy for ?	9.55850945507738
And what did she say ?	472.95899016236467
I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long .	8.886467834673905
Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact ;	91.40060461645092
Indeed I have , Sir , was her answer .	96.27642682726417
I was afraid they might not ;	282.6940414663678
Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure , but as his brother was eager in it , he meant to assist him in pursuing it .	7.727061804012864
But her commendation , though costing her some trouble , could by no means satisfy Collins , and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship's praise into his own hands .	6.411596653019265
it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister's being in town .	10.755921595768084
but the grounds are delightful .	472.8988152972219
There are few people in England , I suppose , who have more true enjoyment of music than myself , or a better natural taste .	9.62113495849077
cried Maria , after a few minutes silence , it seems but a day or two since we first came !	15.121692383056624
I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression .	29.565824374580167
Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great Lady's attention , which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others .	11.229221013576657
Sometimes she could fancy , that he talked less than on former occasions , and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her , he was trying to trace a resemblance .	4.9547784735503155
As much as I ever wish to be , cried Elizabeth warmly , I have spent four days in the same house with him , and I think him very disagreeable .	6.721469628481213
Far be it from me , he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure , to resent the behaviour of your daughter .	9.779838994100647
Nothing could be more delightful !	472.5768800241366
But if otherwise , if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been exchanged , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method , in her partiality for Wickham , and that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment .	2.071189707583226
My poor mother is really ill and keeps her room .	68.89015060068674
But of this answer Lydia heard not a word .	96.14216655721249
What a delightful library you have at Pemberley , Darcy !	69.07214697388038
Oh , sister !	1856.8414363661354
Of music !	4758.771804320917
His attachment to Rosings , certainly increases .	182.97831599814833
It was very little less .	471.8297747705117
She would not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried home ;	35.449969556128636
And Lydia used to want to go to London , added Kitty .	43.04219051738933
I have a high respect for your nerves .	126.14515658916591
he certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible ;	36.64095038746372
it seems but a fortnight I declare ;	193.07827674008317
and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body .	26.09172996712338
He then handed her in , Maria followed , and the door was on the point of being closed , when he suddenly reminded them , with some consternation , that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings .	4.127622144062784
and as to Miss Bennet , he could not conceive an angel more beautiful .	31.805614365725134
As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Bingley , and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to , made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane .	3.8580687703502017
and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence .	13.53244098166556
Its effect was most extraordinary ;	474.24960150590704
it was to remain the whole winter , and Meryton was the head quarters .	29.588755607069462
How strange !	4747.096473246571
CHAPTER IX .	4138.577761074046
Her hair so untidy , so blowsy !	182.96855453179248
Good bye .	4369.663431489112
And what is your success ?	472.95899016236467
His character was to speak for itself .	184.05864505971422
they were brightened by the exercise .	283.4006310401524
In the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more ;	43.1115927594309
Why should he have it more than anybody else ?	91.43902927083862

We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes , on purpose to pass for a lady , only think what fun !	13.89311236184166
Has he , has my nephew , made you an offer of marriage ?	37.530023886787234
cried Bennet , shaking her head , then she is better off than many girls .	25.15838481915762
Had his character been known , this could not have happened .	55.97795978514408
At that moment , she cared for no other .	91.8577931633142
where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making , and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself , some shelves in the closets up stairs .	6.937523740905237
Her Ladyship , with great condescension , arose to receive them ;	55.94486518937687
I am sure Lizzy will be very happy I am sure she can have no objection .	24.659758400910288
for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds .	29.642568051798616
Amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment ;	12.280591974049722
but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general , since Jane united with great strength of feeling , a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner , which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent .	3.603557712381935
how ardently did she long to know , whether any of his were directed in a like manner .	17.314556578201604

but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine .	17.81176581419278
And do you really know all this ?	184.02289964922304
If from no better motive , that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest , for dishonesty I must call it .	10.38312657417952
And yet , upon my honour , I believed what I said of myself to be true , and I believe it at this moment .	9.414873965722364
I did not think Gardiner was so little to be trusted .	54.80717009329305
His brother-in-law , Hurst , merely looked the gentleman ;	91.35794937764702
It was hardly enough ;	873.3008399674139
and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did not err .	23.682146755044176
It was spoken of again while they were at dinner , when Collins joining in , observed , Yes , Miss Elizabeth , you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church , and I need not say you will be delighted with her .	3.5812874804669774
if one could but go to Brighton !	183.64995882402962
It was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ;	7.062092367599245
Their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like man he is a great friend of Darcy's .	29.560848354152675
After sitting for a moment in silence , she said very stiffly to Elizabeth , I hope you are well , Miss Bennet .	11.217410371145187
But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Gardiner's letter , or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him .	4.988177815109611
You cannot refuse to dance , I am sure , when so much beauty is before you .	22.126266774201216
Well , how pleased I am !	282.86939795920557
But don't imagine it was from any silly cause .	91.33337857865774
I hope not so .	875.027485426909
Your plan is a good one , replied Elizabeth , where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married ;	12.040787223549414
I often tell young ladies , that no excellence in music is to be acquired , without constant practice .	15.009532399726695
are sufficiently known .	1852.072171128788
She saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow ;	11.245133026729263
To Elizabeth , however , he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed .	18.110287316716384
In that case he would return no more .	126.11576719060704
She dared not even mention that gentleman .	182.92227550805146
But , on second thoughts , perhaps Lizzy could tell us , what relations he has now living , better than any other person .	9.561310756890816
No one but Jane , she thought , could flatter herself with such an expectation .	25.99674463617025
The girls stared at their father .	282.3552787512534
The person of whom I speak , is a gentleman and a stranger .	36.61970032525936
Whatever my connections may be , said Elizabeth , if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to you .	10.99108872283373
He smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said .	21.717129048379526
CHAPTER XIV .	4138.577761074046
My mother would have had no objection , but my father hates London .	35.42835905665337
[ Illustration : MATLOCK ] PRIDE AND PREJUDICE : A Novel .	53.69533281330631
Kitty then owned , with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us , that in Lydia's last letter , she had prepared her for such a step .	5.946480841800328
Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could ;	136.38900121580127
Little more than half a day's journey .	199.03357292084493
and so it does I vow .	283.41355944697665
and therefore it will not signify to anybody here , what he really is .	30.68083837038157
and by that means , as I told Lady Catherine myself one day , has deprived the British court of its brightest ornament .	10.330204698592768
Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane , on their first arrival at Lambton ;	13.141746847913577
You may imagine what I felt and how I acted .	68.97248749005392
It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner .	22.416915429019177
He deserves to be publicly disgraced .	282.36081194777387
Of having another daughter married to Collins , she thought with equal certainty , and with considerable , though not equal , pleasure .	10.589164397542948
and it was settled , that as soon as the ceremony was over , they should proceed to Longbourn .	15.471068749756165
Bennet was quite in the fidgets .	283.06814670791914
The first part of Gardiner's business on her arrival , was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions .	13.557543899239796

Bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say , but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , I shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as I did before .	3.602473111489328
It seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence , a most country town indifference to decorum .	13.525051733071576
The idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ;	6.922658115342977
I know my dear uncle and aunt so well , that I am not afraid of requesting it , though I have still something more to ask of the former .	7.4826697851775155
would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe .	91.32606463305149
They look upon it quite as their own , I dare say , whenever that happens .	24.491331460852333
The subject was pursued no farther , and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away .	31.66507685476296
Reynolds informed them , that it had been taken in his father's life time .	31.784167712126806
Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets , of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won , and Collins , in describing the civility of and Philips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist , enumerating all the dishes at supper , and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House .	2.421522856141466
His principal object must be , to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham .	15.43437349606452
But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter , depended on the will of the parents .	15.46017685827644
or that may comfort you , under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parent's mind .	12.612759366378919
But I am particularly attached to these young men ;	91.76800464234148
He inquired how far Netherfield was from Meryton ;	126.09257234873176
Her father lifted up his eyes .	283.9035299069319
That you were gone into the army , and she was afraid had not turned out well .	21.0885993078658
Having said thus much , I feel no doubt of your secrecy .	43.18546454091337
Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look ;	53.862574693791565
that , that is the worst of all .	126.22115290504168
and that friendship between a person capable of it , and such an amiable man as Bingley , was incomprehensible .	14.125970860458011
and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley , in spite of that pollution which its woods had received , not merely from the presence of such a mistress , but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city .	4.473663394833199
Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished .	183.46916728554984
and very lively hopes of Bingley's heart were entertained .	91.32939756883732
He takes them now for people of fashion .	126.09257234873176
She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry ;	13.524876173483122
how can you be so teazing ?	310.0966105414115
and be ready to believe , for every body's sake , that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin .	10.330204698592768
in every view it is unaccountable !	283.4006310401524
Jane looked a little paler than usual , but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected .	25.246536025315972
said he , taking the letter from his pocket ;	92.26270299278882
La !	13586.708929614973
he hardly ever mentioned your name .	282.6147487674214
Nay , were your friend Lady Catherine to know me , I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation .	8.776998268560906
Wickham did not play at whist , and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia .	11.516730879603909
I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made her here ;	21.74834083963282
Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for common use ;	21.717439464264224
I am not a great reader , and I have pleasure in many things .	31.706406204107243
I cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen , in the whole range of my acquaintance , that are really accomplished .	11.419150776954917

Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was .	182.93276980679664
A long dispute followed this declaration ;	282.48421472310156
Undoubtedly , replied Darcy , to whom this remark was chiefly addressed , there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation .	7.632659984141993
My affections and wishes are unchanged , but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever .	13.526131990125785
What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ?	30.59262299112981
There was novelty in the scheme , and as , with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters , home could not be faultless , a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake .	5.398149311439496
She then spoke of the letter , repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham .	13.907765743642324
They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them .	35.366862003005046
They had often attempted it before , but it was a subject on which Bennet was beyond the reach of reason ;	14.097251477491925
It is nothing in comparison of Rosings , my lady , I dare say ;	35.53835443086832

Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters , would be unpardonable in me .	43.035708093730584
One morning , soon after their arrival , as she was sitting with her two elder sisters , she said to Elizabeth , Lizzy , I never gave you an account of my wedding , I believe .	5.6558341764824345
This is your final resolve !	472.9277824972055
I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good .	68.98641223763796
It will not do .	876.9000419525769
You either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other's confidence and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking ;	4.734191116926097
I quite forgot !	1852.194383273414
Charlotte herself was tolerably composed .	473.5287383739997
Elizabeth was surprised , but agreed to it immediately .	91.40060461645092
and hastily seizing a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt , if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended .	5.069160247862412
Colonel Forster will , I dare say , do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head .	16.087878801912808
You are safe from me .	472.2019723359574
Here , Sarah , come to Miss Bennet this moment , and help her on with her gown .	16.83071913337731
but from every window there were beauties to be seen .	68.8800050922285
This Younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with Wickham ;	53.71558467193521
You have insulted me , in every possible method .	91.45761331388958
from thence to the library ;	471.56144177488665
to be only just tolerable .	473.296294121307
But papa is so disagreeable .	471.61294093744067
Why must she be scampering about the country , because her sister had a cold ?	25.165658020998052
I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday .	56.184225602482144
Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley .	19.00440792647853
The vicious propensities the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which Darcy could not have .	3.3642984487705285
Jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention .	19.584587861263838
Darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish , and who probably never looked at you in his life !	9.571151758775152
The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield .	68.88060192205867
Oh !	8965.45062507954
talents which rightly used , might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters , even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife .	8.299057738918526
She turned from sister to sister , demanding their congratulations , and when at length they all sat down , looked eagerly round the room , took notice of some little alteration in it , and observed , with a laugh , that it was a great while since she had been there .	3.4045783922863744
Wickham's happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer , and Collins's proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could .	8.900522688190533
A great deal of good management , depend upon it .	74.15542863778093
You have done all this !	472.48793512142663
The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life , and where they were now to spend a few days , was probably as great an object of her curiosity , as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock , Chatsworth , Dovedale , or the Peak .	3.5128989171858214
but depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our surest way of disappointing him , will be to ask nothing about it .	7.841457376865295
It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment , from which she had been so wholly free at first .	10.381435904364247
Gardiner had seen Pemberley , and known the late Darcy by character perfectly well .	29.560848354152675
What could be the meaning of it ?	211.03510321394538
But to be candid without ostentation or design to take the good of every body's character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad belongs to you alone .	5.951786262954069
and her residence there will probably be of some duration .	68.98621197368547
But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice .	43.03858020850592
They are generally long ;	875.655748219757
Exceed their income !	1852.072171128788
Find such a woman as soon as you can , bring her to Hunsford , and I will visit her .	15.452641741746755
Elizabeth jumped out ;	1852.4837350275081
But these are not Jane's feelings ;	282.34942266949554
Elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her .	22.41257734174716
You think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly .	182.9326066763857
But you have chosen your fault well .	183.43067668199336
All loveliness and goodness as she is !	183.2378416279336
and , to my certain knowledge , more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner .	13.52953514829875
His air was grave and stately , and his manners were very formal .	36.6269978581173
As they drove to Gardiner's door , Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival ;	21.774856469723595
Oh !	8965.45062507954
But , she continued , recollecting herself , as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him .	11.621537697862701
My mother is tolerably well , I trust ;	126.67493605330237
At such a time , much might have been said , and silence was very awkward .	22.421292983605344
and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend , met her with every appearance of composure .	18.995865344765782
as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education , and who still resides with them .	17.349998965073876
But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend , where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment , should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire , without waiting to be argued into it ?	3.353696640805918
and every dish was commended , first by him , and then by Sir William , who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said , in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear .	4.746542651576182
he had lost every point ;	474.0659576450268
The housekeeper came forward , and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman , the son of her late master's steward , who had been brought up by him at his own expence .	5.320129390247635
She accounted for it , however , by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn , had by some accident been lost .	9.41443142585635
Sometimes .	15895.509420740158
for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all .	11.511970724080651
Their reception from Bennet , to whom they then turned , was not quite so cordial .	23.140978615044084
Why , I must confess , that I love him better than I do Bingley .	25.22909138371885
Aye , there she comes , continued Bennet , looking as unconcerned as may be , and caring no more for us than if we were at York , provided she can have her own way .	5.105359753121557
it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate .	35.363433255572154
He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names .	68.93004396227876
Elizabeth saw what he was doing , and at the first convenient pause , turned to him with an arch smile , and said , You mean to frighten me , Darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me ?	4.502122796083361
And when the party entered the assembly room , it consisted of only five altogether ;	25.221679743709583
It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy .	91.36417112926313
Yes but as it happens , they are all of them very clever .	35.31856060239264
When Collins could be forgotten , there was really a great air of comfort throughout , and by Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it , Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten .	6.236069575736741
Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ;	59.74679501024955
perhaps she meant well , but , under such a misfortune as this , one cannot see too little of one's neighbours .	11.228419059099583
It is evident that you belong to the first circles .	68.90375555233463
This was one point , with regard to Lydia at least , which was now to be settled , and Bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him .	5.94792955957163
and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room .	68.87671581652873
She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter , and , without knowing or considering what their income might be , rejected many as deficient in size and importance .	5.358204356033938
CHAPTER VI .	4138.577761074046
but I verily believe I could forgive him any thing and every thing , rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father .	7.786832478604183
Oh !	8965.45062507954
Her astonishment at his coming at his coming to Netherfield , to Longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire .	5.320521116082998
The promised letter of thanks from Collins arrived on Tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted .	5.530501613073883
Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of , cried Colonel Fitzwilliam .	25.182613950195666
I deserve neither such praise nor such censure , cried Elizabeth ;	53.69720858441741
She had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire Militia , in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man , who , on meeting him accidentally in town , had there renewed a slight acquaintance .	4.317960460860771
I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these .	29.56687296985187
No , said her father , Wickham's a fool , if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds .	11.809000664445813
and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane , nor half so good humoured as Lydia .	14.372996552548493
Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter ;	68.95422496861939
it jumps from admiration to love , from love to matrimony in a moment .	29.671329445136962
As soon as I get to town , I shall go to my brother , and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street , and then we may consult together as to what is to be done .	4.96473133337061
and then , on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured , he replied , Say nothing of that .	11.323610680973633
Certainly not .	4775.128987276426
Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home .	91.50792920719019
and that being the case , I cannot consider your situation with much compassion .	29.59155143711971
He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her .	25.145464917498455
the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy , received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before ;	8.050785927571889
As she had heard no carriage , she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine , and under that apprehension was putting away her half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions , when the door opened , and to her very great surprise , Darcy , and Darcy only , entered the room .	3.153178896617153
That tall , proud man .	471.83633721714693
In the hall they parted .	472.9228448238503
They were hopeless of remedy .	472.35909119365556
After an affectionate parting between the friends , Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Collins , and as they walked down the garden , he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family , not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter , and his compliments to and Gardiner , though unknown .	2.7114373995757868
but , recovering herself , said in a lively tone , And pray , what is the usual price of an Earl's younger son ?	10.01625663061829
His most particular friend , you see by Jane's account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her .	13.526947770955145
She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue , and the mere stateliness of money and rank , she thought she could witness without trepidation .	5.216982475457216
You must not disappoint your father .	284.61389969398977
Good girl !	4765.151761183482
Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection , and said something of his concern , at having been prevented by business .	11.513822664569647
You may have drawn him in .	282.85759998458224
He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying ;	32.563985691407666
But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes .	8.63341866837097
If you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence .	43.08738786922455
E3 .	15895.509420740158
I , who have prided myself on my discernment !	91.3296803691227
I beg your pardon , replied Miss Bingley , turning away with a sneer .	30.065170314918607
I am sincerely grieved for him and F but no one can throw any blame on them .	18.998614438343875
But I pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it .	5.943358688148411
He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which it seems he has been told , by some of the good-natured , gossiping Lucases .	6.688007503492278
Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly , as well as her affection for Jane ;	19.080847136615798
I am glad he dines here on Tuesday .	126.67681582846174
Each felt for the other , and of course for themselves ;	58.25749843352244
She saw herself the object of attention , to tens and to scores of them at present unknown .	16.83159852525461
on the contrary , he was all attention to every body .	59.93288504502452
and , having nothing else to say , was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him .	12.932486320046692
but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts ;	53.802826343540424
I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge .	29.553532983125727
you do not know what I suffer .	219.6364297457777
I can now say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , I have seen nothing of it .	10.590997263608887
Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education .	53.96914672548122
shocking !	15895.509420740158
She is a great fool for going away , if she liked him .	35.39331337797855
I am so pleased so happy .	282.41235840958365
Oh !	8965.45062507954
but whatever she said , was spoken in so authoritative a tone , as marked her self-importance , and brought Wickham immediately to Elizabeth's mind ;	8.885732794788465
All was joy and kindness .	472.5768800241366
I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable .	53.78238077644425
and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning .	6.68139270079967
You tear them to pieces .	471.6466798211475
she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him .	20.1837889956228
but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's .	44.75951925776925
but his sisters gave it their hearty assent , and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations .	8.893604741559331
It will be no use to us , if twenty such should come since you will not visit them .	15.460418160221693
but when Philips began to express her concern thereupon , he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance , that he considered the money as a mere trifle , and begged she would not make herself uneasy .	3.986409179102491
She seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute , and never attended to Mary at all .	14.108606314649448
but with him I believe it does not often happen .	71.92958345128093
In spite of what her sister declared , and really believed to be her feelings , in the expectation of his arrival , Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it .	5.747888317614206
but they obligingly satisfied it , with the same kind of supposition , which had appeased Bennet's curiosity ;	16.803333500345172
The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value !	29.544561385042407
but their astonishment was beyond their expectation ;	182.92308519001588
Not Lydia only , but all were concerned in it ;	68.92442634471139
They are all for what they can get .	126.37661435504874
and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared .	13.53244098166556
Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony , marriage had always been her object ;	21.791135352191375
And of this place , thought she , I might have been mistress !	38.80210210595466
Well , Monday morning came , and I was in such a fuss !	38.0239694046109
and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again .	29.56575571212479
1 .	10898.860396037358
I confess , said he , that I should not have been at all surprised by her Ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings .	7.210012573495723
determined , if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive , and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female .	3.2754923787849655
and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ;	10.360952240666517
In society so superior to what she had generally known , her improvement was great .	25.992478044041423
was fonder than ever of Georgiana , almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore , and paid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth .	9.58087622105291
gone to stay .	1852.072171128788
What will you think of my vanity ?	184.06220366702206
I thought I should have broke my heart .	126.4958453889397
Oh , Lizzy !	1719.2025306586143
and therefore checked her laugh .	474.2732030617391
She had never perceived , while the regiment was in Hertfordshire , that Lydia had any partiality for him , but she was convinced that Lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body .	5.279969738964647
Oh , yes !	1630.3553256278274
We must not make him desperate .	283.95061812676204
and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour , that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford , she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Darcy's having both spent three weeks at Rosings , and asked him if he were acquainted with the former .	3.117554876478594
His father , Miss Bennet , the late Darcy , was one of the best men that ever breathed , and the truest friend I ever had ;	8.549245979770282
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come .	5.435293855393132
It was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too , and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it .	10.332238932305064
They were off Saturday night about twelve , as is conjectured , but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight .	12.289050690504542
What is it you are talking of ?	183.8640882951814
We all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ;	35.317282284603166
His belief of her sister's insensibility , she instantly resolved to be false , and his account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice .	4.358868903369828
and pray when am I to wish you joy ?	91.32939756883732
But I cannot find out that Jane saw any thing of him in London .	32.32721196089442
I have no right to give my opinion , said Wickham , as to his being agreeable or otherwise .	15.918397804189762
Much as I abominate writing , I would not give up Collins's correspondence for any consideration .	22.906945787938593
exclaimed Elizabeth , you are too good .	192.92160119218158
But really , and upon my honour , I will try to do what I think to be wisest ;	15.684206951441091
Lydia , my love , ring the bell .	130.0180333534611
I beg your pardon ;	903.9144660650614
Is there nothing you could take , to give you present relief ?	43.08865968565439
She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution , which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments , which she could not otherwise have failed of ;	8.050654173006695
and in spite of her youth and her manners , she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her .	10.792372944307989
it told them , that on his arrival , he had immediately found out his brother , and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch street .	9.08936130611297
but I heard nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield .	35.330763557168865
but proud and conceited .	872.8690062597083
Now be sincere ;	1860.4034109326622
He only told me , what I have now told you .	58.2632740376526
Oh , that I knew how it was !	136.5951660577986
The fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious attention .	20.900897357676833
and she sat down directly to the instrument .	126.14736689527284
A short pause followed this speech , and Hurst began again .	53.71722162646691
My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them .	44.734371621489316
To no creature had it been revealed , where secresy was possible , except to Elizabeth ;	21.72259364513727
Oh !	8965.45062507954
Elizabeth thanked him from her heart , and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying .	15.432375609914216
Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility ;	43.09544223042713
The t te- -t te surprised them .	203.509860255933
But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire , she saw him from her dressing-room window , enter the paddock , and ride towards the house .	7.478895010542609
All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man , who , but three months before , had been almost an angel of light .	10.997345689634678
said Bennet , more than once , as if the credit of making it rain were all her own .	15.439785142457218
I am excessively attentive to all those things .	126.11230254886564
There was neither in figure nor face , any likeness between the ladies .	35.35249198016997
Bennet rang the bell , and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library .	36.62903528467899
They were excessively sorry to go !	282.758881562549
Can this be Darcy !	875.3628094531122
I know how much you dislike him .	183.1606683927052
After watching her a little , Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful .	31.680023498908845
Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case , and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts .	6.232896546577989
You are not well enough ;	472.2019723359574
About the middle of the next day , as she was in her room getting ready for a walk , a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion ;	6.56675305060917
Darcy said nothing at all .	474.4940668118572
At that moment they were met from another walk , by Hurst and Elizabeth herself .	25.24792663964059
repeated Miss Bingley .	1852.072171128788
For the liveliness of your mind , I did .	91.43902927083862
and not a note , not a line , did I receive in the mean time .	21.716005837894702
Bennet , we shall have her at Netherfield at last .	69.04235897003946
But I knew not I was afraid of doing too much .	53.72656130304553
but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing , that instead of twelve , he had brought only six with him from London , his five sisters and a cousin .	5.942018047638914
CHAPTER XII .	4353.740372381362
They talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his fruit , of every thing but himself ;	13.891409630058458
Well , he certainly is very agreeable , and I give you leave to like him .	21.738456712920712
Their first subject was her sister ;	282.6147487674214
and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them , threw a real gloom over their domestic circle ;	6.932943712126017
She wrote cheerfully , seemed surrounded with comforts , and mentioned nothing which she could not praise .	19.925848583264084
Balls will be absolutely prohibited , unless you stand up with one of your sisters .	25.14344703474128
There can be no occasion for your going so soon .	68.89960046029361
I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure .	10.581302155219914
With many compliments to them , and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter , to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ;	5.7798273982670185
It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs , under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants , and heedless of the future , must be very insufficient to their support ;	4.5087603869935275
Would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part , that might offer consolation to such distress .	10.579888096199983
The dinner was exceedingly handsome , and there were all the servants , and all the articles of plate which Collins had promised ;	10.920055863038
I rather wonder now at your knowing any .	126.0827427101199
and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement .	38.445187912893445
Mary and Kitty , thank Heaven !	299.853582807121
She could only imagine however at last , that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible , according to his ideas of right , than in any other person present .	4.780699811498152
Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room .	29.65864241501499
The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again , called it an age since they had met , and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation .	5.53915365392887
You supposed more than really existed .	282.36793845088044
and , though little more than sixteen , her figure was formed , and her appearance womanly and graceful .	15.01530610531042
and when she wrote again , Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys .	14.726604706625876
In Lydia's imagination , a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness .	29.548713030795167
I was never more annoyed !	472.2409275954135
You have .	4756.4971913075815
Indeed , replied Elizabeth , I am heartily sorry for him ;	64.48363447023421
The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion , and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone .	6.922658115342977
and as to my father , I never in my life saw him so affected .	26.607650408354854

and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled , she had all the success she expected .	19.01039965589488
That is a question which I hardly know how to answer .	56.001210191430665
Are the others coming out ?	472.7397147234852
I do not know .	833.899800936731
That it ought not to be attempted .	199.13174442695623
But at length , by Elizabeth's persuasion , he was prevailed on to overlook the offence , and seek a reconciliation ;	12.928172618534287
We are not in a way to know what Bingley likes , said her mother resentfully , since we are not to visit .	11.019894119923222
It was the prospect of constant society , and good society , he added , which was my chief inducement to enter the shire .	10.172652094438252
single , my dear , to be sure !	168.28943715905595
You will have a charming mother-in-law , indeed , and of course she will be always at Pemberley with you .	14.27993560070584
Elizabeth was now to see Wickham for the last time .	68.92705956107727
but not handsome enough to tempt me ;	182.92308519001605
US laws alone swamp our small staff .	182.9046321206164
with less of splendor , and more real elegance , than the furniture of Rosings .	25.14344703474128
she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us , and offered her services , or any of her daughters , if they could be of use to us .	6.6894402501138135
What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation ?	93.86269879858902
I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned .	4.042436001762149
Hear me in silence .	872.7545377705296
Neglect !	15895.509420740158
but , to counterbalance these advantages , Darcy had considerable patronage in the church , and his cousin could have none at all .	10.844574771696262
Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place ?	38.87493094662904
It makes me very nervous and poorly , to be thwarted so in my own family , and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else .	7.328052926048482
Darcy looked up .	1853.239096846129
She was teazed by Collins , who continued most perseveringly by her side , and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again , put it out of her power to dance with others .	4.964049596401229
At four o'clock , therefore , we may expect this peace-making gentleman , said Bennet , as he folded up the letter .	12.31022499578496
How should you have liked making sermons ?	182.98574828639642
What could he mean ?	878.7108448343066
I have told Miss Bennet several times , that she will never play really well , unless she practises more ;	13.528137373655143
he is a most interesting young man ;	193.10678267046848
Well , I was so frightened I did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ;	12.50676693397732
Our habits of expence make us too dependant , and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money .	6.932835279051816
And your defect is a propensity to hate every body .	68.88603074550605
We are not rich enough , or grand enough for them ;	53.95832622770024
Elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness , with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal .	11.229221013576657
They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds .	53.70590211892944
1 .	10898.860396037358
In a short time , I shall have a daughter married .	58.37447787750822
but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art ;	183.38360368998732
Charlotte the wife of Collins , was a most humiliating picture !	56.08078743925989
With my mother up stairs .	472.0284483628379
On this subject I have nothing more to say , no other apology to offer .	26.000268191287336
Though Darcy could never receive him at Pemberley , yet , for Elizabeth's sake , he assisted him farther in his profession .	11.239432722009216
I can much more easily believe Bingley's being imposed on , than that Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night ;	7.790762485353194
I cannot acquit him of that duty ;	183.1376054435776
Good Heaven !	4369.663431489112
Maria thought speaking out of the question , and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire .	19.576588253152863
Imprudent as a marriage between Wickham and our poor Lydia would be , we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place , for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland .	4.531486645816599
I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner .	16.802831066935
They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation , and always spending more than they ought .	11.517495142805634
and no less certain is it , that I cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it .	10.580087807533852
He only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town , which you must acknowledge to be true .	6.950573501774547
Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth , which spoke her distress at such premeditation , and her intreaty that she would not give into it .	8.85886076844879
He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him ;	21.717129048379526
and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry .	7.582402400305949
Poor Lydia's situation must , at best , be bad enough ;	53.82307164893263
and therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , I will take it on myself .	9.104774122325644
The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed , by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking ;	7.156172374182783
It was not in their direct road , nor more than a mile or two out of it .	16.83211978770497
As for Mary , she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection , soon after they were seated at table , This is a most unfortunate affair ;	5.222185922746249
Well , said Charlotte , I wish Jane success with all my heart ;	37.45257900839297
that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars , and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer .	2.6144300331799895
By you , I was properly humbled .	199.37273577685045
While settling this point , she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell , and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself , who had once before called late in the evening , and might now come to enquire particularly after her .	3.366445297538523
1 .	10898.860396037358
Oh !	8965.45062507954
Whatever can give his sister any pleasure , is sure to be done in a moment .	22.542737960189367
Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves ?	126.64175158863814
but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her , that she was only exceedingly shy .	21.667235277530196
And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last November , for had it been otherwise , I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace .	5.155217978387062
' Are any of your younger sisters out , Miss Bennet ?	53.93759540895025
Multiple superscripted characters are enclosed by curly brackets ( example : M rs ) .	29.54241929447434
she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not to believe it , and could not help saying so .	5.2014118084762755
He should be particularly happy at any time , c .	68.88161428751268
The perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing , or on the evenness of his lines , or on the length of his letter , with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received , formed a curious dialogue , and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each .	3.30275058615593

If he wants our society , let him seek it .	69.00114822595985
As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their aunt , and all Collins's scruples of leaving and Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted , the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton ;	3.5048361586478287

With respect to Wickham , the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation ;	17.302611745612513
It did .	4744.62112948688
He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her ;	44.729444366769016
CHAPTER XIII .	4138.577761074046
They battled it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved .	11.7997458213718
but really considering his descent , one could not expect much better .	43.03884381625645
After a short pause , her companion added , You are too generous to trifle with me .	19.980069485917912
They can only wish his happiness , and if he is attached to me , no other woman can secure it .	13.816309586978225
I admire the activity of your benevolence , observed Mary , but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason ;	12.600219577042024
I hope you saw her petticoat , six inches deep in mud , I am absolutely certain ;	19.016906329511905
They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time , and though I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions , I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible .	3.9612697903361274
I thought I should have died .	283.4146564303774
and , before Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt , of which her daughter sat in momentary dread , Bingley , who wanted to be alone with Jane , proposed their all walking out .	4.425525891315922
It needed all Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity .	35.308098707836045
You alluded to something else .	471.6466798211475
He promises fairly , and I hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent .	8.218299210675
and indeed , before we left Bakewell , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country .	15.464146086740598
and on these occasions , Gardiner , rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's warm commendation of him , narrowly observed them both .	13.543317590126108
Respect , esteem , and confidence , had vanished for ever ;	53.69533281330631
and he went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town .	22.99292597137038
Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly ;	282.46925075992857
Those to her mother , contained little else , than that they were just returned from the library , where such and such officers had attended them , and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild ;	4.4879544859094676
but would my giving you the wished-for promise , make their marriage at all more probable ?	21.71676006523128
Nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the United States .	20.372238228522345
But I hope you will get over it , and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood .	9.504850325205943
The recollection of what I then said , of my conduct , my manners , my expressions during the whole of it , is now , and has been many months , inexpressibly painful to me .	5.097940755647428
Aye , no doubt ;	878.2287942620416
She said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence ;	22.411817576399095
We cannot suppose he would help it , if he could .	53.7159705188591
I am the happiest creature in the world .	126.58942695393142
and then you must stay all night .	183.24555770392564
How could he spare half ten thousand pounds ?	126.54256907873312
Perhaps by and bye I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones .	21.733775991790566
Though Elizabeth would not , for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine , have answered this question ;	16.82164476263414
What you ask , said Elizabeth , is no sacrifice on my side ;	41.452800217868464
She was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ;	55.9583169005336
I must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from declaring my amazement , at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married .	5.173583372279895
to the young ladies he certainly was nothing ;	126.44169118455625
Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort , much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements .	8.885356881459405
and how Lydia could ever have attached him , had appeared incomprehensible .	43.03701690971076
My uncle is to send a servant for us .	91.34839961648215
I see the imprudence of it .	283.81012564781116
Books Oh !	4743.677376410631
I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well and indeed so I do still at my heart ;	11.228657208683504
Scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning , but their visit to Rosings .	17.294763648772197
I was ready to die of laughter .	183.1276132111486
I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible .	10.059823250920072
CHAPTER XXII .	4747.787542098787
but consider how much it must increase his disappointment .	91.334049870353
Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall ;	14.264892581370335
Elizabeth's courage did not fail her .	283.17255396333
and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations .	9.72817428077286
is not there a little mistake ?	282.32115989635025
The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends ;	12.281251562774058
Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above-mentioned ;	43.065538461684
We have not met since the 26th of November , when we were all dancing together at Netherfield .	16.835300983580378
Are you not diverted ?	878.6958929468948
The communication excited many professions of concern ;	182.92503594593404
He came to tell Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both , Wickham repeatedly , Lydia once .	5.778463656883702
each of them deep in thought .	282.32115989634974
You saw me dance at Meryton , I believe , Yes , indeed , and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight .	12.578901273060142
Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother , but remained quietly in the hall , till she and Kitty were out of sight , then returned into the drawing-room .	6.49529588058894
and as she walked up and down the room , endeavouring to compose herself , saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt , as made every thing worse .	6.596427105416571
With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family , and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton , sometimes dirty and sometimes cold , did January and February pass away .	5.531806721026038
Darcy smiled ;	4747.039936628035
but to speak with such civility , to enquire after her family !	43.22221559317379
and Sir William , to Elizabeth's high diversion , was stationed in the doorway , in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him , and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that way .	5.435368239738689
Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship .	36.620759639580555
A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued , on either side calm and concise and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister , just returned from their walk .	5.539202885116022
Could I expect it to be otherwise !	183.4738460516449
and soon laying it wholly aside , she drew near the card-table , and stationed herself between Bingley and his eldest sister , to observe the game .	7.948931495873319
To and Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself .	35.31856060239264
I do , I do like him , she replied , with tears in her eyes , I love him .	14.88643214180151
Yes , she will do for him very well .	91.4363844262028
and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again .	19.586628366045478
To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted , than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement .	12.283876498965272
But if we do not venture , somebody else will ;	69.02039112895456
The invitation was accepted of course , and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine's drawing-room .	13.524978223492045
It has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling .	53.86761722437804
and she read it again .	471.8945578575712
It is impossible that he should still love me .	91.36764259938172
but though he was now established only as a tenant , Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table , nor was Hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her .	3.3548009566463666
The eldest of them , a sensible , intelligent young woman , about twenty-seven , was Elizabeth's intimate friend .	15.010046494723772
Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding , and made no answer .	26.050969443007112
Her carriage remained at the door , and Elizabeth saw that her waiting-woman was in it .	24.001228693559774
In this quiet way , the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away .	29.641238688600993
but at last on Bennet's leaving them together , after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master , she could not help saying , Oh !	8.24332868716192
I rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it would happen .	26.86003793983667
and it was settled that Jones should be sent for early in the morning , if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better .	12.425816177973084
Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's meditated elopement .	43.24699190026634
I knew you would be wishing me joy .	126.44705478121537
His letter was soon dispatched ;	471.7859605297108
do we ?	4789.27318344388
To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying .	126.83385391335165
We dine at Rosings twice every week , and are never allowed to walk home .	25.151269856262452
I do not know who is good enough for him .	71.69951983913009
But Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on , in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice .	4.734106450471702
Then , perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying , she added , Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson ;	7.113631695252842
These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship , and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay .	8.200550717312831
Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit .	91.42799757034444
and were informed that it was but just done , to give pleasure to Miss Darcy , who had taken a liking to the room , when last at Pemberley .	7.029077589264558
but why did not you tell me so before ?	91.334049870353
To walk three miles , or four miles , or five miles , or whatever it is , above her ancles in dirt , and alone , quite alone !	6.9237995054907495
But , my dearest Jane , you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday , or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend .	2.635644348502525
'Tis an etiquette I despise , said he .	126.07739456675078
This part of his intelligence , though unheard by Lydia , was caught by Elizabeth , and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make .	2.425447406005523
Well , my dear , said Bennet , when Elizabeth had read the note aloud , if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness , if she should die , it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Bingley , and under your orders .	3.725305871929043
At least , you should not remind your Mother of inviting him .	43.06094703847179
Allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not disgrace you , and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear Miss Eliza , ( glancing at her sister and Bingley , ) shall take place .	3.6433835276336817
but as I have actually paid the visit , we cannot escape the acquaintance now .	25.199911504270606
She is not such a simpleton .	282.667329923674
I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs , absurd and impertinent .	14.299566445458764
but he had something to direct his search , which was more than we had ;	26.022822949261563
There he had talked to her friends , when he could not to herself .	29.551080352454075
His circumstances , he assured me , and I had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad .	16.31441123010263
My father was not only fond of this young man's society , whose manners were always engaging ;	19.61412802440638
Oh !	8965.45062507954
for mine is totally different .	471.7825833880573
It was the second week in May , in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch-street , for the town of in Hertfordshire ;	8.502752067765469
If there were but such another man for you !	91.81773922696156
Pray make my excuses to Pratt , for not keeping my engagement , and dancing with him to-night .	16.825315119119253
If I have wounded your sister's feelings , it was unknowingly done ;	43.10612154136675
Bingley followed his advice .	873.5981421247219
and after all , Long and her nieces must stand their chance ;	43.11524087954165
She declared her resolution .	872.8639835499257
He made no answer .	876.9082712107097
and really , all things considered , I begin to think it perfectly reasonable .	31.211454467026766
Promise me , therefore , to come to Hunsford .	104.90610021233914
and so generous , that you will always exceed your income .	56.082593314364885
We must not all expect Jane's good fortune .	126.7008588108492
and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued , I remember , when we first knew her in Hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ;	5.03649081958639
I beg you will not go .	300.68635392933044
A report of a most alarming nature , reached me two days ago .	35.318018276957545
His affection was proved to have been sincere , and his conduct cleared of all blame , unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend .	6.68866718997753
No ;	13601.676459159366
Yes , yes .	1855.8024402471776
She is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else .	43.14916544681985
whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish .	12.280591974049722
and , in my opinion , exertion should always be in proportion to what is required .	22.499070014540887
Did you speak from your own observation , said she , when you told him that my sister loved him , or merely from my information last spring ?	8.112595785169948
The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation .	68.88060192205867
Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight , but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction .	8.119837436483145
Any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn , I suppose , would appear far .	29.130618556607274
I want to talk very seriously .	282.3351318639557
Who are your uncles and aunts ?	283.17255396333
This was agreed to , and Philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets , and a little bit of hot supper afterwards .	7.294120309654732
A man of honour could not have doubted the intention , but Darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation , and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance , imprudence , in short any thing or nothing .	3.4305729068649677
Where does discretion end , and avarice begin ?	126.7684574716793
and , allowing for the loss of Sir William , and there being only one card table in the evening , every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first .	6.952219333565351
When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over , he naturally returned to all his former indolence .	9.097734506073634
CHAPTER IX .	4138.577761074046
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her sister , and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case , was almost incredible !	4.24700764654739
He saw Wickham , and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia .	68.88161428751268
Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them .	53.73474210519279
You know I have .	875.7860848562306
It will then be publicly seen , that on both sides , we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance .	13.548895123746377
He wrote last week to hurry my return .	126.09257234873176
Jane then took it from her pocket-book , and gave it to Elizabeth .	35.322606185092724
There is but such a quantity of merit between them ;	68.96527985521826
As she spoke , she observed him looking at her earnestly , and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness , convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth .	3.833740765790737
Well , and so we breakfasted at ten as usual ;	68.97464510774208
Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her .	284.1273713928716
And this is your real opinion !	283.860204961342
and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her , was still more strange .	19.047577931126494
She felt that she had no business at Pemberley , and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it .	14.519285911715512
but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it ;	37.455915912861364
and he soon afterwards said aloud , Bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day ?	9.786064215681524
Before Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise , Bennet instantly answered , Oh dear !	15.009175861060113
and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her , was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held .	7.0660695496361265
And you saw him frequently ?	474.3665019244709
DEAR SIR , The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father , always gave me much uneasiness , and since I have had the misfortune to lose him , I have frequently wished to heal the breach ;	4.573209918098015
No , I should have turned in a moment .	103.61429431291766
Could he , or the Lucases , have pitched on any man , within the circle of our acquaintance , whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related ?	5.7955630859598015
we talked and laughed so loud , that any body might have heard us ten miles off !	19.047124592951477
and , on the father's , from respectable , honourable , and ancient , though untitled families .	19.003846382258853
She was now , on being settled at home , at leisure to observe the real state of her sister's spirits .	12.28451765982937
so , it will be impossible for her to introduce him , for she will not know him herself .	16.59749270204305
What think you of this sentence , my dear Lizzy ?	73.79494222511998
Jane's is nothing to it nothing at all .	126.64175158863814
How could she deny that credit to his assertions , in one instance , which she had been obliged to give in the other ?	10.745223041360449
I dare say the lace upon Hurst's gown Here she was interrupted again .	35.53939336260981
and Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn , nothing remained to be done but to go ;	16.31135182428359
Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible .	126.16695397791044
and there is no occasion for talking to him , except just now and then .	26.494528646814004
I dearly love a laugh .	471.5869008114699
but without much success .	872.8690062597083
They saw him often , and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve .	18.99817679546532
said he , with a look of doubt .	140.7309020409081
Poor Eliza !	4767.690094325646
Speak to Lizzy about it yourself .	282.32115989634974
Not at all , was her answer ;	195.38106041462248
The same anxiety to get them by themselves , was visible again in the evening .	26.083881701410217
But he is an ugly fellow !	283.42900187763144
Yes , yes , they must marry .	183.15959188304265
Thursday was to be the wedding day , and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit ;	18.995413237366122
and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future ;	7.3443401521480105
but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at .	68.99828312421735
Remember that she is one of a large family ;	95.64525075053155
They called at various times of the morning , sometimes separately , sometimes together , and now and then accompanied by their aunt .	10.837061208930194
Bingley , his two sisters , the husband of the eldest , and another young man .	22.42038397166074
Intimate as you are , you must know how it is to be done .	33.45069304427056
My father supported him at school , and afterwards at Cambridge ;	53.83468601366728
for when supper was over , singing was talked of , and she had the mortification of seeing Mary , after very little entreaty , preparing to oblige the company .	6.895916679535885
and their conversation , which had been passing while and Gardiner were engaged with their children , was now put an end to , by the approach of the whole party .	7.01090757863675
But Georgiana would not join her .	282.34942266949554
With respect to that other , more weighty accusation , of having injured Wickham , I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family .	6.277821233967132
Yet the misery , for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation , received soon afterwards material relief , from observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her former lover .	4.834330919873797
Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile .	182.93276980679664
It distressed her a little , and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage .	12.055235228546353
But I have other provocations .	471.9853558533028
He studies too much for words of four syllables .	91.3363258970804
From their infancy , they have been intended for each other .	53.75728472651946
he had all the best part of beauty , a fine countenance , a good figure , and very pleasing address .	12.627163243397847
and she asked Bingley , whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present .	19.58320095830262
They followed her into the dining-parlour .	282.3998896388649
and after some contrivance , the whole party , with all their boxes , workbags , and parcels , and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's and Lydia's purchases , were seated in it .	5.681264282467652
On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls , whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room , and whose shyness , as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth , prevented their coming lower .	3.9960898454672873
but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour .	46.555467997706785
and on his return , brought back , with great satisfaction , a message from her Ladyship , importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her .	4.793401568568789
I have no reason , I assure you , said he , to be dissatisfied with my reception .	21.36684825988686
In essentials , I believe , he is very much what he ever was .	34.14304068391044
Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday ;	126.07739456675078
and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there ;	18.995865344765782
and they soon became sensible , that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old , and whose own manners indicated respectability , was not to be hastily rejected .	5.361734222550109
Bromley , of course .	872.7545377705296
Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth , where confidence would give pleasure ;	36.635019187855185
What congratulations will then flow in !	282.4502899266855
My dear Bennet , said his lady to him one day , have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last ?	11.579612090843447
His countenance rather gained in austerity ;	282.44437404839834
The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family , connections , or fortune .	29.544561385042407
I do not know of any other designs that he had formed : but he was in such a hurry to be gone , and his spirits so greatly discomposed , that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this .	4.289774752193226
He has always something to say to every body .	95.81821207497994
but there were two or three much uglier in the shop ;	53.89735205524161
If he wishes to avoid seeing me , he must go .	53.788359524269545
Have you not heard me say , that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ?	16.867834333833937
and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before , was now high in her good graces .	12.402402189704866
she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ;	68.91482029193998
Bennet , you are wanted immediately ;	283.23972365900374
My real purpose was to see you , and to judge , if I could , whether I might ever hope to make you love me .	8.481755604812799
Oh !	8965.45062507954
He made a little mistake to be sure ;	126.09257234873155
This event had at last been despaired of , but it was then too late to be saving .	17.97262313631512
On this subject , what can you have to say ?	68.91980248528974
But will they make you happy ?	282.34942266949554
She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment ;	126.18678989417538
There could be no conversation in the noise of Philips's supper party , but his manners recommended him to every body .	12.602678610866757
An union of a different tendency , and precluding the possibility of the other , was soon to be formed in their family .	10.59660846786683
Yes ;	11559.025432404986
Elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ;	35.34156353171324
Did you see him while you were at Lambton ?	91.89017922045322
I do comprehend a great deal in it .	132.57373582770143
Did she call to refuse her consent ?	183.32496412747892
They must have seen them together for ever .	126.10752998249735
With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew ;	183.05789101355145
I am sure my sisters must all envy me .	91.47637228652476
I hope we may often meet again .	183.2709417074034
There was not much in the question , nor in the preceding remark , but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning .	8.673387883996739
She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of Darcy's sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , she turned up the lane , which led her farther from the turnpike road .	4.28752198905747
His sister was less delicate , and directed her eye towards Darcy with a very expressive smile .	18.999738116764487
Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend .	37.53699204173331
I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Bingley .	25.176439100064837
Bingley is most unaffectedly modest .	471.97579738545653
With a renewal of tenderness , however , they repaired to her room on leaving the dining-parlour , and sat with her till summoned to coffee .	8.315608804860853
Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment .	3.003678641767033
With a glance she saw , that he had lost none of his recent civility ;	27.66852952790832
Would Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it ?	13.524223900860871
But above all , above respect and esteem , there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked .	11.254646672279897
There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others .	17.365264672604887
And as I come back , I can call on Lady Lucas and Long .	29.546424213635913
She will be down in a moment I dare say .	69.38494978251396
There is nothing he would not do for her .	91.83669388729537
and for your own , let her be an active , useful sort of person , not brought up high , but able to make a small income go a good way .	6.051277593989788
Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed .	35.34736681177681
The dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last ;	53.69991330566006
At length , in a voice of forced calmness , he said , And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting !	8.067593890291079
she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld !	91.38329286713865
The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton ;	68.88060192205867
Very odd !	4761.404895261674
Her teeth are tolerable , but not out of the common way ;	43.046570027904586
They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in ;	43.12194464852301
but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable , they are not , I hope , quite so easily changed as that implies .	7.252978336533711
[ Illustration : DOVE-DALE ] PRIDE PREJUDICE .	182.9046321206164
Lady Catherine is a very respectable , sensible woman indeed , added Charlotte , and a most attentive neighbour .	15.445165652205654
and as for Hurst , by whom Elizabeth sat , he was an indolent man , who lived only to eat , drink , and play at cards , who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout , had nothing to say to her .	3.6899175957270365
and when Bingley was gone , Jane constantly sought the same means of relief .	30.610666992311753
and the kind of half-expectation which Gardiner had formed , of their being followed by a letter from him , had ended in nothing .	10.527142636440104
She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter .	68.9115167527982
After wandering along the lane for two hours , giving way to every variety of thought ;	21.72621569355413
and such I might still have been but for you , dearest , loveliest Elizabeth !	25.144102465350898
Much had been done , and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday ;	19.058722096418784
And his behaviour , so strikingly altered , what could it mean ?	43.04219051738933
My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking .	29.56627030745051
It was gratitude .	1853.3603356325973
One morning , about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been formed , as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining-room , their attention was suddenly drawn to the window , by the sound of a carriage ;	3.8263247151451223
Certainly , he replied , biting his lips .	145.4257626173175
I honour your circumspection .	872.8063687780879
and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general , he can have no objection , I am sure , to oblige us for one half hour .	9.010784583615287
Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these .	95.83571645017619
He is gone to my father already .	183.17604640164097
When the ladies were separating for the toilette , he said to Elizabeth , Do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your apparel .	8.580617716194201
He bore it with noble indifference , and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy , had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Darcy , with an expression of half-laughing alarm .	4.759152828826826
and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery .	9.21791366355399
and Wickham had constant admission to the house .	126.08232441121416
and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly commendable , and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate , will be kindly overlooked on your side , and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch .	3.5232699658482924
she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood , nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two , to visit his relations .	5.988743233905378
but she had not got beyond the words delightful , and charming , when some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her , might be mischievously construed .	5.6899895373426785
Very well and this offer of marriage you have refused ?	69.00293396125757
My dear Hill , have you heard the good news ?	71.99627938473795
They crossed it by a simple bridge , in character with the general air of the scene ;	18.99817679546532
You appear to me , Darcy , to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection .	19.578280550128195
Well , and so just as the carriage came to the door , my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Stone .	9.093093655232131
In my opinion , the younger son of an Earl can know very little of either .	23.132342237879868
and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification .	41.14729416720158
Had you then persuaded yourself that I should ?	126.2089079062771
and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling .	8.548031390508262
that if he is so , you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me .	13.532525249050423
and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night , she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon .	6.964665680840259
I do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Darcy .	13.86296581068449
Had she merely dined with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ;	17.869256931743124
but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him .	18.996496412417027
dear Lizzy , only consider what he must have suffered .	71.92368775476572
I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure .	53.777548047005325
That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side , too , was another very welcome surprise ;	13.893047110825874
In spite of having been at James's , Sir William was so completely awed , by the grandeur surrounding him , that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow , and take his seat without saying a word ;	4.2516788440244415
my dear , cried his wife , I cannot bear to hear that mentioned .	36.103610392214506
You can now have nothing farther to say , she resentfully answered .	44.73019698108344
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States .	11.229000596766417
How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year !	28.364098544352935
Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Philips , and she ventured , without any permission , to do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton .	7.791063209445083
Her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour : his judgment could not err , and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth , as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable .	4.287149165251434
and he found in Philips a very attentive listener , whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard , and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could .	5.207525897196476
When Lydia went away , she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and Kitty ;	15.869038308825795
It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom .	25.15162296238808
Their eyes instantly met , and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush .	21.72778012462641
Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed , as to leave her very little attention for her book ;	15.438696899298511
She was even sensible of some pleasure , though mixed with regret , on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Darcy and herself .	5.43646659198783
and she was more grieved than astonished to hear , in reply to her minute enquiries , that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits , there were periods of dejection .	6.057635954882807
And may I ask ?	872.9911838121304
In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure , said Bingley ;	39.862718806981746
and more than once during dinner did Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth , I am glad you are come back , Lizzy .	12.761723638762794
your father of course may spare you , if your mother can .	43.035708093730584
and of late it has been shifting about pretty much .	68.87671581652873
its solace was visiting and news .	282.32115989634974
Have you seen any pleasant men ?	284.52383511366696
But Bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own .	16.80325631148604
Elizabeth hesitated , but her knees trembled under her , and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them .	9.78049092047514
You have only proved by this , cried Elizabeth , that Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition .	14.50113155797672
but I believe we must abide by our original plan .	68.93371991666689
for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health , and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight .	6.364526832853878
That is all to be forgot .	284.6405773007988
and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Bennet's being quite unable to sit alone .	16.830761636542846
You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night .	36.66083289303559
Yes , I really believe Darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care .	15.442322807901187
She is up stairs , and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all .	29.564148151690212
With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added , How long did you say that he was at Rosings ?	13.529888802704605
People did say , you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas ;	35.3051414270065
She put down the letter , weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality deliberated on the probability of each statement but with little success .	7.783876405428533
Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing , after all .	53.69533281330631
But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side , said Jane .	30.59934907524739
Implacable resentment is a shade in a character .	126.07739456675078
FITZWILLIAM DARCY .	4743.677376410631
Your reproof , so well applied , I shall never forget : 'had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner .	13.894933944235273
at first .	4743.677376410631
The letter shall certainly be burnt , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard ;	16.857096681535253
And there is something of dignity in his countenance , that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart .	12.316685813460694
Oh !	8965.45062507954
Her father , contented with laughing at them , would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters ;	11.255347576773785
Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow , and sat down again to her work , with an eagerness which it did not often command .	7.6331089190715105
and , alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother , we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London .	8.888283438275353
to the last .	1860.4034109326622
Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt , and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description , when Hurst called them to order , with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward .	3.7297001652927397
Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea , and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies .	6.423684383914239
And you only the second .	474.3665019244709
Philips was always glad to see her nieces , and the two eldest , from their recent absence , were particularly welcome , and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home , which , as their own carriage had not fetched them , she should have known nothing about , if she had not happened to see Jones's shop boy in the street , who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away , when her civility was claimed towards Collins by Jane's introduction of him .	1.9393040600291718
What a letter is this , to be written at such a moment .	35.39050007085999
for though the chief of his concerns , with the son of his patron , were imperfectly understood , it was yet a well known fact that , on his quitting Derbyshire , he had left many debts behind him , which Darcy afterwards discharged .	3.881744892552927
There are few people whom I really love , and still fewer of whom I think well .	19.051980251814616
His debts to be discharged , and something still to remain !	53.71187367601594
and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino , the two girls had the honour of assisting Jenkinson to make up her party .	9.41814833336251
It soothed , but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self-attracted by the rest of her family ;	10.988979522776393
But your family owe me nothing .	282.34942266949554
Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad ?	56.05619703083221
Oh !	8965.45062507954

Even Elizabeth began to fear not that Bingley was indifferent but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away .	12.280591974049722
The satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her husband , might then have rested in its proper place .	7.790193809881316
and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs , to think of any thing else .	8.788101284897973
but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line .	36.619433126121415
I believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as I do .	37.531196937174364
The party seemed so well selected , so suitable one with the other .	35.307836105462044
But when they see , as I trust they will , that their brother is happy with me , they will learn to be contented , and we shall be on good terms again ;	5.7312835538191775
Do let us have a little music , cried Miss Bingley , tired of a conversation in which she had no share .	11.514327240107802
She answered in the affirmative , and , unable to resist the temptation , added , When you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance .	5.955163085166502
It was not known that Wickham had a single relation , with whom he kept up any connection , and it was certain that he had no near one living .	7.396366873051167
and Elizabeth , after all the misery of the morning , found herself , in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed , seated in the carriage , and on the road to Longbourn .	5.322210961228638
It is every way horrible !	471.8542217062196
cried Miss Bingley , Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable .	44.756258170334306
and the other , that she herself had been barbarously used by them all ;	29.559843869307986
The usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter .	43.03917530227505
It is unaccountable !	1853.4777041522884
Bennet made no answer , and each of them , deep in thought , continued silent till they reached the house .	13.671371909822117
The others have been gone on to Scarborough , these three weeks .	43.03917530227505
I am not likely to leave Kent for some time .	68.99299920031112
I am thinking of what you have been telling me , said she .	36.77218857305579
he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen !	71.97977614000226
I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals , but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them .	11.476609075186701
About a month , said Elizabeth ;	285.61172831246864
She could think of nothing more to say ;	136.2275238787457
I am very glad you liked her .	183.7047193565147
He called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil , which had been brought on by himself .	8.777460522319473
You are all kindness , Madam ;	282.6726651895664
She will follow wherever Lydia leads .	283.3027089153531
What a contrast between him and his friend !	126.49126052535027
Ah !	13586.708929614973
indeed you have no reason .	471.56144177488665
In her own past behaviour , there was a constant source of vexation and regret ;	29.25750372109724
If I may so express it , he has a right to be proud .	29.58591833866237
Only think of its being three months , she cried , since I went away ;	26.939371695427745
if the first , I should be completely in your way ;	57.45833876427634
He was as generous , she doubted not , as the most generous of his sex .	21.728232712652954
And this , cried Darcy , as he walked with quick steps across the room , is your opinion of me !	12.630424033563052
If I , said Collins , were so fortunate as to be able to sing , I should have great pleasure , I am sure , in obliging the company with an air ;	7.046069745973912
and Lydia , in a voice rather louder than any other person's , was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her .	7.478751190705145
She seems perfectly happy , however , and in a prudential light , it is certainly a very good match for her .	12.64801224816938
E1 .	14526.116811011168
Invented by M rs Bell 26 Charlotte Street Bedford Square .	68.87435935390347
and had some new extracts to admire , and some new observations of thread-bare morality to listen to .	16.846632516135365
True , said Bennet , but it is a comfort to think that , whatever of that kind may befal you , you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it .	6.295493232052738
certainly , said Elizabeth , though burning with curiosity ;	111.87748546086456
or , with a mind so occupied , she might have forgotten where she was .	27.181712122905804
Oh !	8965.45062507954
Regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure , but I wrote to Wickham , who left the place immediately , and Younge was of course removed from her charge .	5.778213961003828
I know it cannot be long .	282.74932142875343
My beauty you had early withstood , and as for my manners my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not .	4.424896670021331
But there was still something lurking behind , of which prudence forbad the disclosure .	29.622392194308567
These were the contents : MY DEAR HARRIET , You will laugh when you know where I am gone , and I cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning , as soon as I am missed .	5.052979820747896
and every body began to find out , that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness .	18.995087390517845
But I ought to beg his pardon , for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant .	12.604555843269605
With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted !	68.92124585403512
She had high animal spirits , and a sort of natural self-consequence , which the attentions of the officers , to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her , had increased into assurance .	4.779121647499586
but unable to contain herself , began scolding one of her daughters .	43.03884381625645
Heaven forbid !	4349.971333827082
and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again .	29.543227901560055
Colonel Forster came yesterday , having left Brighton the day before , not many hours after the express .	17.859698122770332
Not a word , however , passed his lips in allusion to it , till their visitor took his leave for the night ;	10.361458849025697
It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Darcy than they had before any idea of ;	16.80679679160144
I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude .	30.72552505322638
but now , as soon as they were alone together , she said , I saw you look at me to-day , Lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present report ;	6.390942676301842
Lydia was Lydia still ;	881.6972300313372
I should have considered it as part of my duty , and the exertion would soon have been nothing .	15.022020412138463
I was very uncomfortable , I may say unhappy .	91.42254854101864
And your assurance of it , I suppose , carried immediate conviction to him .	33.30999466925436
and Mary , at the end of a long concerto , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs , at the request of her younger sisters , who with some of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room .	3.391014755585197
though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them .	7.349623445915695
To work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures ;	43.05297452193775
He could even listen to Sir William Lucas , when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country , and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at James's , with very decent composure .	4.650829449702516
and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own .	7.030817190793945
and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and at first was resolved not to break it ;	8.887583594454192
Her mind was less difficult to develope .	182.96855453179248
Oh !	8965.45062507954
that of Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest ;	183.12923961618722
Instead of viewing them as a stranger , I might have rejoiced in them as my own , and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt .	7.724227754045183
and as Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her's , it was performed in a proper manner , without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary .	4.5046575314273944
was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room , and from all the others when they sat down to table .	9.16385565322623
his sisters declared that they were miserable .	183.41372786452467
It had not been very great ;	283.60529457653064
You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary , compressed , marked up , nonproprietary or proprietary form , including any word processing or hypertext form .	6.926878169480754
And so , my dear sister , I find from our uncle and aunt , that you have actually seen Pemberley .	14.970105066704974
The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week ;	43.03917530227505
I do , indeed , replied Elizabeth , colouring .	104.04747161732497
A person may be proud without being vain .	126.13980579834178
For the truth of every thing here related , I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam , who from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the executors of my father's will , has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions .	3.303707541155358
I shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his constancy .	35.335903945849616
I should never have said Collins was settled near her family .	53.76292198703658
Wretched , wretched , mistake !	471.56144177488665
Those who do not complain are never pitied .	126.76845747167953
Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete , old , middle-aged and new computers .	5.014324185245833
How differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned !	43.049491474814225
Elizabeth , you are not serious now .	193.212553328633
All this was acknowledged to Gardiner ;	282.8783856271088
What a fine thing for our girls !	183.55130796912513
You did !	4744.856414297252
No man of common humanity , no man who had any value for his character , could be capable of it .	12.28409797726871
but at length was reduced to be reasonable .	126.78033343557111
It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Bingley to see you all after him so soon ;	16.83183521473772
An excellent consolation in its way , said Elizabeth , but it will not do for us .	23.07691680655731
Nothing had ever suggested it before , but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter , than by supposing a partiality for their niece .	5.397911806995018
But , he added , you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them , with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here .	5.9456148937951125
Is there one among the sex , who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman ?	10.337896925019146
At length , she spoke again .	284.50537586103917
and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement .	126.14736689527284
See <URL> Transcriber's note : Text enclosed by underscores is in italics ( italics ) .	25.14344703474128
I have just as much right to be asked as she has , and more too , for I am two years older .	10.991227200247842
he shook his head when I expressed my hopes , and said he feared W was not a man to be trusted .	11.514978676795288
My dear Lizzy , where can you have been walking to ?	54.23241692444867
After a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner , and thus began , In vain have I struggled .	9.576797853330476
But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault because I would not take the trouble of practising .	12.600503030184854
and , of course , I could not rest till I knew the particulars .	33.467771878973195
That lady I suppose is your mother .	182.99484817284574
and on their being seated , a pause , awkward as such pauses must always be , succeeded for a few moments .	11.813802354995563
From the former .	1871.9605560913349
There was one part especially , the opening of it , which I should dread your having the power of reading again .	12.105056121219908
They came .	4745.6617894860765
and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed .	4.316917539023842
Wickham is safe .	1855.5187480789534
and Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem .	29.65648879102379
Many stared .	4775.128987276426
