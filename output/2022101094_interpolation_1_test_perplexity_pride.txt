Average perplexity: 17407.891101242494
I am not at all afraid of her dying .	15559.850453513078
and so accomplished !	40851.30742983926
but without scheming to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery .	9916.958575084616
She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest , by talking of their supposed marriage , and planning his happiness in such an alliance .	9547.944950839816
Hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was very glad ;	12101.48344089954
I told you in the library , you know , that I should never speak to you again , and you will find me as good as my word .	9260.379464816695
The house , furniture , neighbourhood , and roads , were all to her taste , and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most friendly and obliging .	9660.348753098539
and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle directly .	11380.291625061673
If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection , Elizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty .	10407.310844156898
My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness , and in a cause of such moment as this , I shall certainly not depart from it .	9260.379464816695
The pain of separation , however , might be alleviated on his side , by preparations for the reception of his bride , as he had reason to hope , that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire , the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men .	8175.953084916759
No , I thank you ;	24639.09342595445
I have suspected it some time , but I am now convinced .	13096.286853076666
Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again , and weakened her disgust of Collins .	11380.291625061673
It was unpardonable .	40851.30742983926
No , said Colonel Fitzwilliam , that is an advantage which he must divide with me .	11380.291625061673
and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the probability of a rainy season , made her feel that the commonest , dullest , most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker .	8152.499297932932
Their visitors staid with them above half an hour , and when they arose to depart , Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing and Gardiner , and Miss Bennet , to dinner at Pemberley , before they left the country .	8308.54672257218
But upon my honour I do not .	18605.234516800505
She blushed , and Jane blushed ;	21038.055088401863
I promised them so faithfully !	24639.09342595445
which are naturally lively enough .	24639.09342595445
It was a subject , in short , on which reflection would be long indulged , and must be unavailing .	10407.310844156898
The rooms were lofty and handsome , and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor ;	11089.641563468356
and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour Lady Lucas .	11380.291625061673
but Darcy , at whom it was all aimed , was still inflexibly studious .	12101.48344089954
What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosing's Park , when he put his letter into her hand !	10064.285584582429
Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas , for Collins was only a clergyman ;	11380.291625061673
The Collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave ;	12101.48344089954
Do you consider the forms of introduction , and the stress that is laid on them , as nonsense ?	10608.549258458432
As for Jane , her anxiety under this suspence was , of course , more painful than Elizabeth's ;	10834.408731294176
Indeed !	132911.3833977684
and I particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at Netherfield , '_She a beauty !	10407.310844156898
I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well , I assure you .	12555.954772759242
and , perhaps , if I have very good luck , I may meet with another Collins in time .	10608.549258458432
From herself to Jane from Jane to Bingley , her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Darcy's explanation there , had appeared very insufficient ;	9178.14939037836
My father , however , is partial to Wickham .	15559.850453513078
The dejection was almost universal .	24639.09342595445
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper ;	9547.944950839816
But in spite of all this fine talking , my dear Lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured , that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair .	8593.376018081019
No why should he ?	30417.036999547854
As Gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she and her children should go to London , at the same time that Bennet came from it .	9030.07563000038
Yet , how just a humiliation !	21038.055088401863
Nay , when I read a letter of his , I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham , much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law .	9030.07563000038
Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ?	15559.850453513078
Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and which he thought the prettiest ?	8963.182761163067
In the afternoon , the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves ;	10608.549258458432
He has children of his own , and may have more .	13748.703918533663
Family pride , and filial pride , for he is very proud of what his father was , have done this .	10226.907161276042
It was to this effect : Since writing the above , dearest Lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ;	9782.87932956929
Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield , which was fixed for the following Tuesday .	9660.348753098539
This was his plan of amends of atonement for inheriting their father's estate ;	12555.954772759242
and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached .	8963.182761163067
If you will thank me , he replied , let it be for yourself alone .	11714.159730430352
I hope he will overlook it .	21038.055088401863
Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her .	18605.234516800505
that he should have been in love with her for so many months !	12555.954772759242
She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting .	13748.703918533663
and as she considered that Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations , and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct , she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before .	8370.035361590719
Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again ?	12555.954772759242
She was ashamed to think how much .	18605.234516800505
Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends ?	13748.703918533663
She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference .	12101.48344089954
1813 .	132911.3833977684
Do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart .	9660.348753098539
and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer !	12101.48344089954
Did you , on reading it , give any credit to its contents ?	12555.954772759242
When tea was over , Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table but in vain .	11714.159730430352
Yes , he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word .	13748.703918533663
and Elizabeth found , that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations' consent , there was still something to be wished for .	9178.14939037836
and neither the carriage , nor the livery of the servant who preceded it , were familiar to them .	10608.549258458432
Oh , well !	40851.30742983926
for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ;	13096.286853076666
Is nothing due to me on that score ?	16863.15364986961
but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter and said , Jane , I congratulate you .	10226.907161276042
Bennet's best comfort was , that Bingley must be down again in the summer .	12101.48344089954
and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , I never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them .	9916.958575084616
The park paling was still the boundary on one side , and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground .	10064.285584582429
Jane certainly could not come back .	21038.055088401863
To the civil enquiries which then poured in , and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Bingley's , she could not make a very favourable answer .	8963.182761163067
He begged pardon for having displeased her .	18605.234516800505
But she is nothing to me now .	18605.234516800505
Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time .	9782.87932956929
Miss Darcy , on her brother's entrance , exerted herself much more to talk ;	12101.48344089954
He made no answer , and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton .	8900.461224119532
the nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people !	14551.04788507868
If , indeed , it should be so !	16863.15364986961
I cannot fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation .	9916.958575084616
He had rather hoped that all his wife's views on the stranger would be disappointed ;	11714.159730430352
CHAPTER XVI .	63582.78435607402
Her report was highly favourable .	24639.09342595445
Every body said how well she looked ;	18605.234516800505
He seemed scarcely to hear her , and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation ;	10834.408731294176
They were now almost at the door of the house , for she had walked fast to get rid of him ;	10226.907161276042
He is so excessively handsome !	24639.09342595445
for Long has just been here , and she told me all about it .	12101.48344089954
where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure ;	12555.954772759242
Darcy , after enquiring of her how and Gardiner did , a question which she could not answer without confusion , said scarcely any thing .	9660.348753098539
They gradually ascended for half a mile , and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence , where the wood ceased , and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House , situated on the opposite side of a valley , into which the road with some abruptness wound .	8200.346801832206
He was too happy , however , to need much attention ;	13748.703918533663
Why Jane you never dropt a word of this ;	15559.850453513078
It was all pride and insolence .	21038.055088401863
How does Georgiana get on , Darcy ?	18605.234516800505
At such a distance as that , you know , things are strangely misrepresented .	12101.48344089954
and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted .	12555.954772759242
We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured .	13748.703918533663
pray make haste and come into the dining-room , for there is such a sight to be seen !	10834.408731294176
When they were gone , Elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent .	8551.377728427238
My dear Eliza he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way .	9916.958575084616
Her ease and good spirits increased .	21038.055088401863
Elizabeth , who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Darcy had been , was much relieved by discerning such different feelings .	9260.379464816695
Oh , yes !	40851.30742983926
, but its volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous locations .	13748.703918533663
Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship , in spite of a great opposition of character .	10608.549258458432
said Charlotte , as soon as he was gone .	15559.850453513078
There is also one other person in the party , he continued after a pause , who more particularly wishes to be known to you , Will you allow me , or do I ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton ?	8252.188983120333
When a woman has five grown up daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty .	10608.549258458432
cried his wife impatiently .	30417.036999547854
Neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude , replied Elizabeth , have any possible claim on me , in the present instance .	9916.958575084616
and addressed herself particularly to Bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation .	8841.534051332943
His manners are very different from his cousin's .	16863.15364986961
But it is so strange !	24639.09342595445
About ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire , to which he belonged .	9260.379464816695
And pray what sort of guardians do you make ?	15559.850453513078
Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in my dressing-room .	13748.703918533663
Can you possibly guess , Lizzy , who is meant by this ?	13096.286853076666
You may depend upon my not mentioning it .	16863.15364986961
and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs .	9916.958575084616
and to prevent its ever happening again , took care to inform him at first , that it was a favourite haunt of hers .	9782.87932956929
certainly , cried his faithful assistant , no one can be really esteemed accomplished , who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with .	9660.348753098539
He was writing , and , without raising his head , coolly replied , Just as you please .	10834.408731294176
March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford .	18605.234516800505
Bennet was perfectly satisfied ;	30417.036999547854
When the gentlemen rose to go away , Bennet was mindful of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time .	9101.568221486219
that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking Darcy's character , though he had assured her that respect for the father , would always prevent his exposing the son .	9030.07563000038
His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost .	15559.850453513078
I have not the smallest hope .	21038.055088401863
She coloured as she spoke ;	24639.09342595445
She opened the door , and met Maria in the landing place , who , breathless with agitation , cried out , Oh , my dear Eliza !	9444.469146293983
There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed .	11714.159730430352
You shall hear what she says .	21038.055088401863
I do not see what right Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend's inclination , or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy .	8511.479941007732
A few weeks , he believed .	21038.055088401863
But think no more of the letter .	18605.234516800505
When is your next ball to be , Lizzy ?	15559.850453513078
You see how continually we are engaged there .	16863.15364986961
Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours ;	18605.234516800505
You know I always speak my mind , and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves .	10064.285584582429
See paragraph 1 .	40851.30742983926
I am happier even than Jane ;	21038.055088401863
but it must be done soon .	21038.055088401863
they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence ;	15559.850453513078
if it must be so , it must .	16863.15364986961
I should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match , cried Elizabeth .	10834.408731294176
She followed her father to the fire place , and they both sat down .	12101.48344089954
We have judged it best , that my niece should be married from this house , of which I hope you will approve .	9916.958575084616
and , after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable composure .	9916.958575084616
Yes , she will remain there till Christmas .	16863.15364986961
Special rules , set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license , apply to copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark .	8963.182761163067
and Gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing , by the servant's account , that their niece was taken suddenly ill ;	10064.285584582429
Remember , Eliza , that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do .	12101.48344089954
but I think I shall like your husband quite as well as Jane's .	12555.954772759242
I do not think we were speaking at all .	15559.850453513078
Well , cried her mother , it is all very right ;	13748.703918533663
and Hurst , principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings , joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss Bennet .	9782.87932956929
Yet he is such a man !	21038.055088401863
You have delighted us long enough .	21038.055088401863
Bennet could hardly contain herself .	24639.09342595445
Be that as it may , she saw him go with regret ;	13096.286853076666
She had even learnt to detect , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary .	9547.944950839816
dear me !	63582.78435607402
when it was no longer likely they should meet .	15559.850453513078
but with the rich , he is liberal-minded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and perhaps agreeable , allowing something for fortune and figure .	9444.469146293983
and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him .	14551.04788507868
You blamed me for coming ?	24639.09342595445
Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield ;	14551.04788507868
and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look .	9660.348753098539
Have you any idea , Lizzy , who this gentleman is ?	13748.703918533663
It was not in her nature , however , to increase her vexations , by dwelling on them .	10834.408731294176
and even Darcy acknowledged , that the partridges were remarkably well done ;	13096.286853076666
There is something very pompous in his style .	16863.15364986961
You certainly do , she replied with a smile ;	15559.850453513078
and though Collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as I have often told her , to come to Rosings every day , and play on the piano-forte in Jenkinson's room .	8900.461224119532
Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to conciliate her .	9782.87932956929
and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet .	11714.159730430352
They contained no actual complaint , nor was there any revival of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering .	10226.907161276042
Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage ;	15559.850453513078
Kitty was the only one who shed tears ;	16863.15364986961
And then you have added so much to it yourself , you are always buying books .	11380.291625061673
This cannot be !	40851.30742983926
and Elizabeth , who knew what curiosities his letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise .	10407.310844156898
When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer , I made a point of her having two men servants go with her .	9916.958575084616
Elizabeth , on her side , had much to do .	14551.04788507868
The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a headache ;	12555.954772759242
Indeed , Jane , you ought to believe me .	15559.850453513078
And so would Anne , if her health had allowed her to apply .	12555.954772759242
I will read it to you When my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to London , might be concluded in three or four days , but as we are certain it cannot be so , and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town , he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel .	7663.723081426315
They entered it in one of its lowest points , and drove for some time through a beautiful wood , stretching over a wide extent .	9660.348753098539
May we take my uncle's letter to read to her ?	14551.04788507868
When the card tables were placed , he had an opportunity of obliging her in return , by sitting down to whist .	10064.285584582429
After a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display .	8010.62536776369
but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands .	13748.703918533663
he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and that , if he marry prudently , his wife may teach him .	10064.285584582429
and Bennet , for many years after Lydia's birth , had been certain that he would .	11380.291625061673
and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements , new carriages and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield , in the course of three or four months .	8511.479941007732
hatred had vanished long ago , and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him , that could be so called .	9444.469146293983
But I will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well .	12555.954772759242
If his own vanity , however , did not mislead him , he was the cause , his pride and caprice were the cause of all that Jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer .	8786.068228923794
I fancy , Lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all .	11380.291625061673
Their affectionate mother shared all their grief ;	18605.234516800505
a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room .	8200.346801832206
Pray , how violent was Bingley's love ?	18605.234516800505
but Lady Catherine very resolutely , and not very politely , declined eating any thing ;	11714.159730430352
Now what have you to say ?	21038.055088401863
and in front , a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater , but without any artificial appearance .	10407.310844156898
He carved , and ate , and praised with delighted alacrity ;	13748.703918533663
E5 .	132911.3833977684
But though every thing seemed neat and comfortable , she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance ;	10226.907161276042
When I am in the country , he replied , I never wish to leave it ;	11380.291625061673
It only shews her being deficient in something herself sense or feeling .	13096.286853076666
Yes , very well .	30417.036999547854
and , though she was not very sanguine in expecting it , the application was a something to look forward to .	10226.907161276042
Is this a hint to me , Lizzy , said her father , to send for the horses ?	10834.408731294176
and more than commonly anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her .	10608.549258458432
However , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts , and I am very glad to hear what you tell us , of long sleeves .	9260.379464816695
you know he is , as well as I do ;	14551.04788507868
Pray forgive me , if I have been very presuming , or at least do not punish me so far , as to exclude me from P I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park .	8551.377728427238
Your idea of the ponies is delightful .	18605.234516800505
then recollecting himself , I will not detain you a minute , but let me , or let the servant , go after and Gardiner .	9660.348753098539
In the first place , he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron .	9660.348753098539
but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you .	16863.15364986961
Bennet could not have chosen better .	21038.055088401863
and know them to be so much attached to me !	14551.04788507868
Her sister made not the smallest objection , and the piano-forte was opened , and Darcy , after a few moments recollection , was not sorry for it .	9348.90374178589
Elizabeth was surprised , but said not a word .	15559.850453513078
CHAPTER X More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park , unexpectedly meet Darcy .	11089.641563468356
They have none of them much to recommend them , replied he ;	13096.286853076666
After walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on resuming their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant , there chanced to be a little alteration .	8308.54672257218
and Collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much .	13748.703918533663
and yet it should seem by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy .	9547.944950839816
I dare say you believed it ;	21038.055088401863
You are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on ;	11714.159730430352
nothing , therefore , could be fairly conjectured from that , though Elizabeth , who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings , was perfectly aware , that , had she known nothing of Darcy , she could have borne the dread of Lydia's infamy somewhat better .	8225.737991672406
her voice was weak , and her manner affected .	15559.850453513078
Would you believe it , Lizzy , that when he went to town last November , he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent , would have prevented his coming down again !	8684.37212344908
he kissed it with affectionate gallantry , though he hardly knew how to look , and they entered the house .	10407.310844156898
The particulars , I reserve till we meet .	16863.15364986961
and she looked on the whole scene , the river , the trees scattered on its banks , and the winding of the valley , as far as she could trace it , with delight .	8841.534051332943
It was an animating subject , and Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match .	10608.549258458432
Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ;	10226.907161276042
Neither could any thing be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities which Darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach .	8900.461224119532
She then sought her eldest sister , who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley .	10608.549258458432
From Collins !	63582.78435607402
Will you do me the honour of reading that letter ?	14551.04788507868
So , Lizzy , said he one day , your sister is crossed in love I find .	11089.641563468356
Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately ;	15559.850453513078
There was no want of discourse .	21038.055088401863
His coming into the country at all , is a most insolent thing indeed , and I wonder how he could presume to do it .	9660.348753098539
So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him !	13748.703918533663
and he was obliged to walk about the room , while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences .	9916.958575084616
How well it sounds .	30417.036999547854
It should not be said , that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers .	9547.944950839816
and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself ;	9444.469146293983
They found Bennet still up .	24639.09342595445
and they conversed with so much spirit and flow , as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself , as well as of Darcy .	9660.348753098539
But it is , returned she ;	21038.055088401863
He shook his head .	30417.036999547854
His daughter's request , for such it might be considered , of being admitted into her family again , before she set off for the North , received at first an absolute negative .	8963.182761163067
Stop me whilst you can .	24639.09342595445
Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure , and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming , when she found herself so affectionately received .	9547.944950839816
Is it possible !	40851.30742983926
Let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ;	10407.310844156898
He delighted in going to Pemberley , especially when he was least expected .	12555.954772759242
I had no notion but he would go a shooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company .	9916.958575084616
Elizabeth was in agonies .	30417.036999547854
Your uncle is as much surprised as I am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned , would have allowed him to act as he has done .	9101.568221486219
This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted : and Elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away .	9178.14939037836
Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to his wife ?	13096.286853076666
On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects .	13096.286853076666
An express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from Colonel Forster , to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers ;	8786.068228923794
This has been my motive , my fair cousin , and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem .	10064.285584582429
You ought certainly to forgive them as a christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing .	9260.379464816695
I will not encourage the impudence of either , by receiving them at Longbourn .	12101.48344089954
The next morning , however , made an alteration ;	15559.850453513078
Charlotte is an excellent manager , I dare say .	15559.850453513078
It is evident by this , added Jane , that he comes back no more this winter .	11089.641563468356
To be sure that did seem as if he admired her indeed I rather believe he did I heard something about it but I hardly know what something about Robinson .	9178.14939037836
With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ;	11380.291625061673
When she remembered the style of his address , she was still full of indignation ;	11714.159730430352
When first Bennet had married , economy was held to be perfectly useless ;	12555.954772759242
The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came , and Bennet was forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle , was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth .	8338.606959546763
can it be really so !	24639.09342595445
She had never seen a place for which nature had done more , or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste .	9547.944950839816
I hope , added Gardiner , that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her .	10834.408731294176
what can have induced him to behave so cruelly ?	15559.850453513078
Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications .	10226.907161276042
His eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity ;	11714.159730430352
As soon as all had ate , and the elder ones paid , the carriage was ordered ;	11089.641563468356
You know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself .	11089.641563468356
Let me hear what it is .	21038.055088401863
He meant , I believe , replied Jane , to go to Epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the postilions , and try if any thing could be made out from them .	8733.768489132548
observed Bennet .	63582.78435607402
and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible .	11089.641563468356
The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic .	13096.286853076666
My overhearings were more to the purpose than yours , Eliza , said Charlotte .	12101.48344089954
his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had .	9101.568221486219
said Elizabeth .	63582.78435607402
The first mentioned was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , I had detached Bingley from your sister , and the other , that I had , in defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , ruined the immediate prosperity , and blasted the prospects of Wickham .	8152.499297932932
Darcy is all politeness , said Elizabeth , smiling .	15559.850453513078
said Jane .	63582.78435607402
It was some days , however , before they received any invitation thither , for while there were visitors in the house , they could not be necessary ;	9348.90374178589
Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth and it was soon done done while Bennet was stirring the fire .	10226.907161276042
I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings , and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three , of whom we shall deprive you .	8473.529323869427
It taught me to hope , said he , as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before .	10608.549258458432
but since then , we have both , I hope , improved in civility .	12101.48344089954
but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him .	9178.14939037836
When Jane and Elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in her praise of Bingley before , expressed to her sister how very much she admired him .	9101.568221486219
There can be no love in all this .	16863.15364986961
Yet it is hard , she sometimes thought , that this poor man cannot come to a house , which he has legally hired , without raising all this speculation !	9178.14939037836
and Bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice .	13096.286853076666
Good heavens !	63582.78435607402
If I had been able , said she , to carry my point of going to Brighton , with all my family , this would not have happened ;	9348.90374178589
Indeed I had .	40851.30742983926
and in the mean time , she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married , to Hill and the two housemaids .	9547.944950839816
Lydia's being settled in the North , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment ;	8593.376018081019
The younger ones out before the elder are married !	15559.850453513078
My excellent father died about five years ago ;	16863.15364986961
We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening , said Elizabeth .	11089.641563468356
And if you will stay another month complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London , for I am going there early in June , for a week ;	8733.768489132548
Lizzy , you must not do so .	18605.234516800505
Only look at her .	30417.036999547854
and the Hursts have no horses to theirs .	16863.15364986961
She directly replied , You need not be frightened .	15559.850453513078
How nicely we are crammed in !	21038.055088401863
The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning's impatience .	12555.954772759242

Lizzy , when you first read that letter , I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now .	10064.285584582429
but her's she thought was still worse .	18605.234516800505
and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty .	14551.04788507868
But does Lydia know nothing of this ?	18605.234516800505
She counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent ;	12555.954772759242
Can such abominable pride as his , have ever done him good ?	13096.286853076666
Oh !	132911.3833977684
Good Heaven !	63582.78435607402
Have all her friends left her ?	21038.055088401863
Their brother , indeed , was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency .	10608.549258458432
The colour which had been driven from her face , returned for half a minute with an additional glow , and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes , as she thought for that space of time , that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken .	8279.76739767998
Pardon me .	63582.78435607402
My dear , dear Lizzy , I would I do congratulate you but are you certain ?	11380.291625061673
Her father had been an attorney in Meryton , and had left her four thousand pounds .	11380.291625061673
She had fully proposed being engaged by Wickham for those very dances : and to have Collins instead !	10834.408731294176
I am so grieved for him .	21038.055088401863
She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together .	10608.549258458432
no , I certainly am not .	21038.055088401863
You quite mistook Darcy .	30417.036999547854
but this is the true one .	21038.055088401863
Yes , in conjunction with his friend .	18605.234516800505
and still different from either , was what Bennet sent to Collins , in reply to his last .	10834.408731294176
Bingley was every thing that was charming , except the professed lover of her daughter .	11714.159730430352
They repulsed every attempt of Bennet at conversation , and by so doing , threw a languor over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Collins , who was complimenting Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests .	8010.62536776369
As all conversation was thereby at an end , Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room .	11714.159730430352
Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject ;	14551.04788507868
When first he came in , he had spoken to her but little ;	12555.954772759242
If it is designedly done , they cannot be justified ;	14551.04788507868
But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both .	7884.856057523502
and , as they drew near the appointed inn where Bennet's carriage was to meet them , they quickly perceived , in token of the coachman's punctuality , both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs .	8637.644626240744
What , none of you ?	24639.09342595445
Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman , and required information ;	11380.291625061673
Well , my comfort is , I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done .	9348.90374178589
Too much , I am afraid ;	21038.055088401863
This was very amiable , but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any conception of ;	11380.291625061673
His family knew him to be on all common occasions , a most negligent and dilatory correspondent , but at such a time , they had hoped for exertion .	9260.379464816695
His first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance , as far as it would go .	8308.54672257218
She wanted to talk , but there seemed an embargo on every subject .	12555.954772759242
In every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived .	12101.48344089954
but on perceiving Darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner .	10226.907161276042
She was more alive to the disgrace , which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham , a fortnight before they took place .	8551.377728427238
and Gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in London the very next day , and would assist Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia .	8593.376018081019
And then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you ;	10834.408731294176
As for Elizabeth , her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last ;	11714.159730430352
They are not married , nor can I find there was any intention of being so ;	11380.291625061673
for you are really proud of your defects in writing , because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution , which if not estimable , you think at least highly interesting .	8684.37212344908
You never will be able to make both of them good for any thing .	12101.48344089954
They walked towards the Lucases , because Kitty wished to call upon Maria ;	12555.954772759242
But you see that Jane , said her aunt , does not think so ill of Wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt .	9547.944950839816
I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ;	12555.954772759242
it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it .	11714.159730430352
The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend , assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London , might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment .	8551.377728427238
She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either , or make either appear to advantage .	10608.549258458432
You allude perhaps to the entail of this estate .	15559.850453513078
She could not win him , however , to any conversation ;	13748.703918533663
by her ease and liveliness , his mind might have been softened , his manners improved , and from his judgment , information , and knowledge of the world , she must have received benefit of greater importance .	8684.37212344908
Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone .	13096.286853076666
I enquired after their brother , of course .	16863.15364986961
Bennet could hardly comprehend it .	24639.09342595445
and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both .	10834.408731294176
Dear me !	63582.78435607402
by reason , by reflection , by every thing .	15559.850453513078
to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed , and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation , console herself for the present , and prepare for another disappointment .	8841.534051332943
During dinner , Bennet scarcely spoke at all ;	16863.15364986961
To convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself , was no very difficult point .	11089.641563468356
my daughters are brought up differently .	21038.055088401863
and after listening a moment , she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry , and calling loudly after her .	10064.285584582429
Why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent , said she , did he come at all ?	9916.958575084616
I do think it is the hardest thing in the world , that your estate should be entailed away from your own children ;	9916.958575084616
Bennet treasured up the hint , and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married ;	11380.291625061673
Do you know Bingley ?	30417.036999547854
Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy .	14551.04788507868
and very unwillingly said so .	24639.09342595445
Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter ;	9178.14939037836
Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not .	11089.641563468356
He had been some time with Gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river , and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning .	8370.035361590719
He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies , of whose beauty he had heard much ;	10064.285584582429
Good God !	63582.78435607402
Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever .	9660.348753098539
Something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them , but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life .	9260.379464816695
it came from Netherfield , and was opened immediately .	15559.850453513078
They have each their advantages , and I can be equally happy in either .	12101.48344089954
She was wild to be at home to hear , to see , to be upon the spot , to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her , in a family so deranged ;	8637.644626240744
In making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self-reproach .	8841.534051332943
CHAPTER I Elizabeth , as they drove along , watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation ;	10407.310844156898
Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance ;	13748.703918533663
And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton , of whom I shall subjoin a list , according to his information .	9260.379464816695
But make a virtue of it by all means .	15559.850453513078
Arguments are too much like disputes .	21038.055088401863
I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , Lizzy ?	13096.286853076666
The rest of the evening passed with the appearance , on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no farther attempt to distinguish Elizabeth ;	9547.944950839816
I believe , Ma'am , I may safely promise you never to dance with him .	11714.159730430352
No , no .	40851.30742983926
and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least .	13096.286853076666
At length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself .	9348.90374178589
She followed him with her eyes , envied every one to whom he spoke , had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee ;	9782.87932956929
I never saw such a long chin in my life .	14551.04788507868
I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield .	12101.48344089954
cried Elizabeth ;	63582.78435607402
but this was all lost upon me .	18605.234516800505
No , Kitty , I have at last learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it .	10226.907161276042
The principal purport of his letter was to inform them , that Wickham had resolved on quitting the Militia .	10608.549258458432
I shall be very fit to see Jane which is all I want .	12555.954772759242
When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford , every eye was in search of the Parsonage , and every turning expected to bring it in view .	9178.14939037836
her complexion has no brilliancy ;	24639.09342595445
said her mother as soon as she was in the hall .	13748.703918533663
They will join me early to-morrow , he continued , and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you , Bingley and his sisters .	9444.469146293983
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity .	13748.703918533663
I do not mind his not talking to Long , said Miss Lucas , but I wish he had danced with Eliza .	10064.285584582429
but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder .	13748.703918533663
Yes , there can ;	30417.036999547854
If you received the work electronically , the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund .	8963.182761163067
Make haste , make haste .	24639.09342595445
My reasons for believing it are briefly these : It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance , or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable .	8733.768489132548
After amusing himself some time with their curiosity , he thus explained .	13096.286853076666
I had not believed it possible .	21038.055088401863
Forgive me ;	63582.78435607402
This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself .	13748.703918533663
Darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say something indistinctly of his concern , and observe her in compassionate silence .	10226.907161276042
At length there was nothing more to be said ;	15559.850453513078
Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ;	12101.48344089954
She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room .	12555.954772759242
But at least it shews , that she was serious in the object of her journey .	11380.291625061673
but , exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone .	10226.907161276042
Elizabeth quietly answered Undoubtedly ;	30417.036999547854
Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic ;	18605.234516800505
You must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course .	9782.87932956929
I can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ;	11714.159730430352
Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming .	16863.15364986961
I dare say she will ;	24639.09342595445
But self , though it would intrude , could not engross her .	13096.286853076666
His temptation is not adequate to the risk .	16863.15364986961
a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point , without being resented .	11714.159730430352
Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal from the shire , as clearly as Gardiner could do .	10226.907161276042
To Bennet's acknowledgments he briefly replied , with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family ;	10226.907161276042
When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned , in terms of such mortifying , yet merited reproach , her sense of shame was severe .	9030.07563000038
He is now gone into the army , she added , but I am afraid he has turned out very wild .	10226.907161276042
and , after giving each of them an hasty kiss , hurried into the vestibule , where Jane , who came running down stairs from her mother's apartment , immediately met her .	9030.07563000038
Take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one .	13096.286853076666
I am most seriously displeased .	24639.09342595445
When they ascended the steps to the hall , Maria's alarm was every moment increasing , and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm .	9660.348753098539
My feelings will not be repressed .	21038.055088401863
Nor was Darcy's vindication , though grateful to her feelings , capable of consoling her for such discovery .	10834.408731294176
All that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds , secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ;	8684.37212344908
My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other .	14551.04788507868
She has known him only a fortnight .	18605.234516800505
I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being .	9101.568221486219
and Elizabeth , as they waited for the housekeeper , had leisure to wonder at her being where she was .	10407.310844156898
Elizabeth , though expecting no less , thanked him with tears of gratitude ;	12555.954772759242
I am sick of them all .	21038.055088401863
You shall not , for the sake of one individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that selfishness is prudence , and insensibility of danger , security for happiness .	8593.376018081019
Elizabeth now began to revive .	24639.09342595445
She received him with her very best politeness , which he returned with as much more , apologising for his intrusion , without any previous acquaintance with her , which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice .	8175.953084916759
Very nonsensical to come at all !	21038.055088401863
Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to identify , do copyright research on , transcribe and proofread public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm collection .	9348.90374178589
From that moment I observed my friend's behaviour attentively ;	15559.850453513078
One enjoyment was certain that of suitableness as companions ;	15559.850453513078
And if I am that choice , why may not I accept him ?	12555.954772759242
D The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you can do with this work .	10407.310844156898
Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival , that Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine ;	7724.662885665901
Elizabeth smiled .	63582.78435607402
Such doings discomposed Bennet exceedingly .	24639.09342595445
My sister , who is more than ten years my junior , was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew , Colonel Fitzwilliam , and myself .	9444.469146293983
It suddenly struck her that it might be from lady Catherine ;	13748.703918533663
E8 .	132911.3833977684
Let Wickham be your man .	24639.09342595445
She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it .	9547.944950839816
At last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance of Darcy , with such a smile over the face , as she remembered to have sometimes seen , when he looked at her .	8841.534051332943
and whenever they changed their quarters , either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to , for some little assistance towards discharging their bills .	9547.944950839816
But I must write no more .	21038.055088401863
and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation .	11714.159730430352
Write to me very often , my dear .	16863.15364986961
She could see him instantly before her , in every charm of air and address ;	11714.159730430352
But , really , I know not what to say .	14551.04788507868
and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it , to Ramsgate ;	11714.159730430352
His plan did not vary on seeing them .	16863.15364986961
Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ?	14551.04788507868
just enough to make one good sort of man ;	15559.850453513078
and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been ;	12555.954772759242
Poor Jane !	63582.78435607402
The more I see of the world , the more am I dissatisfied with it ;	11714.159730430352
He and his sisters were well , I hope , when you left London .	12101.48344089954
International donations are gratefully accepted , but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States .	9916.958575084616
CHAPTER III .	63582.78435607402
Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect , that the sight of such rooms , so many servants , and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them .	8963.182761163067
Don't keep coughing so , Kitty , for heaven's sake !	14551.04788507868
Under such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief .	10608.549258458432
and at that moment she felt , that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something !	11380.291625061673
Lord , how ashamed I should be of not being married before three and twenty !	11714.159730430352
She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure .	13748.703918533663
nor could she for many hours , learn to think of it less than incessantly .	11714.159730430352
You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness ;	11380.291625061673
His consenting to marry her is a proof , I will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking .	9916.958575084616
To-morrow fortnight .	63582.78435607402
but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other , of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that Denny had brought him from London , and that he was to have a lieutenant's commission in the shire .	8108.202620023328
It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way .	11380.291625061673
My youngest of all , is lately married , and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds , walking with a young man , who I believe will soon become a part of the family .	8841.534051332943
They were then , with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance , taken into the house ;	10064.285584582429
But Elizabeth , who had not the least inclination to remain with them , laughingly answered , No , no ;	10407.310844156898
and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement .	14551.04788507868
All field sports were over .	24639.09342595445
My style of writing is very different from yours .	15559.850453513078
c .	132911.3833977684
and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror , Gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power .	10834.408731294176
Thus , we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition .	11714.159730430352
She wrote even to Jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her former professions of regard .	10064.285584582429
CHAPTER X The day passed much as the day before had done .	13096.286853076666
He merely added , that he should not write again , till he had something of importance to mention .	10608.549258458432
It originated in Gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support , and consequently preferred her husband's .	9348.90374178589
After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with It is your turn to say something now , Darcy .	9916.958575084616
and his commendation of every thing would have touched Bennet's heart , but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property .	9444.469146293983
She comes to us to-day .	24639.09342595445
I will not tell you what it is .	16863.15364986961
At length however Bennet had no more to say ;	15559.850453513078
The power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor , and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance .	9444.469146293983
Then turning to Bennet , he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon .	12555.954772759242
The subjection in which his father had brought him up , had given him originally great humility of manner , but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head , living in retirement , and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity .	8279.76739767998
From the entrance hall , of which Collins pointed out , with a rapturous air , the fine proportion and finished ornaments , they followed the servants through an anti-chamber , to the room where Lady Catherine , her daughter , and Jenkinson were sitting .	8402.927271718636
and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over .	11714.159730430352
Now , said she , that this first meeting is over , I feel perfectly easy .	11380.291625061673
The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited .	13748.703918533663
After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight , and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear ;	9547.944950839816
What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy ?	16863.15364986961
Lydia was exceedingly fond of him .	21038.055088401863
When coffee was over , Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him ;	11380.291625061673
I do not believe she often sees such at home .	14551.04788507868
A clergyman like you must marry .	21038.055088401863
But gracious me !	40851.30742983926
It was agreed to .	30417.036999547854
But she would not be secure .	21038.055088401863
Though I shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ;	13096.286853076666
You are so strange !	30417.036999547854
Having resolved to do it without loss of time , as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday , and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment , he set about it in a very orderly manner , with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business .	7993.065613794534
E GARDINER .	63582.78435607402
For my own part , she rejoined , I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her .	10407.310844156898
and in the evening Bennet's invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter .	10407.310844156898
Yes , always , she replied , without knowing what she said , for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , I remember hearing you once say , Darcy , that you hardly ever forgave , that your resentment once created was unappeasable .	8152.499297932932
my sweetest Lizzy !	40851.30742983926
And I think you will agree with me , in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece's .	9444.469146293983
Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations ;	14551.04788507868
CHAPTER XVIII .	63582.78435607402
F6 .	132911.3833977684
that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her , and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening .	9178.14939037836
CHAPTER III .	63582.78435607402
What a charming amusement for young people this is , Darcy !	13748.703918533663
I remember , as soon as ever I saw him , when he first came into Hertfordshire last year , I thought how likely it was that you should come together .	9101.568221486219
But it is all , all too late now .	15559.850453513078
and Bennet found , with amazement and horror , that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter .	9916.958575084616
She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse , but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other , and how formal and cold was their manner , whenever they did .	8786.068228923794
No one who has ever seen you together , can doubt his affection .	12555.954772759242
Elizabeth listened as little as she could , but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name .	10608.549258458432
that it should be equally unreserved was impossible .	16863.15364986961
It is because he will not give himself the trouble .	14551.04788507868
Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself , and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam , Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word I say .	8733.768489132548
He is perfectly well behaved , polite , and unassuming , said her uncle .	12101.48344089954
You have reduced him to his present state of poverty , comparative poverty .	12555.954772759242
Nearly three weeks .	40851.30742983926
Oh !	132911.3833977684
His appearance was greatly in his favour ;	18605.234516800505
I have sent for you on an affair of importance .	14551.04788507868
When to these recollections was added the developement of Wickham's character , it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before , were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful .	8402.927271718636
but Ashworth is too far off !	21038.055088401863
She now lost every expectation of pleasure .	18605.234516800505
Miss Bennet , replied her ladyship , in an angry tone , you ought to know , that I am not to be trifled with .	9660.348753098539
for I consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman .	10608.549258458432
On reaching the spacious lobby above , they were shewn into a very pretty sitting-room , lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below ;	9348.90374178589
You know pretty well , I suppose , what has been done for the young people .	11380.291625061673
At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted .	13748.703918533663
I never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong .	11714.159730430352
Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible .	14551.04788507868
Elizabeth silently attended her .	30417.036999547854
Oh , Jane , take care .	21038.055088401863
Oh !	132911.3833977684
' But afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time .	10226.907161276042
She examined into their employments , looked at their work , and advised them to do it differently ;	10834.408731294176
CHAPTER XI .	63582.78435607402
unless you looked up to him as a superior .	15559.850453513078
I have therefore made up my mind to tell you , that I do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare .	9260.379464816695
and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William , in which she was readily joined by Jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of Collins , and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London .	7928.326207998349
Who do you mean , my dear ?	18605.234516800505
Though Bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage .	9178.14939037836
how can it affect them ?	24639.09342595445
They had nothing to accuse him of but pride ;	15559.850453513078
He was coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland : when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey .	8637.644626240744
Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game , except when Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh's being too hot or too cold , or having too much or too little light .	8684.37212344908
but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future .	11380.291625061673

He scarcely ever spoke to her , and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself , were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas , whose civility in listening to him , was a seasonable relief to them all , and especially to her friend .	8200.346801832206
CHAPTER VIII .	63582.78435607402
When at length they arose to take leave , Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn ;	9660.348753098539
I could see him with perfect indifference , but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of .	10407.310844156898
I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes .	18605.234516800505
and the two , who were most anxiously expected , to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen , were in very good time .	9782.87932956929
No one but Bennet , regretted that their stay would be so short ;	12555.954772759242
Lydia has no brothers to step forward ;	18605.234516800505
CHAPTER XII .	63582.78435607402
Well , mamma , said she , when they were all returned to the breakfast room , and what do you think of my husband ?	9660.348753098539
'Tis as good as a Lord !	21038.055088401863
forgive the question are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ?	12101.48344089954
and therefore gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent , his actions were capable of a very different construction ;	8733.768489132548
But what is that to me ?	21038.055088401863
a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade .	10226.907161276042
To fortune I am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since I am well aware that it could not be complied with ;	9101.568221486219
Girls , can I do any thing for you in Meryton ?	13748.703918533663
[ Illustration : Morning Dress .	24639.09342595445
But the wife of Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation , that she could , upon the whole , have no cause to repine .	9101.568221486219
Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table , and they went up stairs together .	11714.159730430352
Your alliance will be a disgrace ;	21038.055088401863
I have every reason in the world to think ill of you .	13096.286853076666
Elizabeth immediately recognising the livery , guessed what it meant , and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations , by acquainting them with the honour which she expected .	9101.568221486219
At present , indeed , they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood ;	9660.348753098539
The world has been deceived in that respect ;	16863.15364986961
Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility ;	15559.850453513078
He must write his own sermons ;	21038.055088401863
which will not be yours till after your mother's decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to .	10407.310844156898
She stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation , and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery .	10226.907161276042
Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ?	10407.310844156898
Miss Darcy's praise occupied the chief of it .	16863.15364986961
Recovering himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said , Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of .	9348.90374178589
Is her husband , is the son of his late father's steward , to be his brother ?	11089.641563468356
Lady Catherine approached , and , after listening for a few minutes , said to Darcy , Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss , if she practised more , and could have the advantage of a London master .	8593.376018081019
but Sir William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane , who were dancing together .	9030.07563000038
How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell , but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you .	9660.348753098539
Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother .	18605.234516800505
Certainly , replied Elizabeth there are such people , but I hope I am not one of them .	10834.408731294176
See paragraph 1 .	40851.30742983926
I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did .	11380.291625061673
Had his own happiness , however , been the only sacrifice , he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best ;	9348.90374178589
And with a bow to Darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room .	9547.944950839816
She would not betray her trust , I suppose , without bribery and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be found .	9444.469146293983
but they were now necessary , and she assured him with some confusion , of her attachment to Darcy .	10608.549258458432
All was acknowledged , and half the night spent in conversation .	13748.703918533663
If we are ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been , said Elizabeth , and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what Gardiner has done for them , because Wickham has not sixpence of his own .	8338.606959546763
Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father .	14551.04788507868
Hunsford , near Westerham , Kent , 15th October .	15559.850453513078
Bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from London , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time .	8637.644626240744
and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life .	9782.87932956929
I would keep a pack of foxhounds , and drink a bottle of wine every day .	11380.291625061673
Now , seriously , what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence ?	12555.954772759242
and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to elope with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ;	8733.768489132548
Must it be so ?	30417.036999547854
These bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had I with greater policy concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified , unalloyed inclination ;	9030.07563000038
I hope she will turn out well .	18605.234516800505
Teaze him laugh at him .	24639.09342595445
She danced four dances with him at Meryton ;	16863.15364986961
While the contents of the first letter remained on her mind , she was all surprise all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl , whom it was impossible he could marry for money ;	8900.461224119532
Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start , and before he could recover himself enough to speak , she , in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's situation , hastily exclaimed , I beg your pardon , but I must leave you .	8370.035361590719
I know not , Miss Elizabeth , said he , whether Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us , but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it .	8511.479941007732
And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection .	10226.907161276042
Any place would do , of about three or four hundred a year ;	12555.954772759242
The note was immediately dispatched , and its contents as quickly complied with .	12555.954772759242
and when it closed , Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon Charlotte's degree of contentment , to understand her address in guiding , and composure in bearing with her husband , and to acknowledge that it was all done very well .	8370.035361590719
But no letter appeared , and she was completely puzzled .	14551.04788507868
This was a lucky idea of mine , indeed !	15559.850453513078
but it is not sound .	24639.09342595445
What is his name ?	30417.036999547854
Reynolds , either from pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister .	10407.310844156898
Her look and manners were open , cheerful and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and I remained convinced from the evening's scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment .	8279.76739767998
Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer , and forced his younger sister to be civil also , and say what the occasion required .	9782.87932956929
Every thing that is charming !	24639.09342595445
and after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do , which was the more probable from the time of year .	8841.534051332943
Brother-in-law of Wickham !	40851.30742983926
Happy shall I be , when his stay at Netherfield is over !	13096.286853076666
Miss Darcy was tall , and on a larger scale than Elizabeth ;	13096.286853076666
At present we have nothing to guide us .	16863.15364986961
The account of his connection with the Pemberley family , was exactly what he had related himself ;	11089.641563468356
Your sisters are engaged , and there is not another woman in the room , whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with .	9348.90374178589
When I wrote that letter , replied Darcy , I believed myself perfectly calm and cool , but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit .	9030.07563000038
The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth , as the first .	11089.641563468356
We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Wickham with money .	12555.954772759242
As soon as they had driven from the door , Elizabeth was called on by her cousin , to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings , which , for Charlotte's sake , she made more favourable than it really was .	8402.927271718636
They may wish many things besides his happiness ;	16863.15364986961
I must conclude , for I cannot be long from my poor mother .	12555.954772759242
cried Elizabeth , brightening up for a moment .	16863.15364986961
But however he did not .	24639.09342595445
Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Hurst or Miss Bingley ;	13096.286853076666
Your friend performs delightfully ;	30417.036999547854
and the valley , here contracted into a glen , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it .	9348.90374178589
They could talk of nothing but officers ;	18605.234516800505
Their conduct has been such , replied Elizabeth , as neither you , nor I , nor any body , can ever forget .	9916.958575084616
She had obtained private intelligence that Darcy did not wish for cards ;	13096.286853076666
why is not every body as happy ?	18605.234516800505
nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable .	14551.04788507868
He had never before supposed that , could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter , it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself , as by the present arrangement .	8963.182761163067
Kitty stared at him , and Lydia exclaimed .	16863.15364986961
Elizabeth could not help saying , It is very much to his credit , I am sure , that you should think so .	9916.958575084616
On their being joined by Bingley himself , Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas ;	12555.954772759242
Wickham passed all his youth there , you know .	15559.850453513078
As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , I shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females .	8593.376018081019
Very little was said by either ;	21038.055088401863
repeated Elizabeth , in utter amazement .	21038.055088401863
her liveliness had been never worse timed .	18605.234516800505
Perhaps it will be as well , if you discourage his coming here so very often .	11380.291625061673
CHAPTER V Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate .	10834.408731294176
She retreated from the window , fearful of being seen ;	14551.04788507868
he sustained it however with fortitude , and so far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into conversation with Gardiner .	9660.348753098539
She shared in their attendance on Bennet , and was a great comfort to them , in their hours of freedom .	10226.907161276042
Does he know his real character ?	21038.055088401863
In her kind schemes for Elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam .	12101.48344089954
We shall often meet , I hope , in Hertfordshire .	14551.04788507868
replied Kitty , it looks just like that man that used to be with him before .	11380.291625061673
If you were to give me forty such men , I never could be so happy as you .	10834.408731294176
She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious , made no other reply to Elizabeth's salutation , than a slight inclination of the head , and sat down without saying a word .	8841.534051332943
He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever , on the occasion .	11089.641563468356
What is to become of us !	21038.055088401863
It was kindly meant .	30417.036999547854
Lydia declared herself satisfied .	30417.036999547854
My sister , I am sure , will not hear of her removal .	12555.954772759242
The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities , though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings ;	9348.90374178589
If it was not for the entail I should not mind it .	13096.286853076666
And then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it .	10834.408731294176
They have some of the finest woods in the country .	14551.04788507868
Oh !	132911.3833977684
What did you say of me , that I did not deserve ?	13096.286853076666
You forget that I have made no answer .	16863.15364986961
Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility .	12101.48344089954
Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied , Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully .	10407.310844156898
I know not what to think .	21038.055088401863
Bennet could not give her consent , or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , though she talked to Bingley of nothing else , for half an hour ;	8963.182761163067
She knew not what to think , nor how to account for it .	12555.954772759242
So much the better .	30417.036999547854
You wanted me , I know , to say 'Yes , ' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste ;	10064.285584582429
It is admirable !	40851.30742983926
They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which I cannot wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects .	9260.379464816695
pride he probably had , and if not , it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town , where the family did not visit .	9348.90374178589
But , Lizzy , you can tell us whether it is like or not .	12101.48344089954
and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's dying an old maid .	12101.48344089954
The wisest and the best of men , nay , the wisest and best of their actions , may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke .	8963.182761163067
Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper ;	13748.703918533663
and it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning , and never said a word about it till now .	9444.469146293983
After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room , from the sideboard to the fender , to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London , Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden , which was large and well laid out , and to the cultivation of which he attended himself .	7943.73854661938
I should infinitely prefer a book .	21038.055088401863
but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless Darcy returned within the stated time .	9916.958575084616
This is not to be borne .	21038.055088401863
Had his first appearance , or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining , been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Darcy , the gardener's expression of surprise , on beholding his master , must immediately have told it .	8370.035361590719
Hurst had therefore nothing to do , but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep .	10407.310844156898
I thought it would never be over ;	18605.234516800505
But if I do not take your likeness now , I may never have another opportunity .	11380.291625061673
Elizabeth made no answer , and walked on , her heart swelling with indignation .	12101.48344089954
And do you like her ?	24639.09342595445
It was an evening of no common delight to them all ;	13748.703918533663
I never can be thankful , Bennet , for any thing about the entail .	12101.48344089954
Were the same fair prospect to arise at present , as had flattered them a year ago , every thing , she was persuaded , would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion .	8963.182761163067
He danced only four dances !	24639.09342595445
I have not a doubt of Bingley's sincerity , said Elizabeth warmly ;	13096.286853076666
Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother , on his approaching marriage , were all that was affectionate and insincere .	10608.549258458432
Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort .	13748.703918533663
He likes to have his own way very well , replied Colonel Fitzwilliam .	12555.954772759242
It was painful , exceedingly painful , to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return .	9916.958575084616
Yes , thought Elizabeth , that would be a delightful scheme , indeed , and completely do for us at once .	10226.907161276042
but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off .	13096.286853076666
said he hastily , as he opened the door .	15559.850453513078
She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own , but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action , she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage .	8593.376018081019
As often as I can .	24639.09342595445
If you love Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham , you must be very happy .	10608.549258458432
She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas .	16863.15364986961
Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming , without changing colour .	11714.159730430352
1 .	132911.3833977684
You may depend on it , replied the other , for Nicholls was in Meryton last night ;	11089.641563468356
and she could hardly suppress a smile , at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had revolted , in his offer to herself .	8900.461224119532
I told Collins so before you came .	18605.234516800505
I knew , said he , that what I wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary .	10608.549258458432
Why did not you seek legal redress ?	18605.234516800505
When they repaired to the dining-room , Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place , which , in all their former parties , had belonged to him , by her sister .	8841.534051332943
It was necessary to laugh , when she would rather have cried .	13096.286853076666
Soon after you left me on Saturday , I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were .	10064.285584582429
but I always speak what I think .	18605.234516800505
And rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had not Collins thus addressed her , When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ;	8252.188983120333
But that is nothing to us .	21038.055088401863
Our distress , my dear Lizzy , is very great .	14551.04788507868
Not that I mean to find fault with you , for such things I know are all chance in this world .	10226.907161276042
I never saw such capacity , and taste , and application , and elegance , as you describe , united .	10407.310844156898
the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice .	12555.954772759242
found fault with the arrangement of the furniture , or detected the housemaid in negligence ;	11714.159730430352
How can you contrive to write so even ?	16863.15364986961
that my dear mother had more command over herself ;	15559.850453513078
The two first dances , however , brought a return of distress ;	13096.286853076666
The room in which the ladies sat was backwards .	15559.850453513078
My father's opinion of me does me the greatest honour ;	14551.04788507868
It may be easily believed , that however little of novelty could be added to their fears , hopes , and conjectures , on this interesting subject , by its repeated discussion , no other could detain them from it long , during the whole of the journey .	8308.54672257218
but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption !	12101.48344089954
The coach , therefore , took them the first stage of their journey , and brought its master back to Longbourn .	10226.907161276042
cried Jane , what do you mean , Sir ?	15559.850453513078
for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Darcy's steward , and of that , I can assure you , he informed me himself .	9030.07563000038
Her figure was elegant , and she walked well ;	15559.850453513078
I have faults enough , but they are not , I hope , of understanding .	11714.159730430352
but she could not approve him ;	21038.055088401863
and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so full of contradictions and varieties , sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance , and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination .	8437.387080704751
Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections ?	13096.286853076666
CHAPTER I It is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune , must be in want of a wife .	9444.469146293983
I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then Georgiana , unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me .	8473.529323869427
It is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married , continued her mother , but at the same time , Bingley , it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me .	8511.479941007732
And in the first place , let us hear what has happened to you all , since you went away .	10407.310844156898
Besides , it will not much signify what one wears this summer , after the shire have left Meryton , and they are going in a fortnight .	9444.469146293983
His debts are to be paid , amounting , I believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her , and his commission purchased .	8841.534051332943
He dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday .	10834.408731294176
Her mother's ungraciousness , made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind ;	11089.641563468356
But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes .	8511.479941007732
You are rather disposed to call his interference officious ?	15559.850453513078
and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go , she did not seem to ask for compassion .	10608.549258458432
Whilst wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and Elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of Darcy approaching them , and at no great distance .	8593.376018081019
At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here .	10834.408731294176
and it was but the other day , that I recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her .	9101.568221486219
We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side , said Jane : I hope and trust they will yet be happy .	9660.348753098539
that she had a new gown , or a new parasol , which she would have described more fully , but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry , as Forster called her , and they were going to the camp ;	8473.529323869427
If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement , I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one .	8786.068228923794
And pray may I ask ?	24639.09342595445
I should never be happy without him , so think it no harm to be off .	11380.291625061673
have you heard from my uncle ?	21038.055088401863
He repeated the question , with some surprise at her silence .	13748.703918533663
and a report soon followed that Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly .	10407.310844156898
for she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening , although utterly unknown to her before .	9030.07563000038
and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry her , had she been his relation .	8786.068228923794
As for your Elizabeth's picture , you must not attempt to have it taken , for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes ?	9660.348753098539
It would have suited me in every respect .	16863.15364986961
He immediately offered to fetch her others ;	18605.234516800505
I ought not to have said a word about it .	14551.04788507868
His father was an excellent man , said Gardiner .	15559.850453513078
One ought not to repine ;	24639.09342595445
I cannot catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as I often see done .	10407.310844156898
She was not sorry , however , to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung .	9782.87932956929
the other is Charlotte's marriage .	24639.09342595445
But you How are you ?	24639.09342595445
He danced only four dances , though gentlemen were scarce ;	14551.04788507868
Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ;	9916.958575084616
Good gracious !	63582.78435607402
I am more likely to want time than courage , Elizabeth .	13748.703918533663
And though he exclaimed at the term , she found that it had been pretty much the case .	10834.408731294176
and continually was she repeating , Why is he so altered ?	13748.703918533663
You may well warn me against such an evil .	15559.850453513078
They were of course all intending to be surprised ;	15559.850453513078
my head is always full of something else .	16863.15364986961
She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an inmate of Darcy's house , and mentioned with raptures , some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture .	9101.568221486219
This however was no evil to Elizabeth , and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough ;	10834.408731294176
He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before , on his reading Collins's letter ;	11714.159730430352
Jane , cried Elizabeth , was there a servant belonging to it , who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ?	9547.944950839816
They travelled as expeditiously as possible ;	21038.055088401863
You are a very strange creature by way of a friend !	13748.703918533663
When Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed , which certainly was not unseldom , she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte .	9444.469146293983
The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity ;	8252.188983120333
Your tempers are by no means unlike .	18605.234516800505
and , after receiving her answer , asked in an hesitating manner how long Darcy had been staying there .	10608.549258458432
His being so sure of succeeding , was wrong , said she ;	13096.286853076666
Allow me to say , Lady Catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application , have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged .	9260.379464816695
GARDINER .	132911.3833977684
and before he went away , an engagement was formed , chiefly through his own and Bennet's means , for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband .	9260.379464816695
you cannot go yourself .	30417.036999547854
That Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham , before his arrival , but without gaining any satisfactory information ;	10608.549258458432
They were in fact very fine ladies ;	18605.234516800505
Well , any friend of Bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure ;	12101.48344089954
Come , let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly .	10608.549258458432
I am , dear Sir , c .	18605.234516800505
or , as the happiest alternative , been secluded from the world , in some distant farm house .	10834.408731294176
And how impossible in others !	24639.09342595445
but of the truth of what I shall relate , I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity .	10407.310844156898
Nay , if you are so serious about it , I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled .	10834.408731294176
Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity , a warmth , a delight , which words could but poorly express .	10407.310844156898
At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ;	9782.87932956929
but from what the report of their engagement could originate , Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ;	10834.408731294176
my dear brother , replied Bennet , that is exactly what I could most wish for .	11380.291625061673
Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude , but said nothing .	13096.286853076666
it is very hard to think that she might have been Collins's wife by this time , had not it been for her own perverseness .	9660.348753098539
He could not speak a word for full ten minutes .	14551.04788507868
If this be the case , he deserves you .	15559.850453513078
His attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect ;	15559.850453513078
It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast ;	13748.703918533663
I am sure you will be very comfortable there .	15559.850453513078
At length the Parsonage was discernible .	21038.055088401863
so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as your's seems to have been .	12101.48344089954
I am afraid you will be angry .	18605.234516800505
He certainly looked at her friend a great deal , but the expression of that look was disputable .	10834.408731294176
She was less handsome than her brother , but there was sense and good humour in her face , and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle .	9444.469146293983
London : Printed for T Egerton , Military Library , Whitehall .	13748.703918533663
and she parted from him convinced , that whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing .	9782.87932956929
I often tell my other girls they are nothing to her .	13748.703918533663
Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction and a moment's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible , she sat down again , and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion .	8175.953084916759
I am not afraid of you , said he , smilingly .	13748.703918533663
I do not think it is very pretty ;	16863.15364986961
Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he ?	12101.48344089954
1 .	132911.3833977684
but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing , and between herself and Elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to .	9782.87932956929
MY DEAR NIECE , I have just received your letter , and shall devote this whole morning to answering it , as I foresee that a little writing will not comprise what I have to tell you .	8733.768489132548
and , though Kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense , since the disturbers of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended , was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance , by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp .	7993.065613794534
That is capital , added her sister , and they both laughed heartily .	12555.954772759242
Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer , as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces .	9547.944950839816
The girls grieved over such a number of ladies ;	15559.850453513078
said Elizabeth .	63582.78435607402
Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity , are not worth a regret .	10608.549258458432
It is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and interest , for him to be guilty of it .	10064.285584582429
What a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago , would now have been gladly and gratefully received !	8841.534051332943
and I understand from Gardiner , that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all , before she leaves the South .	10064.285584582429
said that she had liked him better when they met in Kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning .	9444.469146293983
We are speaking of music , Madam , said he , when no longer able to avoid a reply .	10608.549258458432
and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you .	11714.159730430352
They are descended on the maternal side , from the same noble line ;	12555.954772759242
And is this all ?	30417.036999547854
They have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression .	11380.291625061673
The boy protested that she should not ;	18605.234516800505
Bennet accepted the challenge , observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements .	10407.310844156898
They have at least that advantage .	21038.055088401863
It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge ;	11714.159730430352
My father began life in the profession which your uncle , Philips , appears to do so much credit to but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late Darcy , and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property .	8338.606959546763
That will not do for a compliment to Darcy , Caroline , cried her brother because he does not write with ease .	10064.285584582429
Adieu .	132911.3833977684
you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner .	15559.850453513078
but intricate characters are the most amusing .	18605.234516800505
grieved shocked .	63582.78435607402
This , she would not hear of ;	18605.234516800505
It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity ;	11714.159730430352
Hope was over , entirely over ;	21038.055088401863
F3 .	132911.3833977684
She longed to enquire of the housekeeper , whether her master were really absent , but had not courage for it .	10226.907161276042
Darcy was punctual in his return , and as Lydia informed you , attended the wedding .	11380.291625061673
It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's interested wishes , and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes , however openly or artfully spoken , could influence a young man so totally independent of every one .	8551.377728427238
I will speak to her about it myself directly .	15559.850453513078
Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley ;	15559.850453513078
and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand .	11089.641563468356
The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new , yet I think it is well expressed .	10608.549258458432
The supposition did not pain her .	21038.055088401863
Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense .	9916.958575084616
The latter was thinking only of his breakfast .	16863.15364986961
Their father then went to the library to write , and the girls walked into the breakfast-room .	11089.641563468356
and then , what do you think we did ?	15559.850453513078
he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it ;	13096.286853076666
and , after a pause of several minutes , was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion , who , in a manner , which though it spoke compassion , spoke likewise restraint , said , I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing , concern .	7820.474470359164
and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added , I have never had a cross word from him in my life , and I have known him ever since he was four years old .	8786.068228923794
Wherever you and Jane are known , you must be respected and valued ;	12555.954772759242
but Darcy can please where he chuses .	18605.234516800505
Only think of that my dear ;	21038.055088401863
and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room , its aspect and its furniture , he addressed himself particularly to her , as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him .	8473.529323869427
They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends , and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family , when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window , and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle , driving up the street .	8067.0762328474575
But it ought to be done , and if you will give me a sheet of paper , it shall be done directly .	9916.958575084616
The least agreeable circumstance in the business , was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet , whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person .	9348.90374178589
And that , said Reynolds , pointing to another of the miniatures , is my master and very like him .	10407.310844156898
I should not be surprised , said Darcy , if he were to give it up , as soon as any eligible purchase offers .	9782.87932956929
I thought him very sly ;	24639.09342595445
When is your turn to come ?	21038.055088401863
'Lady Catherine , ' said she , 'you have given me a treasure .	12555.954772759242
I shall never forget her appearance this morning .	16863.15364986961
But no , recollecting herself , that could never be : my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me : I should not have been allowed to invite them .	9101.568221486219
We passed each other several times .	21038.055088401863
When they all removed to Brighton , therefore , you had no reason , I suppose , to believe them fond of each other .	9782.87932956929
Her reflections were in general satisfactory .	21038.055088401863
The officers will find women better worth their notice .	15559.850453513078
E2 .	132911.3833977684
Let us sit down .	30417.036999547854
With your good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others !	11089.641563468356
While Sir William was with them , Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig , and shewing him the country ;	9782.87932956929
she felt all the compliment it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother .	9547.944950839816
You have sense , and we all expect you to use it .	13096.286853076666
Their other engagements were few ;	24639.09342595445
Change of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home , may be as useful as anything .	10226.907161276042
Oh yes !	63582.78435607402
I often think , said she , that there is nothing so bad as parting with one's friends .	10834.408731294176
Mary had neither genius nor taste ;	21038.055088401863
1813 .	132911.3833977684
You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner in such society ;	10834.408731294176
and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character , in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of Elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end .	8338.606959546763
Elizabeth , for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts , now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since her coming away .	9260.379464816695
repeated Bennet .	63582.78435607402
but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment , had they sat in one equally lively ;	8786.068228923794
Oh !	132911.3833977684
She paused , and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse .	9547.944950839816
And to be kept back on such a motive !	15559.850453513078
