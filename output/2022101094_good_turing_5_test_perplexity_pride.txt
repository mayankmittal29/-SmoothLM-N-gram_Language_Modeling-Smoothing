Average perplexity: 113764.27205190193
I am not at all afraid of her dying .	41047.26705560437
and so accomplished !	76064.55984244646
but without scheming to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery .	117839.7339608008
She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest , by talking of their supposed marriage , and planning his happiness in such an alliance .	144268.91897459762
Hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was very glad ;	105224.03470897266
I told you in the library , you know , that I should never speak to you again , and you will find me as good as my word .	60079.9331515512
The house , furniture , neighbourhood , and roads , were all to her taste , and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most friendly and obliging .	145419.4864851365
and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle directly .	39260.01548844688
If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection , Elizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty .	154444.5401462823
My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness , and in a cause of such moment as this , I shall certainly not depart from it .	107465.48298674833
The pain of separation , however , might be alleviated on his side , by preparations for the reception of his bride , as he had reason to hope , that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire , the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men .	34550.99516413723
No , I thank you ;	32164.425614242176
I have suspected it some time , but I am now convinced .	89225.01189190298
Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again , and weakened her disgust of Collins .	222889.4696482099
It was unpardonable .	58359.5539271585
No , said Colonel Fitzwilliam , that is an advantage which he must divide with me .	66857.94765039222
and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the probability of a rainy season , made her feel that the commonest , dullest , most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker .	97584.45748673192
Their visitors staid with them above half an hour , and when they arose to depart , Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing and Gardiner , and Miss Bennet , to dinner at Pemberley , before they left the country .	99344.81896692853
But upon my honour I do not .	166521.359855097
She blushed , and Jane blushed ;	101993.0949752934
I promised them so faithfully !	163250.05715486564
which are naturally lively enough .	263312.34394730796
It was a subject , in short , on which reflection would be long indulged , and must be unavailing .	47131.05049614146
The rooms were lofty and handsome , and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor ;	151004.8325866169
and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour Lady Lucas .	64830.394800608046
but Darcy , at whom it was all aimed , was still inflexibly studious .	112556.16285651698
What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosing's Park , when he put his letter into her hand !	77215.27079948048
Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas , for Collins was only a clergyman ;	66871.75375356787
The Collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave ;	154349.37859903564
Do you consider the forms of introduction , and the stress that is laid on them , as nonsense ?	105119.72043818064
As for Jane , her anxiety under this suspence was , of course , more painful than Elizabeth's ;	106608.43882546383
Indeed !	15945.850060918196
and I particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at Netherfield , '_She a beauty !	101288.13136455312
I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well , I assure you .	29756.327665352746
and , perhaps , if I have very good luck , I may meet with another Collins in time .	100600.47847280106
From herself to Jane from Jane to Bingley , her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Darcy's explanation there , had appeared very insufficient ;	154184.512375862
My father , however , is partial to Wickham .	93541.17640724037
The dejection was almost universal .	177085.84924283982
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper ;	56984.867799882864
But in spite of all this fine talking , my dear Lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured , that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair .	45042.76908560664
No why should he ?	216104.35799354975
As Gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she and her children should go to London , at the same time that Bennet came from it .	109104.3891637429
Yet , how just a humiliation !	102326.30791414919
Nay , when I read a letter of his , I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham , much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law .	117275.27359979844
Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ?	48853.47939662891
Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and which he thought the prettiest ?	176494.9257115042
In the afternoon , the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves ;	72462.57288214802
He has children of his own , and may have more .	94443.82554182998
Family pride , and filial pride , for he is very proud of what his father was , have done this .	201850.22994999238
It was to this effect : Since writing the above , dearest Lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ;	53926.40875745502
Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield , which was fixed for the following Tuesday .	114518.06228689424
This was his plan of amends of atonement for inheriting their father's estate ;	99134.02397963777
and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached .	111532.37534622422
If you will thank me , he replied , let it be for yourself alone .	64751.15454387194
I hope he will overlook it .	82534.98792750527
Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her .	98552.98301749876
that he should have been in love with her for so many months !	104324.71167632239
She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting .	54843.330284441574
and as she considered that Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations , and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct , she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before .	76085.76709512614
Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again ?	104580.75131279441
She was ashamed to think how much .	77471.67832006904
Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends ?	94952.30350410304
She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference .	95887.74651040339
1813 .	15895.509420740158
Do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart .	109054.050708554
and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer !	93876.5133735937
Did you , on reading it , give any credit to its contents ?	103106.0321759551
When tea was over , Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table but in vain .	93847.61585407976
Yes , he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word .	54897.73206370985
and Elizabeth found , that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations' consent , there was still something to be wished for .	110353.32015833039
and neither the carriage , nor the livery of the servant who preceded it , were familiar to them .	143533.91045857352
Oh , well !	68310.59513407851
for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ;	101626.34512751388
Is nothing due to me on that score ?	202252.6050446142
but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter and said , Jane , I congratulate you .	45553.144412027585
Bennet's best comfort was , that Bingley must be down again in the summer .	103176.60256392094
and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , I never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them .	76682.2846518953
The park paling was still the boundary on one side , and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground .	117412.07273098739
Jane certainly could not come back .	202055.45564247863
To the civil enquiries which then poured in , and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Bingley's , she could not make a very favourable answer .	117618.46625692592
He begged pardon for having displeased her .	103947.82879944237
But she is nothing to me now .	38720.6073579936
Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time .	164346.44806649355
Miss Darcy , on her brother's entrance , exerted herself much more to talk ;	60580.52760274232
He made no answer , and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton .	50096.03609886472
the nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people !	186861.6364162948
If , indeed , it should be so !	97692.43834421108
I cannot fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation .	106151.50677679529
He had rather hoped that all his wife's views on the stranger would be disappointed ;	100079.63342481061
CHAPTER XVI .	4353.740372381362
Her report was highly favourable .	196591.6682419952
Every body said how well she looked ;	95648.23145685214
He seemed scarcely to hear her , and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation ;	71823.04093401713
They were now almost at the door of the house , for she had walked fast to get rid of him ;	43615.439475409694
He is so excessively handsome !	76437.30202368047
for Long has just been here , and she told me all about it .	91301.0123947836
where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure ;	112126.91804592145
Darcy , after enquiring of her how and Gardiner did , a question which she could not answer without confusion , said scarcely any thing .	111081.83196604533
They gradually ascended for half a mile , and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence , where the wood ceased , and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House , situated on the opposite side of a valley , into which the road with some abruptness wound .	114501.7256175553
He was too happy , however , to need much attention ;	89835.53546696005
Why Jane you never dropt a word of this ;	194009.37592959256
It was all pride and insolence .	36088.51661656203
How does Georgiana get on , Darcy ?	188034.3594974945
At such a distance as that , you know , things are strangely misrepresented .	60358.75405713084
and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted .	107678.61602502495
We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured .	51616.68424158661
pray make haste and come into the dining-room , for there is such a sight to be seen !	120760.44528297562
When they were gone , Elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent .	57855.75813824872
My dear Eliza he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way .	71093.48638514055
Her ease and good spirits increased .	189990.40807227822
Elizabeth , who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Darcy had been , was much relieved by discerning such different feelings .	61205.45755448561
Oh , yes !	1630.3553256278274
, but its volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous locations .	260903.2222302878
Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship , in spite of a great opposition of character .	180620.3921907489
said Charlotte , as soon as he was gone .	97397.13910587975
There is also one other person in the party , he continued after a pause , who more particularly wishes to be known to you , Will you allow me , or do I ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton ?	76934.34133557294
When a woman has five grown up daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty .	158470.45638761067
cried his wife impatiently .	227027.97203066145
Neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude , replied Elizabeth , have any possible claim on me , in the present instance .	170301.4758568803
and addressed herself particularly to Bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation .	138293.60192787275
His manners are very different from his cousin's .	181920.92115538375
But it is so strange !	29761.232911730443
About ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire , to which he belonged .	160630.96360496804
And pray what sort of guardians do you make ?	107154.78999613937
Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in my dressing-room .	105453.74341874085
Can you possibly guess , Lizzy , who is meant by this ?	104332.14798269069
You may depend upon my not mentioning it .	3840.9239362702397
and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs .	115053.53480690118
and to prevent its ever happening again , took care to inform him at first , that it was a favourite haunt of hers .	79416.81861123143
certainly , cried his faithful assistant , no one can be really esteemed accomplished , who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with .	118612.27852511064
He was writing , and , without raising his head , coolly replied , Just as you please .	100168.67367449559
March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford .	322900.5873419373
Bennet was perfectly satisfied ;	75352.98030288043
When the gentlemen rose to go away , Bennet was mindful of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time .	87710.00801967832
that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking Darcy's character , though he had assured her that respect for the father , would always prevent his exposing the son .	88756.28918998156
His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost .	98211.66551814851
I have not the smallest hope .	5568.829380572345
She coloured as she spoke ;	174753.56918779074
She opened the door , and met Maria in the landing place , who , breathless with agitation , cried out , Oh , my dear Eliza !	100654.73471679578
There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed .	61449.33979589844
You shall hear what she says .	14321.989659157192
I do not see what right Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend's inclination , or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy .	89663.48075750633
A few weeks , he believed .	102041.3377359713
But think no more of the letter .	166521.359855097
When is your next ball to be , Lizzy ?	180386.72299144787
You see how continually we are engaged there .	105652.13597078013
Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours ;	322900.5873419373
You know I always speak my mind , and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves .	77184.37320092095
See paragraph 1 .	321954.1981687595
I am happier even than Jane ;	69275.4802314674
but it must be done soon .	5376.977372055333
they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence ;	49002.857610277206
if it must be so , it must .	93298.43392056509
I should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match , cried Elizabeth .	43264.79408386687
She followed her father to the fire place , and they both sat down .	112555.83901768789
We have judged it best , that my niece should be married from this house , of which I hope you will approve .	109858.54442766821
and , after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable composure .	50370.35677830697
Yes , she will remain there till Christmas .	19659.99997837021
Special rules , set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license , apply to copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark .	130485.99999999908
and Gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing , by the servant's account , that their niece was taken suddenly ill ;	114537.49539190407
Remember , Eliza , that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do .	202823.83794621326
but I think I shall like your husband quite as well as Jane's .	32344.116439604302
I do not think we were speaking at all .	19270.80117978055
Well , cried her mother , it is all very right ;	13797.821101931022
and Hurst , principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings , joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss Bennet .	118237.82467536136
Yet he is such a man !	102326.30791414919
You have delighted us long enough .	80680.64819991625
Bennet could hardly contain herself .	99779.90039651675
Be that as it may , she saw him go with regret ;	204964.66891210558
She had even learnt to detect , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary .	82362.19057933356
dear me !	360431.60379160364
when it was no longer likely they should meet .	107424.3234403358
but with the rich , he is liberal-minded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and perhaps agreeable , allowing something for fortune and figure .	115398.41837781678
and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him .	89497.77976247987
You blamed me for coming ?	182261.32135213114
Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield ;	97683.75323140393
and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look .	111063.48209981663
Have you any idea , Lizzy , who this gentleman is ?	52937.89266345289
It was not in her nature , however , to increase her vexations , by dwelling on them .	27284.071474051485
and even Darcy acknowledged , that the partridges were remarkably well done ;	102947.7260486108
There is something very pompous in his style .	45611.45877903756
You certainly do , she replied with a smile ;	166722.04249097858
and though Collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as I have often told her , to come to Rosings every day , and play on the piano-forte in Jenkinson's room .	111970.86307912177
Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to conciliate her .	147524.12560827142
and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet .	58078.895485696994
They contained no actual complaint , nor was there any revival of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering .	152446.616188796
Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage ;	45478.9346471396
Kitty was the only one who shed tears ;	105862.53858755947
And then you have added so much to it yourself , you are always buying books .	107492.2458051638
This cannot be !	1853.3918414790764
and Elizabeth , who knew what curiosities his letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise .	72126.48608355456
When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer , I made a point of her having two men servants go with her .	117860.45550315664
Elizabeth , on her side , had much to do .	43268.51027413977
The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a headache ;	155719.81663535393
Indeed , Jane , you ought to believe me .	94527.89141512991
And so would Anne , if her health had allowed her to apply .	100326.31695211906
I will read it to you When my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to London , might be concluded in three or four days , but as we are certain it cannot be so , and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town , he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel .	69679.9456005866
They entered it in one of its lowest points , and drove for some time through a beautiful wood , stretching over a wide extent .	118625.08139971975
May we take my uncle's letter to read to her ?	216866.9597987474
When the card tables were placed , he had an opportunity of obliging her in return , by sitting down to whist .	71102.30660322958
After a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display .	121672.35137819804
but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands .	26352.434816899022
he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and that , if he marry prudently , his wife may teach him .	159023.86103742637
and Bennet , for many years after Lydia's birth , had been certain that he would .	64936.962869288094
and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements , new carriages and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield , in the course of three or four months .	107287.04246286958
hatred had vanished long ago , and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him , that could be so called .	186457.9935938899
But I will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well .	31304.85637295839
If his own vanity , however , did not mislead him , he was the cause , his pride and caprice were the cause of all that Jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer .	111237.64694764587
I fancy , Lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all .	114075.13435795122
Their affectionate mother shared all their grief ;	199790.94634652406
a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room .	98887.35444790438
Pray , how violent was Bingley's love ?	98785.8983153414
but Lady Catherine very resolutely , and not very politely , declined eating any thing ;	152386.4420487778
Now what have you to say ?	229629.03392067464
and in front , a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater , but without any artificial appearance .	104059.48472305496
He carved , and ate , and praised with delighted alacrity ;	160409.77372134858
E5 .	702034.9987130143
But though every thing seemed neat and comfortable , she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance ;	116952.78291680584
When I am in the country , he replied , I never wish to leave it ;	39218.311606559735
It only shews her being deficient in something herself sense or feeling .	158074.33991353045
Yes , very well .	26830.923270149735
and , though she was not very sanguine in expecting it , the application was a something to look forward to .	48890.534500469934
Is this a hint to me , Lizzy , said her father , to send for the horses ?	27261.051563003628
and more than commonly anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her .	72372.30034892372
However , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts , and I am very glad to hear what you tell us , of long sleeves .	60895.18597304036
you know he is , as well as I do ;	54054.192898134475
Pray forgive me , if I have been very presuming , or at least do not punish me so far , as to exclude me from P I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park .	116750.93698212314
Your idea of the ponies is delightful .	196241.15135600098
then recollecting himself , I will not detain you a minute , but let me , or let the servant , go after and Gardiner .	169604.4311492744
In the first place , he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron .	37137.16022181857
but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you .	45587.604990909786
Bennet could not have chosen better .	102035.93232660535
and know them to be so much attached to me !	151438.64977854845
Her sister made not the smallest objection , and the piano-forte was opened , and Darcy , after a few moments recollection , was not sorry for it .	61796.103275033776
Elizabeth was surprised , but said not a word .	4635.9318318472715
CHAPTER X More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park , unexpectedly meet Darcy .	114775.33194279236
They have none of them much to recommend them , replied he ;	54147.80988355609
After walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on resuming their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant , there chanced to be a little alteration .	121980.53063836323
and Collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much .	150117.88804207995
and yet it should seem by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy .	78446.99738726173
I dare say you believed it ;	14470.34289600243
You are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on ;	97124.35593580527
nothing , therefore , could be fairly conjectured from that , though Elizabeth , who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings , was perfectly aware , that , had she known nothing of Darcy , she could have borne the dread of Lydia's infamy somewhat better .	133025.36723372975
her voice was weak , and her manner affected .	209230.30399014073
Would you believe it , Lizzy , that when he went to town last November , he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent , would have prevented his coming down again !	156961.38329988826
he kissed it with affectionate gallantry , though he hardly knew how to look , and they entered the house .	161461.82652556777
The particulars , I reserve till we meet .	165869.0280785322
and she looked on the whole scene , the river , the trees scattered on its banks , and the winding of the valley , as far as she could trace it , with delight .	91106.2134668979
It was an animating subject , and Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match .	69276.62506064
Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ;	158477.2328839287
Neither could any thing be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities which Darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach .	121185.97445387919
She then sought her eldest sister , who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley .	105870.51841458459
From Collins !	276509.25277176953
Will you do me the honour of reading that letter ?	100329.98039073037
So , Lizzy , said he one day , your sister is crossed in love I find .	111556.32271122216
Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately ;	48893.35341898891
There was no want of discourse .	34945.39169040114
His coming into the country at all , is a most insolent thing indeed , and I wonder how he could presume to do it .	48493.724997738565
So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him !	196056.43527876405
and he was obliged to walk about the room , while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences .	76697.0920600693
How well it sounds .	209816.29031915142
It should not be said , that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers .	145351.23920963125
and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself ;	77956.63798893796
They found Bennet still up .	99753.17207387366
and they conversed with so much spirit and flow , as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself , as well as of Darcy .	82703.70518793074
But it is , returned she ;	33662.29089250205
He shook his head .	57074.388874762386
His daughter's request , for such it might be considered , of being admitted into her family again , before she set off for the North , received at first an absolute negative .	147018.0442552785
Stop me whilst you can .	380728.3208931227
Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure , and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming , when she found herself so affectionately received .	106394.09980559457
Is it possible !	87189.89722405425
Let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ;	106021.16674153511
He delighted in going to Pemberley , especially when he was least expected .	156961.1616827752
I had no notion but he would go a shooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company .	108965.18445622842
Elizabeth was in agonies .	68516.9111729965
Your uncle is as much surprised as I am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned , would have allowed him to act as he has done .	120493.9963465317
This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted : and Elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away .	112869.93989942918
Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to his wife ?	190197.95298977083
On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects .	57683.3113018563
An express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from Colonel Forster , to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers ;	116234.12145604209
This has been my motive , my fair cousin , and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem .	101908.0314924373
You ought certainly to forgive them as a christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing .	119919.4598223815
I will not encourage the impudence of either , by receiving them at Longbourn .	58546.05483244553
The next morning , however , made an alteration ;	10211.2288968762
Charlotte is an excellent manager , I dare say .	50182.027495859285
It is evident by this , added Jane , that he comes back no more this winter .	68775.03586081754
To be sure that did seem as if he admired her indeed I rather believe he did I heard something about it but I hardly know what something about Robinson .	60356.93319772907
With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ;	166774.89422537683
When she remembered the style of his address , she was still full of indignation ;	104368.66217505849
When first Bennet had married , economy was held to be perfectly useless ;	111713.8878350333
The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came , and Bennet was forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle , was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth .	123407.24644818425
can it be really so !	380728.3208931227
She had never seen a place for which nature had done more , or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste .	79582.54981574742
I hope , added Gardiner , that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her .	68678.98978762784
what can have induced him to behave so cruelly ?	203423.3042559681
Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications .	158816.2856670046
His eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity ;	162845.74061431966
As soon as all had ate , and the elder ones paid , the carriage was ordered ;	63914.89456022897
You know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself .	103966.69012322328
Let me hear what it is .	38355.48344554815
He meant , I believe , replied Jane , to go to Epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the postilions , and try if any thing could be made out from them .	119869.59120485013
observed Bennet .	568865.2538408812
and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible .	25170.94253119625
The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic .	157256.80118594386
My overhearings were more to the purpose than yours , Eliza , said Charlotte .	161724.00898744576
his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had .	113627.25349760769
said Elizabeth .	4797.661801655704
The first mentioned was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , I had detached Bingley from your sister , and the other , that I had , in defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , ruined the immediate prosperity , and blasted the prospects of Wickham .	100630.02238888096
Darcy is all politeness , said Elizabeth , smiling .	99606.83473825555
said Jane .	4751.986131603042
It was some days , however , before they received any invitation thither , for while there were visitors in the house , they could not be necessary ;	82899.8907226519
Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth and it was soon done done while Bennet was stirring the fire .	116988.28719469963
I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings , and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three , of whom we shall deprive you .	137215.888180191
It taught me to hope , said he , as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before .	102113.98671303949
but since then , we have both , I hope , improved in civility .	108722.08674749103
but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him .	142846.7370691664
When Jane and Elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in her praise of Bingley before , expressed to her sister how very much she admired him .	148792.2798523472
There can be no love in all this .	8059.425049241061
Yet it is hard , she sometimes thought , that this poor man cannot come to a house , which he has legally hired , without raising all this speculation !	120329.38958896585
and Bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice .	42772.201728064494
Good heavens !	300008.03906777303
If I had been able , said she , to carry my point of going to Brighton , with all my family , this would not have happened ;	82956.4021403123
Indeed I had .	81416.27846291792
and in the mean time , she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married , to Hill and the two housemaids .	78490.13368196263
Lydia's being settled in the North , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment ;	153632.46186890814
The younger ones out before the elder are married !	107145.78229996747
My excellent father died about five years ago ;	177305.3703963421
We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening , said Elizabeth .	64475.78106045806
And if you will stay another month complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London , for I am going there early in June , for a week ;	69308.44889054622
Lizzy , you must not do so .	17064.581946009974
Only look at her .	83164.16644628772
and the Hursts have no horses to theirs .	82922.7644441298
She directly replied , You need not be frightened .	161657.60917981522
How nicely we are crammed in !	193847.40423150142
The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning's impatience .	155719.81663535393

Lizzy , when you first read that letter , I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now .	78290.62985689366
but her's she thought was still worse .	167653.42428877368
and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty .	103868.89346610876
But does Lydia know nothing of this ?	103943.95848926246
She counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent ;	154529.15088203413
Can such abominable pride as his , have ever done him good ?	186753.0620515566
Oh !	8965.45062507954
Good Heaven !	4369.663431489112
Have all her friends left her ?	229629.03392067464
Their brother , indeed , was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency .	115985.07099380437
The colour which had been driven from her face , returned for half a minute with an additional glow , and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes , as she thought for that space of time , that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken .	123657.79775626943
Pardon me .	82675.60364217014
My dear , dear Lizzy , I would I do congratulate you but are you certain ?	37308.081482260815
Her father had been an attorney in Meryton , and had left her four thousand pounds .	66985.01348577825
She had fully proposed being engaged by Wickham for those very dances : and to have Collins instead !	100028.62644224225
I am so grieved for him .	36081.35432317263
She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together .	70425.93166568303
no , I certainly am not .	96626.65357155188
You quite mistook Darcy .	188454.96080479727
but this is the true one .	91447.28814553979
Yes , in conjunction with his friend .	32295.278761365542
and still different from either , was what Bennet sent to Collins , in reply to his last .	115359.81721260313
Bingley was every thing that was charming , except the professed lover of her daughter .	102307.15337565058
They repulsed every attempt of Bennet at conversation , and by so doing , threw a languor over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Collins , who was complimenting Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests .	138927.14785316374
As all conversation was thereby at an end , Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room .	165395.21485301864
Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject ;	176564.73513062025
When first he came in , he had spoken to her but little ;	60098.96046438351
If it is designedly done , they cannot be justified ;	98493.02964576769
But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both .	136119.69380470726
and , as they drew near the appointed inn where Bennet's carriage was to meet them , they quickly perceived , in token of the coachman's punctuality , both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs .	91798.78688478963
What , none of you ?	90289.36593164477
Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman , and required information ;	167837.54696356165
Well , my comfort is , I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done .	20746.285235235122
Too much , I am afraid ;	348225.77321067615
This was very amiable , but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any conception of ;	102919.23106037048
His family knew him to be on all common occasions , a most negligent and dilatory correspondent , but at such a time , they had hoped for exertion .	108575.8648568393
His first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance , as far as it would go .	142226.29105938305
She wanted to talk , but there seemed an embargo on every subject .	57930.25076837671
In every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived .	162950.99234722732
but on perceiving Darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner .	112290.02438787825
She was more alive to the disgrace , which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham , a fortnight before they took place .	112963.16342822129
and Gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in London the very next day , and would assist Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia .	120531.86082385041
And then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you ;	70848.39857321791
As for Elizabeth , her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last ;	64848.08574379792
They are not married , nor can I find there was any intention of being so ;	102446.79240319662
for you are really proud of your defects in writing , because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution , which if not estimable , you think at least highly interesting .	93359.74997853281
You never will be able to make both of them good for any thing .	112559.97101410835
They walked towards the Lucases , because Kitty wished to call upon Maria ;	111695.87026648155
But you see that Jane , said her aunt , does not think so ill of Wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt .	25507.365330620265
I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ;	105405.32839820394
it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it .	99473.6900715201
The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend , assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London , might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment .	140153.07399481343
She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either , or make either appear to advantage .	110948.73557671053
You allude perhaps to the entail of this estate .	166722.04249097858
She could not win him , however , to any conversation ;	49584.97217622094
by her ease and liveliness , his mind might have been softened , his manners improved , and from his judgment , information , and knowledge of the world , she must have received benefit of greater importance .	170540.18686666113
Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone .	104185.61542684566
I enquired after their brother , of course .	67082.33723808991
Bennet could hardly comprehend it .	99779.90039651675
and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both .	68606.16542346166
Dear me !	342619.010840163
by reason , by reflection , by every thing .	286155.114637121
to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed , and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation , console herself for the present , and prepare for another disappointment .	117484.08960310947
During dinner , Bennet scarcely spoke at all ;	245027.04919456103
To convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself , was no very difficult point .	162020.50522915833
my daughters are brought up differently .	221760.45116817416
and after listening a moment , she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry , and calling loudly after her .	108265.84274510833
Why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent , said she , did he come at all ?	111047.48137408614
I do think it is the hardest thing in the world , that your estate should be entailed away from your own children ;	56824.84663128464
Bennet treasured up the hint , and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married ;	162586.30225060126
Do you know Bingley ?	76008.92945586964
Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy .	108494.6492881734
and very unwillingly said so .	99727.79709125662
Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter ;	180993.47397181974
Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not .	104459.7487520938
He had been some time with Gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river , and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning .	78401.06310694602
He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies , of whose beauty he had heard much ;	106942.48192501637
Good God !	300008.03906777303
Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever .	110658.68151069609
Something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them , but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life .	119912.64808459916
it came from Netherfield , and was opened immediately .	4635.4111935062
They have each their advantages , and I can be equally happy in either .	106550.96653440145
She was wild to be at home to hear , to see , to be upon the spot , to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her , in a family so deranged ;	112241.48926586064
In making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self-reproach .	145423.20734284972
CHAPTER I Elizabeth , as they drove along , watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation ;	116486.94429661414
Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance ;	96571.63536338638
And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton , of whom I shall subjoin a list , according to his information .	85652.4254162205
But make a virtue of it by all means .	73504.09759704307
Arguments are too much like disputes .	348225.77321067615
I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , Lizzy ?	110718.25360663919
The rest of the evening passed with the appearance , on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no farther attempt to distinguish Elizabeth ;	38588.051159956085
I believe , Ma'am , I may safely promise you never to dance with him .	105298.00957958923
No , no .	22002.294141974806
and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least .	90503.89875805443
At length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself .	21653.691067309082
She followed him with her eyes , envied every one to whom he spoke , had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee ;	79845.02512627479
I never saw such a long chin in my life .	5968.521836071322
I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield .	19859.721449307042
cried Elizabeth ;	67162.84700494641
but this was all lost upon me .	42252.71425307279
No , Kitty , I have at last learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it .	104963.16526005822
The principal purport of his letter was to inform them , that Wickham had resolved on quitting the Militia .	149250.80834095218
I shall be very fit to see Jane which is all I want .	57976.90083705849
When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford , every eye was in search of the Parsonage , and every turning expected to bring it in view .	115159.62218545236
her complexion has no brilliancy ;	248423.1713320854
said her mother as soon as she was in the hall .	30175.175112283825
They will join me early to-morrow , he continued , and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you , Bingley and his sisters .	113848.3752500868
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity .	80226.03000023101
I do not mind his not talking to Long , said Miss Lucas , but I wish he had danced with Eliza .	46161.11540195488
but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder .	98061.62408323796
Yes , there can ;	29946.615242539705
If you received the work electronically , the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund .	19763.311342672438
Make haste , make haste .	34177.74050160044
My reasons for believing it are briefly these : It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance , or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable .	144184.20145702295
After amusing himself some time with their curiosity , he thus explained .	176121.4186981453
I had not believed it possible .	33685.91399682309
Forgive me ;	90158.3850745545
This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself .	51503.753909989486
Darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say something indistinctly of his concern , and observe her in compassionate silence .	108463.69216036524
At length there was nothing more to be said ;	92825.79097533887
Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ;	185934.25974669773
She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room .	83132.37959427372
But at least it shews , that she was serious in the object of her journey .	110540.08583064501
but , exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone .	105878.89973870729
Elizabeth quietly answered Undoubtedly ;	188565.09803281122
Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic ;	196241.15135600098
You must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course .	17001.454057341074
I can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ;	101260.09467504089
Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming .	180061.969427006
I dare say she will ;	29864.925954479375
But self , though it would intrude , could not engross her .	155615.05370649425
His temptation is not adequate to the risk .	181920.92115538375
a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point , without being resented .	180230.55552498155
Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal from the shire , as clearly as Gardiner could do .	111435.84088097917
To Bennet's acknowledgments he briefly replied , with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family ;	156907.30307847276
When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned , in terms of such mortifying , yet merited reproach , her sense of shame was severe .	115335.2550825611
He is now gone into the army , she added , but I am afraid he has turned out very wild .	31615.882616408537
and , after giving each of them an hasty kiss , hurried into the vestibule , where Jane , who came running down stairs from her mother's apartment , immediately met her .	86040.51979311847
Take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one .	204964.66891210558
I am most seriously displeased .	34189.78483070206
When they ascended the steps to the hall , Maria's alarm was every moment increasing , and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm .	112862.0732324527
My feelings will not be repressed .	96288.03080707182
Nor was Darcy's vindication , though grateful to her feelings , capable of consoling her for such discovery .	112320.33530978751
All that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds , secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ;	93399.02048454226
My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other .	81724.90017111793
She has known him only a fortnight .	89809.72436639185
I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being .	112472.78110989218
and Elizabeth , as they waited for the housekeeper , had leisure to wonder at her being where she was .	45850.31418764515
Elizabeth , though expecting no less , thanked him with tears of gratitude ;	60140.666070151216
I am sick of them all .	14324.242684740388
You shall not , for the sake of one individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that selfishness is prudence , and insensibility of danger , security for happiness .	73445.68526897657
Elizabeth now began to revive .	99740.96499331556
She received him with her very best politeness , which he returned with as much more , apologising for his intrusion , without any previous acquaintance with her , which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice .	137789.51799182742
Very nonsensical to come at all !	223418.7604267125
Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to identify , do copyright research on , transcribe and proofread public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm collection .	119614.99148036164
From that moment I observed my friend's behaviour attentively ;	194763.83543348784
One enjoyment was certain that of suitableness as companions ;	199443.5798680364
And if I am that choice , why may not I accept him ?	60087.25991088465
D The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you can do with this work .	205265.69620835324
Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival , that Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine ;	108767.7451332335
Elizabeth smiled .	90180.92456243417
Such doings discomposed Bennet exceedingly .	230983.91869274198
My sister , who is more than ten years my junior , was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew , Colonel Fitzwilliam , and myself .	104001.13779168863
It suddenly struck her that it might be from lady Catherine ;	159867.88428390597
E8 .	15895.509420740158
Let Wickham be your man .	221937.6880870776
She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it .	69095.5427664544
At last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance of Darcy , with such a smile over the face , as she remembered to have sometimes seen , when he looked at her .	121435.97224375662
and whenever they changed their quarters , either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to , for some little assistance towards discharging their bills .	116419.22707533558
But I must write no more .	38246.00813070051
and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation .	146163.33393889942
Write to me very often , my dear .	130486.00000000048
She could see him instantly before her , in every charm of air and address ;	100439.76054051566
But , really , I know not what to say .	89009.10503762876
and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it , to Ramsgate ;	146163.33393889942
His plan did not vary on seeing them .	181920.92115538375
Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ?	95649.66372026282
just enough to make one good sort of man ;	130486.00000000048
and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been ;	102947.1894079177
Poor Jane !	304619.8773505858
The more I see of the world , the more am I dissatisfied with it ;	87384.26228149541
He and his sisters were well , I hope , when you left London .	155518.0456602165
International donations are gratefully accepted , but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States .	89031.87242005357
CHAPTER III .	4747.787542098787
Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect , that the sight of such rooms , so many servants , and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them .	115232.34710947177
Don't keep coughing so , Kitty , for heaven's sake !	226468.4803925719
Under such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief .	130486.00000000025
and at that moment she felt , that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something !	105405.47836404208
Lord , how ashamed I should be of not being married before three and twenty !	107566.98215820907
She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure .	94441.42928169183
nor could she for many hours , learn to think of it less than incessantly .	36995.55583902491
You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness ;	154215.92258244372
His consenting to marry her is a proof , I will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking .	102055.46657823853
To-morrow fortnight .	568865.2538408812
but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other , of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that Denny had brought him from London , and that he was to have a lieutenant's commission in the shire .	60359.64218939535
It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way .	66801.83804581634
My youngest of all , is lately married , and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds , walking with a young man , who I believe will soon become a part of the family .	91214.64298820843
They were then , with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance , taken into the house ;	105204.65326249818
But Elizabeth , who had not the least inclination to remain with them , laughingly answered , No , no ;	111642.81222535564
and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement .	49774.23165610609
All field sports were over .	229396.4034928127
My style of writing is very different from yours .	173717.94851075442
c .	15895.509420740158
and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror , Gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power .	104949.26093470716
Thus , we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition .	198608.26889199446
She wrote even to Jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her former professions of regard .	114540.385597496
CHAPTER X The day passed much as the day before had done .	110757.22559334045
He merely added , that he should not write again , till he had something of importance to mention .	23447.059663724383
It originated in Gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support , and consequently preferred her husband's .	106392.85358295418
After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with It is your turn to say something now , Darcy .	111018.175453235
and his commendation of every thing would have touched Bennet's heart , but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property .	112153.61155551347
She comes to us to-day .	174753.56918779074
I will not tell you what it is .	41526.59965441515
At length however Bennet had no more to say ;	42328.323142391404
The power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor , and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance .	83491.605510675
Then turning to Bennet , he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon .	183262.15695803426
The subjection in which his father had brought him up , had given him originally great humility of manner , but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head , living in retirement , and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity .	138703.65528172476
From the entrance hall , of which Collins pointed out , with a rapturous air , the fine proportion and finished ornaments , they followed the servants through an anti-chamber , to the room where Lady Catherine , her daughter , and Jenkinson were sitting .	120058.21816342341
and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over .	21783.843757552047
Now , said she , that this first meeting is over , I feel perfectly easy .	75551.04857792999
The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited .	158992.56681794152
After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight , and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear ;	106897.41182122288
What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy ?	182539.25622312355
Lydia was exceedingly fond of him .	91631.16118702396
When coffee was over , Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him ;	162725.37124116722
I do not believe she often sees such at home .	23261.427259871187
A clergyman like you must marry .	73777.93070370064
But gracious me !	185583.47209719752
It was agreed to .	63249.50909744668
But she would not be secure .	14369.339057898233
Though I shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ;	110883.5756006064
You are so strange !	70188.9602339407
Having resolved to do it without loss of time , as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday , and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment , he set about it in a very orderly manner , with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business .	145219.19433192973
E GARDINER .	360431.60379160364
For my own part , she rejoined , I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her .	111717.3000473911
and in the evening Bennet's invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter .	47206.74216417021
Yes , always , she replied , without knowing what she said , for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , I remember hearing you once say , Darcy , that you hardly ever forgave , that your resentment once created was unappeasable .	97541.40957792684
my sweetest Lizzy !	264641.21956375125
And I think you will agree with me , in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece's .	114667.24997903842
Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations ;	94760.13272975704
CHAPTER XVIII .	4353.740372381362
F6 .	702034.9987130143
that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her , and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening .	115548.52232137974
CHAPTER III .	4747.787542098787
What a charming amusement for young people this is , Darcy !	97287.3769392875
I remember , as soon as ever I saw him , when he first came into Hertfordshire last year , I thought how likely it was that you should come together .	120463.55902537031
But it is all , all too late now .	44139.53143091606
and Bennet found , with amazement and horror , that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter .	112633.00756526581
She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse , but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other , and how formal and cold was their manner , whenever they did .	52536.92118807015
No one who has ever seen you together , can doubt his affection .	105444.79791298781
Elizabeth listened as little as she could , but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name .	110952.04541327346
that it should be equally unreserved was impossible .	105757.5848775511
It is because he will not give himself the trouble .	83591.71925070646
Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself , and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam , Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word I say .	142150.8164538864
He is perfectly well behaved , polite , and unassuming , said her uncle .	62514.56155003711
You have reduced him to his present state of poverty , comparative poverty .	96314.94539435537
Nearly three weeks .	347729.76720943226
Oh !	8965.45062507954
His appearance was greatly in his favour ;	186631.1306118173
I have sent for you on an affair of importance .	85084.7939669628
When to these recollections was added the developement of Wickham's character , it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before , were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful .	143525.4163870436
but Ashworth is too far off !	171191.87057913237
She now lost every expectation of pleasure .	167073.9740126511
Miss Bennet , replied her ladyship , in an angry tone , you ought to know , that I am not to be trifled with .	27050.090698027703
for I consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman .	108993.96158857069
On reaching the spacious lobby above , they were shewn into a very pretty sitting-room , lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below ;	84617.97973530958
You know pretty well , I suppose , what has been done for the young people .	102898.5444857051
At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted .	178918.06867718618
I never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong .	100074.43216993094
Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible .	272449.9064281024
Elizabeth silently attended her .	188565.09803281122
Oh , Jane , take care .	14347.26391129641
Oh !	8965.45062507954
' But afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time .	172341.15665576697
She examined into their employments , looked at their work , and advised them to do it differently ;	149179.4714332055
CHAPTER XI .	4353.740372381362
unless you looked up to him as a superior .	234947.42478434136
I have therefore made up my mind to tell you , that I do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare .	76649.27477121023
and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William , in which she was readily joined by Jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of Collins , and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London .	97238.14296116686
Who do you mean , my dear ?	217805.02855081134
Though Bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage .	155717.45996227168
how can it affect them ?	99972.0079927114
They had nothing to accuse him of but pride ;	92110.61661066965
He was coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland : when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey .	113323.55436842296
Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game , except when Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh's being too hot or too cold , or having too much or too little light .	159453.6291882859
but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future .	62992.80774077292

He scarcely ever spoke to her , and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself , were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas , whose civility in listening to him , was a seasonable relief to them all , and especially to her friend .	105483.93029078713
CHAPTER VIII .	4353.740372381362
When at length they arose to take leave , Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn ;	152621.54512777543
I could see him with perfect indifference , but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of .	110737.21150417901
I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes .	42250.38186897453
and the two , who were most anxiously expected , to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen , were in very good time .	105604.36025306176
No one but Bennet , regretted that their stay would be so short ;	60103.06193438182
Lydia has no brothers to step forward ;	211555.90707948533
CHAPTER XII .	4353.740372381362
Well , mamma , said she , when they were all returned to the breakfast room , and what do you think of my husband ?	56835.75937421425
'Tis as good as a Lord !	256883.70059721987
forgive the question are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ?	235148.4465896886
and therefore gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent , his actions were capable of a very different construction ;	117509.9490254298
But what is that to me ?	38218.34442365171
a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade .	167748.45609466956
To fortune I am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since I am well aware that it could not be complied with ;	149279.482233668
Girls , can I do any thing for you in Meryton ?	260903.2222302878
[ Illustration : Morning Dress .	32090.53701352718
But the wife of Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation , that she could , upon the whole , have no cause to repine .	82188.08292662869
Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table , and they went up stairs together .	109674.49377918671
Your alliance will be a disgrace ;	203029.39959684623
I have every reason in the world to think ill of you .	89225.01189190298
Elizabeth immediately recognising the livery , guessed what it meant , and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations , by acquainting them with the honour which she expected .	120468.13633574906
At present , indeed , they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood ;	55605.416623327415
The world has been deceived in that respect ;	105648.07583178842
Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility ;	107149.70828965754
He must write his own sermons ;	93073.54947943098
which will not be yours till after your mother's decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to .	175615.62792322604
She stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation , and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery .	146976.70004847145
Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ?	107785.55234837391
Miss Darcy's praise occupied the chief of it .	186498.1008669753
Recovering himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said , Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of .	130485.99999999932
Is her husband , is the son of his late father's steward , to be his brother ?	170379.4009756659
Lady Catherine approached , and , after listening for a few minutes , said to Darcy , Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss , if she practised more , and could have the advantage of a London master .	90911.53378524889
but Sir William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane , who were dancing together .	88543.59744185081
How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell , but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you .	152091.28633676431
Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother .	80736.68010199607
Certainly , replied Elizabeth there are such people , but I hope I am not one of them .	42595.83918998001
See paragraph 1 .	321954.1981687595
I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did .	66860.10868656561
Had his own happiness , however , been the only sacrifice , he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best ;	86371.03323692035
And with a bow to Darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room .	82535.0669891649
She would not betray her trust , I suppose , without bribery and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be found .	80944.83721839373
but they were now necessary , and she assured him with some confusion , of her attachment to Darcy .	115933.30237706908
All was acknowledged , and half the night spent in conversation .	109802.38692594321
If we are ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been , said Elizabeth , and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what Gardiner has done for them , because Wickham has not sixpence of his own .	103302.13488875104
Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father .	272449.9064281024
Hunsford , near Westerham , Kent , 15th October .	286155.114637121
Bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from London , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time .	116481.48268859362
and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life .	79906.14294257632
I would keep a pack of foxhounds , and drink a bottle of wine every day .	103402.16588966495
Now , seriously , what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence ?	107904.67663905967
and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to elope with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ;	92641.28095902342
Must it be so ?	423760.34159636457
These bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had I with greater policy concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified , unalloyed inclination ;	155483.28304214496
I hope she will turn out well .	85494.87441810788
Teaze him laugh at him .	290968.435294941
She danced four dances with him at Meryton ;	105646.59542191777
While the contents of the first letter remained on her mind , she was all surprise all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl , whom it was impossible he could marry for money ;	121276.41578316249
Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start , and before he could recover himself enough to speak , she , in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's situation , hastily exclaimed , I beg your pardon , but I must leave you .	91675.77626386964
I know not , Miss Elizabeth , said he , whether Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us , but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it .	96027.26793527008
And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection .	113994.94348222118
Any place would do , of about three or four hundred a year ;	195924.70325255615
The note was immediately dispatched , and its contents as quickly complied with .	155719.81663535393
and when it closed , Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon Charlotte's degree of contentment , to understand her address in guiding , and composure in bearing with her husband , and to acknowledge that it was all done very well .	116409.18072182625
But no letter appeared , and she was completely puzzled .	103873.13808639959
This was a lucky idea of mine , indeed !	22335.20264849852
but it is not sound .	30410.11163700289
What is his name ?	83209.81438483096
Reynolds , either from pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister .	174195.17524917336
Her look and manners were open , cheerful and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and I remained convinced from the evening's scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment .	141632.90278486232
Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer , and forced his younger sister to be civil also , and say what the occasion required .	110053.37766355196
Every thing that is charming !	88677.9005504908
and after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do , which was the more probable from the time of year .	86184.17134424936
Brother-in-law of Wickham !	483014.2116389777
Happy shall I be , when his stay at Netherfield is over !	213011.4231774679
Miss Darcy was tall , and on a larger scale than Elizabeth ;	102986.78631388453
At present we have nothing to guide us .	94657.98061773895
The account of his connection with the Pemberley family , was exactly what he had related himself ;	54219.96103257612
Your sisters are engaged , and there is not another woman in the room , whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with .	152520.02354705991
When I wrote that letter , replied Darcy , I believed myself perfectly calm and cool , but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit .	115919.42411297532
The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth , as the first .	151004.8325866169
We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Wickham with money .	104272.99270453918
As soon as they had driven from the door , Elizabeth was called on by her cousin , to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings , which , for Charlotte's sake , she made more favourable than it really was .	60404.51541365562
They may wish many things besides his happiness ;	100558.3777933576
I must conclude , for I cannot be long from my poor mother .	97707.19695820671
cried Elizabeth , brightening up for a moment .	40902.047058881355
But however he did not .	99733.7249916516
Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Hurst or Miss Bingley ;	160101.64832427626
Your friend performs delightfully ;	221798.1568070318
and the valley , here contracted into a glen , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it .	108265.85377507212
They could talk of nothing but officers ;	95536.48640471125
Their conduct has been such , replied Elizabeth , as neither you , nor I , nor any body , can ever forget .	157942.96289453364
She had obtained private intelligence that Darcy did not wish for cards ;	91547.06687967286
why is not every body as happy ?	257195.89845498506
nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable .	101556.55963943782
He had never before supposed that , could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter , it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself , as by the present arrangement .	51210.48867447222
Kitty stared at him , and Lydia exclaimed .	206897.16276330984
Elizabeth could not help saying , It is very much to his credit , I am sure , that you should think so .	24547.62851333595
On their being joined by Bingley himself , Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas ;	173070.73793291705
Wickham passed all his youth there , you know .	87837.95697386864
As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , I shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females .	122379.5895605561
Very little was said by either ;	223418.7604267125
repeated Elizabeth , in utter amazement .	248348.92093465774
her liveliness had been never worse timed .	224994.7482576498
Perhaps it will be as well , if you discourage his coming here so very often .	66837.41983119886
CHAPTER V Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate .	112105.55016448081
She retreated from the window , fearful of being seen ;	159507.69417484812
he sustained it however with fortitude , and so far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into conversation with Gardiner .	72964.76127831268
She shared in their attendance on Bennet , and was a great comfort to them , in their hours of freedom .	146976.70004847145
Does he know his real character ?	244017.15524514113
In her kind schemes for Elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam .	112572.75974423096
We shall often meet , I hope , in Hertfordshire .	55031.43599814745
replied Kitty , it looks just like that man that used to be with him before .	194852.01371270424
If you were to give me forty such men , I never could be so happy as you .	68666.37962905079
She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious , made no other reply to Elizabeth's salutation , than a slight inclination of the head , and sat down without saying a word .	45936.48899496271
He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever , on the occasion .	41201.96283065796
What is to become of us !	33607.983414992115
It was kindly meant .	63249.50909744668
Lydia declared herself satisfied .	244558.93116281074
My sister , I am sure , will not hear of her removal .	92092.7766304695
The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities , though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings ;	101862.09572802206
If it was not for the entail I should not mind it .	30020.25179093409
And then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it .	68831.48219346275
They have some of the finest woods in the country .	48670.74556230666
Oh !	8965.45062507954
What did you say of me , that I did not deserve ?	110748.35786116162
You forget that I have made no answer .	73386.85773206051
Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility .	106622.30967284173
Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied , Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully .	67860.44697897913
I know not what to think .	14341.333792543048
Bennet could not give her consent , or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , though she talked to Bingley of nothing else , for half an hour ;	120975.95591882836
She knew not what to think , nor how to account for it .	57930.25076837681
So much the better .	824.3308410226997
You wanted me , I know , to say 'Yes , ' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste ;	148791.9753933141
It is admirable !	59120.82986402812
They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which I cannot wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects .	109834.99715347543
pride he probably had , and if not , it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town , where the family did not visit .	184510.7526837956
But , Lizzy , you can tell us whether it is like or not .	19245.814939745433
and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's dying an old maid .	95003.76480914313
The wisest and the best of men , nay , the wisest and best of their actions , may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke .	142222.9040949046
Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper ;	99025.04320011032
and it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning , and never said a word about it till now .	83549.20599687495
After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room , from the sideboard to the fender , to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London , Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden , which was large and well laid out , and to the cultivation of which he attended himself .	122893.21104334452
I should infinitely prefer a book .	81087.8934865868
but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless Darcy returned within the stated time .	108967.8809283371
This is not to be borne .	36165.49316708407
Had his first appearance , or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining , been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Darcy , the gardener's expression of surprise , on beholding his master , must immediately have told it .	123306.117167011
Hurst had therefore nothing to do , but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep .	169377.01639289063
I thought it would never be over ;	42150.617032309616
But if I do not take your likeness now , I may never have another opportunity .	66884.05732684927
Elizabeth made no answer , and walked on , her heart swelling with indignation .	10739.572576188255
And do you like her ?	31152.804997997217
It was an evening of no common delight to them all ;	51426.34850201192
I never can be thankful , Bennet , for any thing about the entail .	98755.45524991771
Were the same fair prospect to arise at present , as had flattered them a year ago , every thing , she was persuaded , would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion .	89601.00451628817
He danced only four dances !	179531.24753250286
I have not a doubt of Bingley's sincerity , said Elizabeth warmly ;	8098.098797959783
Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother , on his approaching marriage , were all that was affectionate and insincere .	110975.90670569359
Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort .	210482.10913787526
He likes to have his own way very well , replied Colonel Fitzwilliam .	156961.1616827752
It was painful , exceedingly painful , to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return .	101651.38765654582
Yes , thought Elizabeth , that would be a delightful scheme , indeed , and completely do for us at once .	103049.73957303238
but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off .	156378.38765314227
said he hastily , as he opened the door .	96727.68846343555
She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own , but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action , she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage .	93326.16494345502
As often as I can .	205173.87075548043
If you love Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham , you must be very happy .	64385.488744379734
She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas .	70769.13516697756
Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming , without changing colour .	64808.099626446805
1 .	10898.860396037358
You may depend on it , replied the other , for Nicholls was in Meryton last night ;	66779.59474130481
and she could hardly suppress a smile , at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had revolted , in his offer to herself .	87845.50980556218
I told Collins so before you came .	92278.58517928117
I knew , said he , that what I wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary .	71660.09074823189
Why did not you seek legal redress ?	16996.86189755926
When they repaired to the dining-room , Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place , which , in all their former parties , had belonged to him , by her sister .	87729.9541729772
It was necessary to laugh , when she would rather have cried .	29919.88271030709
Soon after you left me on Saturday , I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were .	117405.99208808017
but I always speak what I think .	42045.03213119658
And rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had not Collins thus addressed her , When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ;	140117.00789284296
But that is nothing to us .	36304.1005044577
Our distress , my dear Lizzy , is very great .	104209.09584773556
Not that I mean to find fault with you , for such things I know are all chance in this world .	71587.41305345466
I never saw such capacity , and taste , and application , and elegance , as you describe , united .	47104.43017379543
the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice .	176561.28461133392
found fault with the arrangement of the furniture , or detected the housemaid in negligence ;	228645.25867253327
How can you contrive to write so even ?	42311.41853466352
that my dear mother had more command over herself ;	191992.67473784424
The two first dances , however , brought a return of distress ;	101605.41687996246
The room in which the ladies sat was backwards .	163236.9761238632
My father's opinion of me does me the greatest honour ;	170638.54669824356
It may be easily believed , that however little of novelty could be added to their fears , hopes , and conjectures , on this interesting subject , by its repeated discussion , no other could detain them from it long , during the whole of the journey .	121047.21411235773
but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption !	106540.12854505563
The coach , therefore , took them the first stage of their journey , and brought its master back to Longbourn .	147772.7189648541
cried Jane , what do you mean , Sir ?	51206.52219904494
for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Darcy's steward , and of that , I can assure you , he informed me himself .	63881.306698607965
Her figure was elegant , and she walked well ;	176237.41905699254
I have faults enough , but they are not , I hope , of understanding .	17509.520014630572
but she could not approve him ;	36119.502474030705
and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so full of contradictions and varieties , sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance , and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination .	94241.95399131726
Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections ?	190197.95298977083
CHAPTER I It is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune , must be in want of a wife .	83505.46748899015
I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then Georgiana , unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me .	137215.888180191
It is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married , continued her mother , but at the same time , Bingley , it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me .	28454.20095419327
And in the first place , let us hear what has happened to you all , since you went away .	19533.27429513045
Besides , it will not much signify what one wears this summer , after the shire have left Meryton , and they are going in a fortnight .	119300.10243470153
His debts are to be paid , amounting , I believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her , and his commission purchased .	68352.01592736435
He dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday .	100263.27810828989
Her mother's ungraciousness , made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind ;	68768.20361783907
But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes .	120932.68522776963
You are rather disposed to call his interference officious ?	86304.58038261766
and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go , she did not seem to ask for compassion .	102147.95826058884
Whilst wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and Elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of Darcy approaching them , and at no great distance .	168566.717337586
At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here .	163180.9794641076
and it was but the other day , that I recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her .	33773.26695841342
We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side , said Jane : I hope and trust they will yet be happy .	53978.89598046102
that she had a new gown , or a new parasol , which she would have described more fully , but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry , as Forster called her , and they were going to the camp ;	122883.00007643983
If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement , I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one .	144838.34495309117
And pray may I ask ?	34186.1651627019
I should never be happy without him , so think it no harm to be off .	66846.05684982984
have you heard from my uncle ?	348225.77321067615
He repeated the question , with some surprise at her silence .	160409.77372134858
and a report soon followed that Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly .	113394.65578191134
for she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening , although utterly unknown to her before .	63881.306698607965
and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry her , had she been his relation .	90467.82681542379
As for your Elizabeth's picture , you must not attempt to have it taken , for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes ?	111586.36824599068
It would have suited me in every respect .	42208.745957837404
He immediately offered to fetch her others ;	170930.92547237704
I ought not to have said a word about it .	16721.766795493677
His father was an excellent man , said Gardiner .	107172.82874774389
One ought not to repine ;	232713.8839551545
I cannot catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as I often see done .	103653.3506097823
She was not sorry , however , to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung .	54068.42210729644
the other is Charlotte's marriage .	219993.2436218677
But you How are you ?	81944.41015039431
He danced only four dances , though gentlemen were scarce ;	162493.13136547894
Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ;	112670.65190185982
Good gracious !	4123.65795852664
I am more likely to want time than courage , Elizabeth .	83455.9493645878
And though he exclaimed at the term , she found that it had been pretty much the case .	154073.0819667834
and continually was she repeating , Why is he so altered ?	150117.88804207995
You may well warn me against such an evil .	22310.91817883142
They were of course all intending to be surprised ;	48914.06546951147
my head is always full of something else .	205580.16670045172
She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an inmate of Darcy's house , and mentioned with raptures , some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture .	118229.94623089048
This however was no evil to Elizabeth , and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough ;	159758.62901827702
He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before , on his reading Collins's letter ;	103547.16416334774
Jane , cried Elizabeth , was there a servant belonging to it , who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ?	116451.4257665086
They travelled as expeditiously as possible ;	185165.5234809513
You are a very strange creature by way of a friend !	52694.53607590154
When Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed , which certainly was not unseldom , she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte .	119323.27982014423
The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity ;	121371.94570918167
Your tempers are by no means unlike .	196241.15135600098
and , after receiving her answer , asked in an hesitating manner how long Darcy had been staying there .	69287.57491370375
His being so sure of succeeding , was wrong , said she ;	57561.65016439302
Allow me to say , Lady Catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application , have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged .	43690.607811103415
GARDINER .	702034.9987130143
and before he went away , an engagement was formed , chiefly through his own and Bennet's means , for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband .	119914.5235794789
you cannot go yourself .	276561.45293053985
That Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham , before his arrival , but without gaining any satisfactory information ;	158470.45638761067
They were in fact very fine ladies ;	42060.58169970637
Well , any friend of Bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure ;	52931.01535109885
Come , let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly .	113039.5569980033
I am , dear Sir , c .	42012.998937489785
or , as the happiest alternative , been secluded from the world , in some distant farm house .	112201.45260873096
And how impossible in others !	187503.82874024432
but of the truth of what I shall relate , I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity .	147906.81093764683
Nay , if you are so serious about it , I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled .	110195.68811216256
Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity , a warmth , a delight , which words could but poorly express .	168583.82768071519
At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ;	24093.48461156265
but from what the report of their engagement could originate , Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ;	112079.31531140272
my dear brother , replied Bennet , that is exactly what I could most wish for .	35482.037305613834
Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude , but said nothing .	15601.55201624699
it is very hard to think that she might have been Collins's wife by this time , had not it been for her own perverseness .	36103.68144838956
He could not speak a word for full ten minutes .	24979.428528349705
If this be the case , he deserves you .	174766.78505760297
His attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect ;	107172.82874774389
It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast ;	159867.88428390597
I am sure you will be very comfortable there .	21306.073885538648
At length the Parsonage was discernible .	38363.485645453264
so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as your's seems to have been .	180176.16964342256
I am afraid you will be angry .	7112.269761652264
He certainly looked at her friend a great deal , but the expression of that look was disputable .	151035.1314971678
She was less handsome than her brother , but there was sense and good humour in her face , and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle .	106259.50413252464
London : Printed for T Egerton , Military Library , Whitehall .	53.69533281330631
and she parted from him convinced , that whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing .	104021.79919558948
I often tell my other girls they are nothing to her .	54841.20083137799
Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction and a moment's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible , she sat down again , and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion .	101649.11844878281
I am not afraid of you , said he , smilingly .	6988.726304925085
I do not think it is very pretty ;	16809.957574273256
Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he ?	62472.04188539505
1 .	10898.860396037358
but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing , and between herself and Elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to .	79845.17827637497
MY DEAR NIECE , I have just received your letter , and shall devote this whole morning to answering it , as I foresee that a little writing will not comprise what I have to tell you .	121812.73678637651
and , though Kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense , since the disturbers of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended , was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance , by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp .	86949.22484478833
That is capital , added her sister , and they both laughed heartily .	95017.1070747644
Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer , as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces .	116462.61963674708
The girls grieved over such a number of ladies ;	107145.78229996747
said Elizabeth .	4797.661801655704
Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity , are not worth a regret .	167761.2919321632
It is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and interest , for him to be guilty of it .	50628.92869525038
What a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago , would now have been gladly and gratefully received !	115530.05663926253
and I understand from Gardiner , that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all , before she leaves the South .	103137.37759311707
said that she had liked him better when they met in Kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning .	113810.25332003646
We are speaking of music , Madam , said he , when no longer able to avoid a reply .	75005.49492407456
and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you .	58083.56424463676
They are descended on the maternal side , from the same noble line ;	98607.30000175345
And is this all ?	87000.81072872927
They have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression .	108532.04513025517
The boy protested that she should not ;	168958.79004850535
Bennet accepted the challenge , observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements .	157176.8438468609
They have at least that advantage .	93086.4305141264
It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge ;	64703.85748705571
My father began life in the profession which your uncle , Philips , appears to do so much credit to but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late Darcy , and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property .	96340.77580825542
That will not do for a compliment to Darcy , Caroline , cried her brother because he does not write with ease .	114561.48180027546
Adieu .	460112.61619632214
you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner .	215302.4994010512
but intricate characters are the most amusing .	167653.42428877368
grieved shocked .	568865.2538408812
This , she would not hear of ;	17910.990383323115
It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity ;	92426.98678873523
Hope was over , entirely over ;	348225.77321067615
F3 .	16070.241809748964
She longed to enquire of the housekeeper , whether her master were really absent , but had not courage for it .	72589.68641672835
Darcy was punctual in his return , and as Lydia informed you , attended the wedding .	105430.01858619346
It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's interested wishes , and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes , however openly or artfully spoken , could influence a young man so totally independent of every one .	110247.79436376123
I will speak to her about it myself directly .	87841.43461051847
Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley ;	49141.43590032001
and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand .	106388.2463573366
The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new , yet I think it is well expressed .	70395.81783402627
The supposition did not pain her .	172636.33074470388
Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense .	152433.9174649549
The latter was thinking only of his breakfast .	45547.460609602575
Their father then went to the library to write , and the girls walked into the breakfast-room .	166010.61316552493
and then , what do you think we did ?	21717.97884094496
he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it ;	99692.12612796579
and , after a pause of several minutes , was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion , who , in a manner , which though it spoke compassion , spoke likewise restraint , said , I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing , concern .	93685.94909859165
and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added , I have never had a cross word from him in my life , and I have known him ever since he was four years old .	63336.15096526891
Wherever you and Jane are known , you must be respected and valued ;	242551.5891690185
but Darcy can please where he chuses .	103944.84000314363
Only think of that my dear ;	38414.16162721071
and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room , its aspect and its furniture , he addressed himself particularly to her , as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him .	60230.317982021275
They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends , and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family , when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window , and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle , driving up the street .	83224.71870160755
But it ought to be done , and if you will give me a sheet of paper , it shall be done directly .	71733.83272421556
The least agreeable circumstance in the business , was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet , whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person .	101862.09572802206
And that , said Reynolds , pointing to another of the miniatures , is my master and very like him .	111649.29574370182
I should not be surprised , said Darcy , if he were to give it up , as soon as any eligible purchase offers .	79898.62284526494
I thought him very sly ;	83907.15959437874
When is your turn to come ?	195598.14497953426
'Lady Catherine , ' said she , 'you have given me a treasure .	242551.5891690185
I shall never forget her appearance this morning .	85091.40827848147
But no , recollecting herself , that could never be : my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me : I should not have been allowed to invite them .	87620.21913287975
We passed each other several times .	195910.8677617386
When they all removed to Brighton , therefore , you had no reason , I suppose , to believe them fond of each other .	55478.28010866207
Her reflections were in general satisfactory .	189990.40807227822
The officers will find women better worth their notice .	102307.25062353733
E2 .	702034.9987130143
Let us sit down .	87122.88613315817
With your good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others !	165005.08823021728
While Sir William was with them , Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig , and shewing him the country ;	161802.8645560357
she felt all the compliment it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother .	73630.23251655464
You have sense , and we all expect you to use it .	94703.83338402546
Their other engagements were few ;	99835.97002280988
Change of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home , may be as useful as anything .	201850.22994999238
Oh yes !	229640.0101174344
I often think , said she , that there is nothing so bad as parting with one's friends .	81253.13998332
Mary had neither genius nor taste ;	102236.35763177725
1813 .	15895.509420740158
You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner in such society ;	100776.11748641834
and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character , in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of Elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end .	95993.87135770824
Elizabeth , for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts , now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since her coming away .	78951.95583817805
repeated Bennet .	342619.010840163
but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment , had they sat in one equally lively ;	113029.09115861189
Oh !	8965.45062507954
She paused , and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse .	144268.91897459762
And to be kept back on such a motive !	107154.78999613937
