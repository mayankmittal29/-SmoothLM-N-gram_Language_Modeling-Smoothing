Average perplexity: 66.910471756763
I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner .	49.90971346208487
and to him she had hardly courage to speak .	58.09179406081631
At that ball , while I had the honour of dancing with you , I was first made acquainted , by Sir William Lucas's accidental information , that Bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage .	24.49057870804361
My aunt Philips came to Longbourn on Tuesday , after my father went away ;	42.8996123004817
Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Robinson ;	55.09505005628496
I should take him , even on my slight acquaintance , to be an ill-tempered man .	32.102703764396345
The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret .	34.126631830299935
That is all very proper and civil , I am sure , said Bennet , and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman .	22.978156106118245
When I went away , I felt that it would soon happen .	43.484270704594906
and she felt capable under such circumstances , of endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters .	34.306624636394595
But that is not the case here .	90.92883435259978
Such I was , from eight to eight and twenty ;	92.96812591114339
and so extremely accomplished for her age !	64.09111515435563
or at least it was impossible not to try for information .	64.44468600757473
Nor I , I am sure , said Miss Bingley .	54.64280926630397
The day passed most pleasantly away ;	66.80998427071887
There has been many a one , I fancy , overcome in the same way .	40.957637393271455
It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week .	35.66544759644261
for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know , and read great books , and make extracts .	31.668426496125985
and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon , was such an instance of Lady Catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough .	25.84423055372737
She was quite amazed at her own discomposure ;	49.77873996239604
How abominable !	302.42349845091735
After a few minutes reflection , however , she continued , I do remember his boasting one day , at Netherfield , of the implacability of his resentments , of his having an unforgiving temper .	18.25882804878544
Elizabeth again , and more seriously assured her of its truth .	47.54979757966134
and the effort which the formation , and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read .	23.059065219819136
these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce ;	26.155161210766064
and I have enquired of every body too , who is likely to know .	35.476985801001625
Here was knowledge in which no one could partake ;	73.31443460975791
C below .	284.22119945198097
The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents , about a twelvemonth ago , was now brought forward again .	25.418591162819403
but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine .	45.09848182374866
Since her being at Lambton , she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud ;	50.49507352588012
and oh !	115.11488052819446
Did you see it ?	184.12625740488107
I must be in town next Saturday .	58.479974090523655
A lady's imagination is very rapid ;	76.08945220270722
They stood for some time without speaking a word ;	64.82925001394565
The morrow produced no abatement of Bennet's ill humour or ill health .	30.788017459456082
He had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them ;	33.28385702942549
She told the story however with great spirit among her friends ;	50.07114747951515
How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter !	62.577817433182226
If I had known as much this morning , I certainly would not have called on him .	41.71785351922484
The old lady is Jenkinson , who lives with them .	42.08971997842687
At least , therefore , I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies .	24.513225139503835
Bennet , in equal silence , was enjoying the scene .	53.38696389680532
That his two sisters and Darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough , and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable .	19.40771882274385
I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous elopement .	27.409369177457986
and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and forwarded , as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side .	26.425328207569216
and the beautiful pyramids of grapes , nectarines , and peaches , soon collected them round the table .	18.954499062672795
Transcriber's note : Spelling and hyphen changes have been made so that there is consistency within the book .	20.595839250466295
But I must tell you how it went off .	52.66600632558952
He bore it however with admirable calmness .	55.15836736781475
To be sure , you knew no actual good of me but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love .	36.17168809711629
Why should they try to influence him ?	75.3617481451445
His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others , as in his reproaches to myself .	23.281337289985384
and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own , it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance .	18.727181571425994
Elizabeth was not surprised at it , as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill .	36.51592068374841
that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation , than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance .	23.460247402760196
You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas .	55.819885258129204
People do not die of little trifling colds .	45.9969385743523
With all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it , am I wrong , my dearest Jane , in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many ?	28.10009693718117
And then we were so merry all the way home !	59.73528540156023
Indeed , Mama , you are mistaken , said Elizabeth , blushing for her mother .	28.28418267445718
I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat .	29.302479877789253
and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley .	24.464641726356877
No , indeed , I did not .	53.00692006287295
Darcy's letter , she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart .	45.669145262813565
I cannot think so very ill of Wickham .	61.41843921085757
he actually danced with her twice ;	101.55081635782862
and Jane more especially , who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself , had she been the culprit , was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure .	26.923959926828783
said Lydia stoutly , I am not afraid ;	76.32137559098773
and Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages .	26.519136960787723
Lizzy , why am I thus singled from my family , and blessed above them all !	32.89801358734906
though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present , because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character .	18.277344911125795
The idea of Collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther , and he continued : My reasons for marrying are , first , that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances ( like myself ) to set the example of matrimony in his parish .	18.804093384201796
Upon my word !	203.23335136165338
and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , she could , perhaps , believe , that remaining partiality for her , might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned .	21.439063325105554
Her favourite walk , and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine , was along the open grove which edged that side of the park , where there was a nice sheltered path , which no one seemed to value but herself , and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity .	15.425766628168518
I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear .	25.464160264681244
And what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail ?	38.74921659674832
Widely different was the effect of a second perusal .	62.248411814151225
We will know where we have gone we will recollect what we have seen .	50.70966791775097
Her fellow-travellers the next day , were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable .	37.37381322795567
And then when we came away it was such fun !	58.44672285056803
or rather he has not Wickham's countenance , for his features are perfectly good .	53.23106367410603
How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence , she could not imagine .	35.071624470115935
for at any rate , there seemed a gulf impassable between them .	35.43587112487102
and she told me that it was certain true .	51.995225853985524
His regard for her was quite imaginary ;	91.17092987596278
and for the last half year , nay , for a twelvemonth , she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity .	26.59039389088337
Her astonishment , however , was extreme ;	69.4379904350379
This is the estimation in which you hold me !	60.13071434250058
when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them , and Elizabeth , looking earnestly in her face , was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever .	23.26689784134249
In short , my dear aunt , I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy ;	28.67337585564005

What will become of me .	104.65387630729306
But do you always write such charming long letters to her , Darcy ?	45.05231422929314
But how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable ?	54.50830145610942
but checking himself , he added in a gayer tone , Is it in address that he improves ?	24.358559404250602
Professor Michael S Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone .	16.58725610691229
This account then is what he has received from Darcy .	71.80735163897039
They were interrupted by Miss Bennet , who came to fetch her mother's tea .	31.02540405130901
and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity .	34.36466667822948
she is not acting by design .	98.39348156949342
Jane was not happy .	152.68129815938204
Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers , and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed , or a really new muslin in a shop window , could recal them .	17.498323013533405
it gives such an elegance to misfortune !	78.44157027513657
Other schemes too came into her head .	76.30273948887493
I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister .	31.16677647243303
If I were as rich as Darcy , cried a young Lucas who came with his sisters , I should not care how proud I was .	35.74180471157862
I shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier .	39.70533348106791
though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm , at her lively , sportive , manner of talking to her brother .	29.248047771275424
1 .	384.9991185797929
Yes , madam , said Bennet , delighted to speak to a lady Catherine .	33.91347191598015
Pray , what is your age ?	144.30263569989935
And one of my own daughters .	87.83519751056069

I have been most highly gratified indeed , my dear Such very superior dancing is not often seen .	26.44619175755085
If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of , the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time , for from the day of the invitation , to the day of the ball , there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once .	20.19198714347379
To this , Mary very gravely replied , Far be it from me , my dear sister , to depreciate such pleasures .	24.408443915971265
In the evening , soon after Bennet withdrew to the library , she saw Darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme .	22.295199542473988
She saw instantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage ;	37.87741270128744
Her answer was warmly in his favour .	87.23822268524916
Darcy made no answer , and seemed desirous of changing the subject .	34.22960308334984
How are they even to be discovered ?	92.3121233223494
She enquired after his sister , but could do no more .	52.50196509101587
she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined in company with him four times .	34.65954282376266
Are you much acquainted with Darcy ?	87.84211477025117
We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton .	40.359021707645866
My object then , replied Darcy , was to shew you , by every civility in my power , that I was not so mean as to resent the past ;	32.059120961766446
How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains !	51.24123331672438
I mean , that no man in his senses , would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a-year during my life , and fifty after I am gone .	23.21784722943004
You must not suspect me .	80.99064695906166
Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred , during their visit , as they returned , except what had particularly interested them both .	38.72592720982606
Who would have thought it !	118.52509503519587
I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment .	28.215084529094355
Our plain manner of living , our small rooms , and few domestics , and the little we see of the world , must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself ;	22.85660362717712
You dare not , you cannot deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of dividing them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind .	18.368570221155643
When they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ;	21.54462126085587
Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow .	66.41158544120924
In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion , with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode , and the improvements it was receiving , he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them ;	14.393626157172989
I will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away , and come back again .	22.918960631056734
Well , Lizzy , said Bennet one day , what is your opinion now of this sad business of Jane's ?	33.98069501573651
But I hope you will not mind it : it is all for Jane's sake , you know ;	33.50693034134193
and it is that which makes the wonder .	58.03410832331689
She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought ;	26.890785907321987
Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment , nor were the other ladies often absent ;	37.559838458432516
Darcy danced only once with Hurst and once with Miss Bingley , declined being introduced to any other lady , and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room , speaking occasionally to one of his own party .	18.798345183457183
and though his pride was hurt , he suffered in no other way .	45.43033681443367
The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master , who was coming down in a day or two , to shoot there for several weeks .	23.957004093249793
There is a lady , it seems , a Younge , who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what .	22.266244982489734
He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her ;	20.643875798747573
He had not been long seated before he complimented Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters , said he had heard much of their beauty , but that , in this instance , fame had fallen short of the truth ;	24.376115143687244
Miss Bingley was engrossed by Darcy , her sister scarcely less so ;	43.53238604337645
They will have nothing else to do .	89.65614898032278
In point of composition , said Mary , his letter does not seem defective .	35.74339856923495
he was lively and unreserved , danced every dance , was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield .	28.681123420269138
it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her .	34.10789553480237
That is his notion of christian forgiveness !	41.089878795414684
what hours of transport we shall spend !	68.69973807579862
Oh !	298.0706733468098
so much ease , with such perfect good breeding !	72.62745254271655
Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness .	34.04710507318753
It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night .	37.38920888687848
I cannot quite agree with you there .	65.24510563901197
it is just as he chooses .	82.35954585290187
I am not romantic you know .	46.6280658609934
Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed , a mixture of pride and impertinence ;	32.42378164884776
She was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself ;	47.40817900206245
But there are two things that I want very much to know : one is , how much money your uncle has laid down , to bring it about ;	34.47145823897606
but that is what a governess will prevent , and if I had known your mother , I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one .	27.34211427852792
There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention , while she added , When I said that he improved on acquaintance , I did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement , but that from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood .	21.297183445044872
Colonel Forster is a sensible man , and will keep her out of any real mischief ;	31.38678094183983
The reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as I have given above .	39.26886685321858
Both changed colour , one looked white , the other red .	57.69003330997945
It had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town ;	33.046856040464604
but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended ;	39.67446328233306
Darcy !	659.7571091073834
Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far ;	95.28013646014435
though it had not occurred to me before .	87.2602896907009
to own the truth , with Wickham !	158.9923896350033
Her hopes were answered ;	151.58195102691957
He was my godfather , and excessively attached to me .	35.54211224392305
Well , well , said he , do not make yourself unhappy .	40.46562982602189
This is quite shocking !	131.4299251707239
How hard it is in some cases to be believed !	61.99599459844646
and he was always the sweetest-tempered , most generous-hearted , boy in the world .	26.47687266291424
and after observing Collins for a few moments , he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh .	20.342629052180442

and depend upon it , you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this , as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire .	25.287383584986863
it must be so , while he retains the use of his reason .	41.972985469747414
Vain , ignorant , idle , and absolutely uncontrouled !	40.060317817300025
but Jane happened to look round , and happened to smile : it was decided .	28.742668824161395
And is it really true ?	136.88143594310264
The letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so .	33.523193103668525
Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters .	32.38276607819151
Collins !	845.7732629471502
Without a governess you must have been neglected .	62.859628083433236
Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening , but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine , and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time .	22.556415469965362

for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her .	28.988624883767947
after honestly telling her what she thought , she thus went on : You are too sensible a girl , Lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are warned against it ;	24.04376361927568
And so , Darcy did every thing ;	90.93077532336899

said he , smiling .	156.78604574649884
Gardiner did not write again , till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster ;	39.86078986488489
But before they heard again from Gardiner , a letter arrived for their father , from a different quarter , from Collins ;	40.911427278570294
how acutely did she now feel it .	84.2432494051656
cried Jane .	419.0086819812439
I never heard any thing so abominable .	54.278142961290996
It was at Sir William Lucas's , where a large party were assembled .	36.23212794252267
but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield , and leave the next generation to purchase .	17.907067402801772
Her father had most cruelly mortified her , by what he said of Darcy's indifference , and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that perhaps , instead of his seeing too little , she might have fancied too much .	18.98127274508999
and though feeling no reliance on her , could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved .	26.467031682992083
Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Bingley's name had been last mentioned between them ;	32.19074751285753
CHAPTER XVI .	234.75576465601785
Did you go by the village of Kympton ?	53.27765589710001
Bennet's expectations were fully answered .	105.72866060980135
Will you come and see me ?	127.37044659206333
1 .	384.9991185797929
As she pronounced these words , Darcy changed colour ;	54.80781327753873
They all paint tables , cover skreens and net purses .	19.98650406435156
But now we may be silent .	70.58258178244103
After a short silence , the lady first spoke .	73.55061337154866
But here , by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister's absence , I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized .	22.865517827862533
Elizabeth obeyed , and running into her own room for her parasol , attended her noble guest down stairs .	21.399944966748436
For about three years I heard little of him ;	89.93256385684508
Has your governess left you ?	134.81993513258374
but I was over-ruled , as I always am .	57.76381721279055
The family were assembled in the breakfast room , to receive them .	35.946814589277416
and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion .	43.50114407445105
Unless the elder brother is very sickly , I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds .	30.332104198160344
If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him ;	24.469807783516455
but so we all were .	134.30285015606125
Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew , but he had never seen any thing but affability in her .	26.177225731898755
Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had , from the distress of the moment , been led to make Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister ;	23.13683121095131
Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter , that Charlotte , really rejoicing in the match , was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over .	16.794588948063282
You are to understand , Miss Bennet , that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose ;	26.735282237357
She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs .	38.36710907621504
The farewell between herself and Wickham was perfectly friendly ;	59.91676491714866
I wonder , said he , at the next opportunity of speaking , whether he is likely to be in this country much longer .	26.791135411332924
She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance , Hurst and Miss Bingley .	29.643993144486174
And , if I may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your lady possesses .	23.189780539760164
it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours , which the discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable ;	32.07781564866329
Let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers .	29.664967197977816
In comparing her recollection of Pemberley , with the minute description which Wickham could give , and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor , she was delighting both him and herself .	17.961828935424727
He was growing quite inattentive to other people , and wholly engrossed by her .	25.220378374673157
I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Darcy .	34.48004935855024
She had better have stayed at home , cried Elizabeth ;	39.726570453966204
On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn , your uncle had a most unexpected visitor .	41.73836806698747
and , turning to Elizabeth , said , Miss Eliza Bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room .	23.11126362573954
It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both ;	40.27530621001384
Yes ;	506.5076850786652
The favour of your company has been much felt , I assure you .	35.714760572205485
We have heard nothing from town .	102.71835593907738
Really , Collins , cried Elizabeth with some warmth , you puzzle me exceedingly .	41.01877478472518
They are gone down to Newcastle , a place quite northward , it seems , and there they are to stay , I do not know how long .	29.71893631147513
Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather , which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Wickham ;	23.804019681945764
and , in short , as the time drew near , she would have been very sorry for any delay .	31.685394273273324
But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation , she made no answer .	36.52749690587703
Perhaps we might be deceived .	150.21158566360626
the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father ;	29.73014924166915
Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there , that day ;	39.348822628388746
E9 .	531.6294007955007
One seems so forlorn without them .	80.43335958285607
I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever .	37.243823244301886
You need not send them word at Longbourn of my going , if you do not like it , for it will make the surprise the greater , when I write to them , and sign my name Lydia Wickham .	24.13936721023161
but he never distinguished her by any particular attention , and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourites .	19.359695933507922
Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure , and she was eagerly calling out , while her daughter read , Well , Jane , who is it from ?	31.108700317721592
I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more .	41.33331391445674
His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling .	89.5919410431875
but now as the first shock is over , shall I own that I long for your return ?	44.84165580294042
My faults , according to this calculation , are heavy indeed !	40.884625018617434
You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for resisting every repetition of it .	22.522773790537734
She practises very constantly .	75.84201771214268
She had very little notice from any but him .	55.69676979882842
In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley , whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose .	28.40972003011834
but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at Hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of and Collins's happiness ;	18.820596577606366
Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all ;	53.3134758912148
Upon the whole , I am much pleased with him .	57.17760357112507
Collins , you must send a servant with them .	67.97680791599792
It is a grievous affair to my poor girls , you must confess .	37.886180867064134
and when the carriage drove up to the door , the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces , and displayed itself over their whole bodies , in a variety of capers and frisks , was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome .	15.77089322741763
It was impossible to imagine ;	85.81155847105343
That is very true , replied Elizabeth , and I could easily forgive his pride , if he had not mortified mine .	22.960304370047783
The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial , and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded , as having passed at the Netherfield ball , and as confirming all his first disapprobation , could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers .	18.056440496528683
If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room , I shall be very thankful ;	24.917818532070104
But in all , and in almost every line of each , there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style , and which , proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself , and kindly disposed towards every one , had been scarcely ever clouded .	16.30541364465812
I saw them the night before last .	76.03169992995291
With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes , did Lydia , assisted by Kitty's hints and additions , endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn .	17.86020136995773
Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ?	53.515996883528366
I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women .	33.10207854091825
She would be in nobody's way , you know , in that part of the house .	31.68368996589318
Oh !	298.0706733468098
and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother , and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance , particularly grateful to the daughter .	16.59332315473976
the turning past , he was immediately before them .	71.70365847814574
They had frequently been staying with her in town .	64.91704931492825
They will take care not to outrun their income .	47.42563050350669
These two girls had been above an hour in the place , happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner , watching the sentinel on guard , and dressing a sallad and cucumber .	13.754580507887098
How you must have hated me after that evening ?	64.75912328033816
She is all affability and condescension , and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over .	22.37182547055828
If she heard me , it was by good luck , for I am sure she did not listen .	35.45886371013425
He smiled , looked handsome , and said many pretty things .	40.82751968791496
The very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour , and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of .	22.48283951370829
By this time she is actually with them !	100.68243550376583
Not these two or three years perhaps .	91.64090233683906
and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable .	23.662453675949358
It amazes me , I confess ;	66.05400902056756
Miss Bennet , do you know who I am ?	63.739022202671336
As they walked home , Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen ;	41.21230164102342
Its business office is located at 8<DATE> West , Salt Lake City , UT 84116 , ( 801 ) 596-1887 .	12.141157487953523
and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably , when the sound of horses drew their notice , and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street .	21.227361645153177
Supposing him to be attached to me , would my refusing to accept his hand , make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ?	31.77704037484451
That had his actions been what Wickham represented them , so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world ;	24.9180189939726
Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent ;	40.978252214835585
Dining out , said Bennet , that is very unlucky .	59.5113990503646
Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a depravity , to which the separation of two young persons , whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison .	20.185713935600923
Charlotte tried to console her .	122.95935269067803
one meets it every where .	160.21041499947154
they are even impartial towards Miss King .	78.73658996460492
You shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very dreadful .	45.349953790716555
It may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement .	21.701689794888654
After lamenting it however at some length , she had the consolation of thinking that Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn , and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that , though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses .	21.87239685600748
For my part , I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody .	49.3866458624211
Mary , however , continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them .	25.514802697722242
I am always glad to get a young person well placed out .	32.90385781567579
She shook her head .	83.68899153271278
The park was very large , and contained great variety of ground .	31.834632143790397
what could she mean by it ?	168.18785049874643
Darcy may hug himself .	114.80402199884668
The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her .	48.519373571475434
and I am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not .	25.941461943704994
It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing , said Bingley .	40.99341472591806
Most willingly .	324.0537387280951
But do not imagine that he is always here so often .	47.11477542569906
If you were sensible of your own good , you would not wish to quit the sphere , in which you have been brought up .	28.307483862380117
When I consider , she added , in a yet more agitated voice , that I might have prevented it !	31.630995040933676
The little Gardiners , attracted by the sight of a chaise , were standing on the steps of the house , as they entered the paddock ;	20.494987638049512
It keeps him in good humour , said she , and I am more obliged to you than I can express .	25.36276126819702
Say that urgent business calls us home immediately .	50.24364078444316
every body says that he is ate up with pride , and I dare say he had heard somehow that Long does not keep a carriage , and had come to the ball in a hack chaise .	18.527376126421263
But they did pass away , and and Gardiner , with their four children , did at length appear at Longbourn .	32.060920794647664
He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention .	34.0479751329248
Let me mend it for you .	88.6362742077564
Her heart had been but slightly touched , and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice , had fortune permitted it .	21.5887634754166
I do think Long is as good a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls , and not at all handsome : I like them prodigiously .	27.58379296550678
On his quitting the room , she sat down , unable to support herself , and looking so miserably ill , that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her , or to refrain from saying , in a tone of gentleness and commiseration , Let me call your maid .	15.915289680438535
1813 .	662.9770795749859
Upon this signal , the youngest of her daughters put herself forward .	56.054158556027666
Bennet had many grievances to relate , and much to complain of .	46.04357110206154
You take delight in vexing me .	56.71907679270173
For my part , Bingley , I always keep servants that can do their own work ;	46.68552528973471
Darcy , you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner .	39.235485735836214
He owed a good deal in the town , but his debts of honour were still more formidable .	33.46690181360961
Darcy's shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict , gave her a keener sense of her sister's sufferings .	22.18782436476168
They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her , and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her , So , Miss Eliza , I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham !	18.01748907766922
yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week .	56.38629681037358
I must have employment and society .	59.28851117692339
It would be nothing ;	129.48932523482776
and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room .	45.632950325513264
I should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me .	36.30411653393288
No , no , you shall not deceive me .	66.12020417872539
that to be in the same room , the same party with him for so many hours together , might be more than I could bear , and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself .	26.738935141544093
And then , said she , if that very improbable event should ever take place , I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself .	26.79692923485079
Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment ;	70.57275662943894
After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour , without hearing Miss Bingley's voice , Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family .	25.203205799889815
it had been written five days ago .	73.34537208963049
I do not know the particulars , but I know very well that Darcy is not in the least to blame , that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned , and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way .	18.974552162938476
Yes , very handsome .	153.48820317716135
my uncle !	608.9197711815694
But in such cases as these , a good memory is unpardonable .	50.25295544030265
Darcy !	659.7571091073834
Collins made his declaration in form .	94.63197521663899
Lady Catherine rose also , and they turned back .	45.98115209987568
My good opinion once lost is lost for ever .	57.08771798585397
Send back your answer as soon as you can , and be careful to write explicitly .	38.288385175683416
The feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation .	26.17644905510796
They found Mary , as usual , deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature ;	21.258591858052984
CHAPTER XXI .	249.51422743723455
Their table was superlatively stupid .	88.08658604589404
Jane now came up .	189.92779362372283
She then took a large house in Edward-street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings .	27.765662678030093
CHAPTER XIX .	223.11563766813362
and now , my dear Jane , what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business ?	24.231928347300986
And what arts did he use to separate them ?	52.99910913422178
Mary and Kitty have been very kind , and would have shared in every fatigue , I am sure , but I did not think it right for either of them .	23.032423252032423
cried Elizabeth , with the greatest satisfaction .	75.64230423968574
Again his astonishment was obvious ;	91.54107115900644
Why did not you all learn ?	115.30600405541483
Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy , though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Bingley's regard , and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it .	23.160420690466715
He was then , he said , on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her .	38.550845328022916
It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single .	52.88638609564925
At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies , by not asking them to dance , and I spoke to him twice myself , without receiving an answer .	27.515081516835007
Your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man I know ;	52.79217314284273
As it was certain , however , that somebody was coming , Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion , and walk away with him into the shrubbery .	21.29636568083101
There can be no doubt of that .	92.91031960820617
and besides all this , she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking , the tone of her voice , her address and expressions , or the word will be but half deserved .	24.258475823021353
Good bye .	294.4259161294515
Bingley arrived .	408.24307385006784
Yes that is what makes it amusing .	89.06469937274986
yes ;	915.3805443967848
I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me ;	41.275791664076245
and from her correspondence with her sister , there was still less to be learnt for her letters to Kitty , though rather longer , were much too full of lines under the words to be made public .	21.900258735670082
but the latter half , which was dated a day later , and written in evident agitation , gave more important intelligence .	29.152097860833752
He knows where we live .	99.5860908195116
and , among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army .	24.58672191830968
In truth I must acknowledge that , with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage , I should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion , while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings .	24.09373108126472
You do not blame me , however , for refusing him ?	36.91359693421773
for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion , I should at present detest his very name , and wish him all manner of evil .	24.565029252203455
and from the observation of the day altogether , she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented .	24.215369433961268
I do not wish to avoid the walk .	45.40781184459311
What pin-money , what jewels , what carriages you will have !	55.21653739710679
Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl , and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose .	30.39019044829794
She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Forster , and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton , where the temptations must be greater than at home .	17.94353635088976
but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others , and she had no opportunity of detaining them .	22.24988976338308
All Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away ;	61.44145503833797
I described , and enforced them earnestly .	36.913319263447306
for , of course , they were to have a son .	76.89427559190668
But is it certain , absolutely certain ?	75.38979107119818
Mr .	662.9770795749859
CHAPTER XVII .	223.11563766813362
She was not equal , however , to much conversation , and when Miss Bingley left them together , could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with .	19.15549168855513
so I will dictate , and you write for me .	70.13736025177661
The surprise of such an application was great indeed ;	60.035842590617705
but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much .	31.324196587053564
He has been accused of many faults at different times ;	38.113892776802416
Have you had any flirting ?	114.68238264198467
and luckily for the others , the business of love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company .	23.52215117798294
What shall we do with him ?	127.59609236636564
First , that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion ;	41.49363716781138
and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , I hope , acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Wickham .	19.997061072439525
For your sake , turning to Charlotte , I am glad of it ;	43.956740408754655
Design !	662.9770795749859
She is a very good kind of girl , I believe .	44.86341198237868
Every savage can dance .	121.48659086831489
At length , every idea seemed to fail him ;	54.611108311573645
Oh !	298.0706733468098
END OF VOL .	118.89906341037893
F5 .	662.9770795749859
I have heard , indeed , that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two .	28.94781182922781
I will only say farther , that from what passed that evening , my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me before , to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection .	24.332048085989676
Catherine , weak-spirited , irritable , and completely under Lydia's guidance , had been always affronted by their advice ;	25.269187007766984
The moral will be perfectly fair .	58.496140170957865
and she lay awake two whole hours , endeavouring to make them out .	28.517426569355607
F3 , this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' , WITH NO OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND , EXPRESS OR IMPLIED , INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE .	7.190685506536544
Let me advise you then , my dear Sir , to console yourself as much as possible , to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever , and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence .	17.78637842142144
how would she have behaved ?	189.9975726199821
There , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard .	28.097518759606697
She could think of nothing but of Wickham , and of what he had told her , all the way home ;	34.736571936857636
There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley , that could provoke his ridicule , or disgust him into silence ;	26.577211794863473
and the possibility of her deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret .	27.531479394309958
Her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely recollected her interest in the affair , and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth , seemed to have fixed them on her more , and more cheerfully .	22.864403821626944
It does not necessarily follow that a deep , intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours .	20.856779885099538
His sense of her inferiority of its being a degradation of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination , were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding , but was very unlikely to recommend his suit .	19.077098276696887
and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged , as by no means unpleasing , though it could not be exactly defined .	25.191159405411295
or at least , by the predominance of virtue , atone for those casual errors , under which she would endeavour to class , what Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance .	17.541607364472917
Colonel Fitzwilliam , who led the way , was about thirty , not handsome , but in person and address most truly the gentleman .	36.21399837872264
and till the morrow , their going was deferred .	47.96550012087293
Anxious and uneasy , the period which passed in the drawing-room , before the gentlemen came , was wearisome and dull to a degree , that almost made her uncivil .	27.719749125199684
I have nothing to say against him ;	59.37858845274506
She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged .	33.37328267188279
Gardiner was surprised and concerned ;	158.12672255917215
They are my old friends .	90.57274695373631
And that I suppose is one of your sisters .	66.17157613916008
My mother means well ;	145.76381714781465
I shall like it of all things .	75.76678309822752
I do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to .	20.61445697213381
Have a little compassion on my nerves .	82.44872040325826
And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman , Ma'am ?	53.251923961803655
It was not all settled before Monday : as soon as it was , the express was sent off to Longbourn .	32.17084357551009
Their manners are not equal to his .	95.0583274986406
His behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire .	44.330446611606014
CHAPTER IV .	223.11563766813362
It is done , however , and it was done for the best .	33.963250267924906
and all that I can hope in this case is , that she is deceived herself .	38.4025045143759
and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate .	49.02950582661317
and with a more smiling solemnity replied , It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably .	26.92816803975143
But Jane could think with certainty on only one point , that Bingley , if he had been imposed on , would have much to suffer when the affair became public .	24.855604816426595
She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind .	29.464665776092122
It is a nice long walk , and Darcy has never seen the view .	39.51326233484036
our authority was too good .	180.30996705596928
Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the good will of Hurst and Miss Bingley ;	41.46418053933758
He has many friends , and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing .	33.64261833575687
She talked on , therefore , without interruption from any of them till they were joined by Collins , who entered with an air more stately than usual , and on perceiving whom , she said to the girls , Now , I do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your tongues , and let Collins and me have a little conversation together .	19.59167377678981
that was impossible ;	398.88155266713625
It cannot be concealed from any one .	57.042892119216575
Denny addressed them directly , and entreated permission to introduce his friend , Wickham , who had returned with him the day before from town , and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps .	24.085806849974336
but perhaps you would like to read it .	69.22587580947928
Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance .	67.77003688985658
Oh !	298.0706733468098
said Jane faintly smiling , You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , I could not hesitate .	25.87723262863072
They were soon gone again , rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise , and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Bennet's civilities .	21.235176620838523
She held out her hand ;	81.98753766962052
the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door , and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual .	26.933874892484134
Bennet protested against any description of finery .	56.20220111761927
and pride has often been his best friend .	62.883109962991675
Elizabeth related to Jane the next day , what had passed between Wickham and herself .	42.75824005051051
When the tea-things were removed , and the card tables placed , the ladies all rose , and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him , when all her views were overthrown , by seeing him fall a victim to her mother's rapacity for whist players , and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party .	15.774732100856655
They were to be off as soon as possible .	46.743095973404145
I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life .	34.89091438207016
Others of the party were now applied to .	74.98181149332747
I will leave him to himself .	69.82190617025715
How good it was in you , my dear Bennet !	65.88349291693271
in half a minute the letter was unfolded again , and collecting herself as well as she could , she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham , and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence .	19.657195361815187
When the engagement was for home , some of the officers always made part of it , of which officers Wickham was sure to be one ;	32.61363981328021
till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante .	38.44817080095627
E6 .	662.9770795749859
Bennet invited him to dine with them ;	77.0486276975445
You need not distress yourself .	72.09354018602843
and he was more communicative , and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him .	31.020882108503493
What do you mean , Bennet , by talking in this way ?	58.79641331202663
A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features , but he said not a word , and Elizabeth , though blaming herself for her own weakness , could not go on .	22.233867276461407
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement , the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law .	13.873824959715279
In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name ;	52.814766083392456
Elizabeth took up some needlework , and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion .	30.696672793511645
His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive ;	63.7946382488484
With great energy ;	226.18321810538006
there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day .	42.8046276820449
Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ;	40.135284825060374
She is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and I have no opinion of her .	25.388566083471773
Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit , and threw back the praise on her sister's warm affection .	25.21437529579279
My visit was not long , as Caroline and Hurst were going out .	53.0709689594935
They will never be distressed for money .	74.05738513114923
for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial .	33.923124584803304
True .	653.8562846757216
your feelings , I know , will bestow it unwillingly , but I demand it of your justice .	41.94145040780503
I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one ;	34.61436590927748
My dear Jane , Collins is a conceited , pompous , narrow-minded , silly man ;	25.866502759986673
If he does not come to me , then , said she , I shall give him up for ever .	31.69029251492019
I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his ill-treatment ;	24.086034112018034
Well , now let us be quite comfortable and snug , and talk and laugh all the way home .	29.410774661801387
and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world .	22.82881694575044

Sir William had been delighted with him .	51.77643604548149
and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair .	39.11720911989968
said Gardiner .	543.2129565977247
The business was therefore soon settled .	94.69635522389393
and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated , I felt no doubt of their happiness together .	29.040083815294032
and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings .	57.963905808157485
but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention .	36.33748818750938
She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there , and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you .	22.30488081807815
that I had been with you , you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone .	46.57246889389925
but , with many expressions of concern , he confessed himself engaged elsewhere .	37.15119611207554
Wickham had received his commission before he left London , and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight .	33.07572447995434
I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn .	31.917424176504245
My objections to the marriage were not merely those , which I last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside , in my own case ;	28.171318453510395
Sure he will not leave London before he has found them .	57.33418259821078
Her aunt assured her that she was ;	74.88758910838867
How it could occur a second time therefore was very odd !	54.54706087150537
it was evident that he was very much in love with her .	41.986817595116435
I know we dine with four and twenty families .	43.54084711243162
He still loves me , and we are engaged .	43.16928610168725
and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers .	34.15010008329752
Bingley of course returned with him to dinner ;	100.25360455050274
Its completion depended on others .	75.08928413690133
It pains me to offend you .	61.02607874755521
And if I had not a letter to write myself , I might sit by you , and admire the evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did .	26.135816556706956
though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible , I instantly resolved on setting off for this place , that I might make my sentiments known to you .	25.334503650655524
His apparent partiality had subsided , his attentions were over , he was the admirer of some one else .	33.13269370615301
but for your sakes , we would do any thing .	60.754115621858155
This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife ;	40.19892320707089
I who knew what he was .	68.15893008442394
All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes .	84.73067426905295
There I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it ;	43.32292113748554
That will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable ;	59.805124133505466
Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ;	60.685146567097554
He did every thing best in the world ;	54.85139634690163
Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these , what would have been her sensations ?	30.437248299662787
Bennet and Kitty walked off , and as soon as they were gone Collins began .	41.15405243976869
Not that I have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body .	46.81523247203783
Miss Bingley told me , said Jane , that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance .	25.585701972117572
she was dying to know what could be his meaning and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him ?	34.49029865090084
I wish I might take this for a compliment ;	71.59399888866972
My father and Maria are to come to me in March , added Charlotte , and I hope you will consent to be of the party .	26.695430581933977
I saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it ;	32.71263505997781
We were always good friends ;	138.2142483241227
The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature , must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance ;	25.31104534924636
This was praise , of all others most extraordinary , most opposite to her ideas .	48.6621076181645
The Gardiners staid only one night at Longbourn , and set off the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement .	20.98132562458523
She was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia , and , removed from the influence of Lydia's example , she became , by proper attention and management , less irritable , less ignorant , and less insipid .	19.42399367525679
My dear father , I congratulate you .	52.2790202790691
and turning round , he looked for a moment at Elizabeth , till catching her eye , he withdrew his own and coldly said , She is tolerable ;	24.837057284613334
He does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from Darcy more than once , but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only .	23.781055836692545
He made her an offer in this very room , and she refused him .	36.03820611816259
Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase , and listened with all her heart ;	38.26442061617383
It was some time , however , before a smile could be extorted from Jane .	30.844543728530088
Sometimes one officer , sometimes another had been her favourite , as their attentions raised them in her opinion .	43.39017689027008
and , therefore , abruptly changing the conversation , talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage .	19.953027585774716
My uncle and aunt and I were to go together ;	73.28619305934977

for on first hearing it , Bennet sat quite still , and unable to utter a syllable .	37.33819192123206
I never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter .	33.76260631039106

for Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law , that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion .	22.368798876842973
] PRIDE AND PREJUDICE : A Novel .	33.92363235679673
You will not , I hope , consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family , my dear Madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter's favour , without having paid yourself and Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf .	18.76804262573646
I have been used to consider poetry as the food of love , said Darcy .	26.15988233366014
She had never heard of his having had any relations , except a father and mother , both of whom had been dead many years .	28.026603332227552
Or in other words , you are determined to have him .	53.416254568007346
and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again , when Bingley , who as well as the other had sat down , suddenly rose , and whispering a few words to her sister , ran out of the room .	17.616235746728577
and secondly , of my room .	59.376072196976104

A little .	340.52220780408254
On the contrary , there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks .	32.403997835252724
and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly , and live in so rational a manner , as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten .	24.00099510929549
and I should be miserable to forfeit it .	37.09174518117761

It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected .	27.490123835988864
and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day .	25.5962828090735
Well , all I know is , that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him .	25.877500532906218
And what claims has Lydia , what attractions has she beyond youth , health , and good humour , that could make him for her sake , forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well ?	18.06864924184693
May I ask to what these questions tend ?	73.27919518439411
They walked on , without knowing in what direction .	74.69299875082214
CHAPTER VII .	223.11563766813362
It was a fortnight since Bennet had been down stairs , but on this happy day , she again took her seat at the head of her table , and in spirits oppressively high .	21.6024720010796
She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on which there could be no difference of sentiment .	31.498732973415137
then some time or other we shall be happy to hear you .	64.82064351447288
causes which , though still existing , and existing to an equal degree in both instances , I had myself endeavoured to forget , because they were not immediately before me .	24.11810676557231
And can you likewise declare , that there is no foundation for it ?	41.20999903297431
I knew it myself , as it was known to Miss Bingley , but her brother is even yet ignorant of it .	28.429323507898904
As long as she stays there , it is all very well .	50.04536620591558
No arguments shall be wanting on my part , that can alleviate so severe a misfortune ;	33.61663365224077
No I cannot talk of books in a ball-room ;	57.645352111519614
I mention it , because it is the living which I ought to have had .	36.535709988512515
I write without any intention of paining you , or humbling myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , cannot be too soon forgotten ;	19.94964412247754
and her calling here was prodigiously civil !	52.44239791557465
She danced next with an officer , and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham , and of hearing that he was universally liked .	24.868048843341235
A thorough , determined dislike of me a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy .	36.07231857766491
Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister , who joined her with a cheerful look , which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors , than Elizabeth .	24.573019010669505
Which do you mean ?	145.1015333288811
Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in Section 4 , Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation .	10.682021678416724
But before she had been three minutes in her own room , her mother followed her .	34.61515432774858
And when you have given your ball , she added , I shall insist on their giving one also .	31.993311648498395
If you received the work on a physical medium , you must return the medium with your written explanation .	31.297083804266425
We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us , said Gardiner , but perhaps to the Lakes .	36.189863395884515
But the case is this .	130.46214790371917
1 .	384.9991185797929
I believe her to be both in a great degree , replied Wickham ;	43.35887389091333
I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow , in comparison with myself , I should not pay him half so much deference .	21.598261002041998
And do you really love him quite well enough ?	74.5047147365422
He has heartily forgiven me now .	59.20536914844953
Yes , indeed , cried Bennet , offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood .	27.51407725417739
My aunt told me so herself on Saturday .	75.81538481330658
As it principally concerns yourself , you ought to know its contents .	40.18732975703848
You are not going to introduce yourself to Darcy ?	54.930938004724595
Something very much to the purpose of course .	77.13183572648114
The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family .	31.343123155994526
She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither ;	50.14903493664234
I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place .	27.686987642478478
but he saw only the father .	92.1023886495577
It would be dreadful !	109.5958333701515
Everything wore a happier aspect .	69.57478816924898
their minds were more vacant than their sisters' , and when nothing better offered , a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening ;	27.21144309679381
I told you so from the first , you may remember .	60.1028043864334
The gentlemen did approach ;	107.96752310560794
They had not been long together , before Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her ;	38.429748825252695
But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was .	37.52442388147212
and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another , might be remarked , he meant to make enquiries at Clapham .	22.757844153631286
Were it known to the rest of my family , I should not have merely my own gratitude to express .	31.606071682621373
If it was to be secret , said Jane , say not another word on the subject .	31.692935741095983
The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn ;	57.62936567963408
and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying there too .	27.049431894489388
she could not but say , after a moment's deliberation , I am not .	37.65331572256387
and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her , she dared not pronounce .	22.690995871432737
and what is to divide them ?	63.910708296014505
The two youngest of the family , Catherine and Lydia , were particularly frequent in these attentions ;	35.56835099618272
I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least .	35.428486355887145
I London : Printed for T Egerton , Military Library , Whitehall .	14.04764198972762
for , what with her board and pocket allowance , and the continual presents in money , which passed to her , through her mother's hands , Lydia's expences had been very little within that sum .	21.783304844035815
Dearest Lizzy , I hardly know what I would write , but I have bad news for you , and it cannot be delayed .	27.78269508582054
It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ;	39.31756715930314
No , not at all .	115.62926806619146
You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking , and thinking for your approbation alone .	28.315394824146995
Come as soon as you can on the receipt of this .	52.92582210295426
he introduced us to his sister .	114.80965557426008
Aye because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield , and he could not help answering her ;	37.480887846307255
Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth : My dearest Lizzy , I FIND myself very unwell this morning , which , I suppose , is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday .	20.701782175396048
and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome , discontented or too poor , she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences , silence their complaints , and scold them into harmony and plenty .	12.081108303949462
but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear .	41.70823656406768
Lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how much he will give her .	28.9133817660937
Elizabeth was delighted .	157.95084275168435
The wish of procuring her regard , which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire , could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this .	20.405948322036455
But it is always so .	106.93762447942214
I did not know before , that I had two daughters on the brink of matrimony .	27.14774316885339
And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment .	21.680657887625017
but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled , and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with .	20.107052862443464
But so we all do .	106.19366424771908
May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment , or are the result of previous study ?	23.877133017167985
But he is , beyond all comparison , the most agreeable man I ever saw and if he becomes really attached to me I believe it will be better that he should not .	28.585765637203018
how shall I bear so much happiness !	110.20856302978021
She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia , with anxious parade , walk up to her mother's right hand , and hear her say to her eldest sister , Ah !	20.42865439692026
They were natural and just .	104.42238178725896
Denny and Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Philips's house , and then made their bows , in spite of Miss Lydia's pressing entreaties that they would come in , and even in spite of Philips' throwing up the parlour window , and loudly seconding the invitation .	17.502112511453664
and if she accepted any refreshment , seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family .	21.776481852080853
He did not talk to me of his own arts , said Fitzwilliam smiling .	40.25550344457056
Pray do not talk of that odious man .	59.230496699362064
It is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half-hour's acquaintance , as to a real , strong attachment .	25.155504539283168
F 1 .	292.5606487562425
every body had been most kind and attentive to him , there had been no formality , no stiffness , he had soon felt acquainted with all the room ;	28.74807306350009
Let me first see how he behaves , said she ;	48.717822017510706
and I should have gone so all the way , if Kitty had not been sick ;	35.77154730798977
but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time , she had the same story to repeat every day .	21.554992871152173
Your daughter Elizabeth , it is presumed , will not long bear the name of Bennet , after her elder sister has resigned it , and the chosen partner of her fate , may be reasonably looked up to , as one of the most illustrious personages in this land .	18.238942563325207
I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this , and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time , without being informed that she was very accomplished .	21.728790268800505
On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared ;	46.679611134083466
72 of La Belle Assemblee 1 st July 1815 ] PRIDE PREJUDICE .	13.715107808024541
In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty , who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments , to make their appearance before .	22.104264542177447
Lakes , mountains , and rivers , shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations ;	26.779254326920643
But surely , said she , I may enter his county with impunity , and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me .	18.806730635358967
He took the hint , and when Mary had finished her second song , said aloud , That will do extremely well , child .	23.03611536948398
and when we got to the George , I do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too .	18.377454367327484
Do not you , Darcy ?	145.2177294075574
The garden in which stands my humble abode , is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park , her ladyship's residence .	25.382567812524503
I shall go distracted .	78.53268963079066
If you were aware , said Elizabeth , of the very great disadvantage to us all , which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded and imprudent manner ;	25.973207820591256
Elizabeth was disgusted , and even Miss Bennet was shocked .	40.81112019402058
You both did as much as you could , in planning the marriage .	49.516452290025605
And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate ;	35.96333489498117
There's for you !	264.4634420109035
my dear , continued Bennet , I am quite delighted with him .	37.61348295840127
Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding ;	44.81574523890228
Elizabeth made no objection ;	123.11257203043724
did you admire me for my impertinence ?	130.74317381572797
The officers may not be so pleasant in General 's regiment .	35.436947859706855
By this time , my dearest sister , you have received my hurried letter ;	48.4240824747063
But not before they went to Brighton ?	92.89384334457012
When that business was over , he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for the indulgence of some music .	36.33192603176727
How much of good or evil must be done by him !	64.29950382191888
only in different lines .	204.34615782270097
Elizabeth , who had a letter to write , went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea ;	35.299252727318006
I think she will .	143.2110616785521
It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane , said she .	33.17652610862253
Miss Bingley offered her the carriage , and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it , when Jane testified such concern in parting with her , that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present .	19.05964008665841
Did Darcy give you his reasons for this interference ?	70.5033601522708
her uncle and aunt stopped also , and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building , the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road , which led behind it to the stables .	20.94618781191852
She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others ;	36.15622701085418
I cannot make him out .	83.11111729835405
Then , observed Elizabeth , you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman .	35.18929396244852
but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me , was a strong inducement .	30.493842669094402
She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her , but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea ;	27.045706826048068
and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society , and from our connection with Rosings , the frequent means of varying the humble home scene , I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome .	18.29149110344481
and he might imagine , from my father's behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that he would do as little , and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter .	28.343521453061914
The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage , explained to her that , by his wife at least , if not by himself , such a hope was cherished .	30.033626759963248
It ought to be so ;	80.73376617027284
Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane .	51.52485319539735
that proud and repulsive as were his manners , she had never , in the whole course of their acquaintance , an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together , and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways , seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits .	16.55209680690273
Do you talk by rule then , while you are dancing ?	51.2244301523335
Oh , lord !	118.99858181000101
But , alas !	103.23426611497854
Your ladyship wants Darcy to marry your daughter ;	94.36971512282908
CHAPTER IX .	223.11563766813362
but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way .	31.920837375988103
It may do very well for the others , replied Bingley ;	57.72680401990503
and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke , joined to the circumstance itself , and many of the circumstances of the preceding day , opened to them a new idea on the business .	23.907743358232064
or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ?	66.98099235174134
Had I been in love , I could not have been more wretchedly blind .	40.452856759130384
But still he would be her husband .	72.64437659462673
He had found the law a most unprofitable study , and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained , if I would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for , and I could not have forgotten my revered father's intentions .	19.53289339044023
I must have my share in the conversation , if you are speaking of music .	31.372435479771895
but her sister's was involved in it , as she thought he must be sensible himself .	34.95823067952028
They shook hands with great cordiality ;	65.73729058463584
Do not charge a fee for access to , viewing , displaying , performing , copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works unless you comply with paragraph 1 .	13.685402464451883
and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance , of his having ten thousand a year .	27.022561322831045
There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer ;	41.654414321842246
and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him , as now , when all love must be vain .	25.19605110023084
Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants .	33.48568178627278
The marriage of a daughter , which had been the first object of her wishes , since Jane was sixteen , was now on the point of accomplishment , and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials , fine muslins , new carriages , and servants .	18.00981111014104
nor could she think , without a smile , of what her ladyship's indignation would have been .	49.051760546069325
and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out .	18.5517881331516
Every thing being settled between them , Darcy's next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in Gracechurch-street the evening before I came home .	27.59710685152094
In as short a time as Collins's long speeches would allow , every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both ;	31.657881622029755
But do not be cast down .	54.15956439394106
I was so vexed to see him stand up with her ;	38.77998636338491
She is grown so brown and coarse !	35.5098953362385
I am very , very sorry .	87.51819796657198
He now wished it more than ever .	66.31102661273584
and in farther justification of Darcy , she could not but allow that Bingley , when questioned by Jane , had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair ;	19.923583860862152
The time fixed for the beginning of their Northern tour was now fast approaching ;	25.420251825493054
But what , said she , after a pause , can have been his motive ?	38.84939397499806
they are married !	284.0936263220866
cried Elizabeth , I am excessively diverted .	55.061482440639885
Could there be finer symptoms ?	114.67910920158336
The possibility of his having really endured such unkindness , was enough to interest all her tender feelings ;	25.16236980854028
he was moving that way ;	128.50971498014619
but with a moment's recollection and a returning smile , replied , that he had formerly seen him often ;	31.780046683341272
And what am I to do on the occasion ?	75.92749452381423
You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns , said Darcy in a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour .	25.924436876159664
I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction , and nobody but a governess can give it .	24.983338082200987
Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth .	74.6784639773891
I expected you to stay two months .	71.82455420088313
Well , but now for my news : it is about dear Wickham ;	48.617993969029804
It was a journey of only twenty-four miles , and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch-street by noon .	26.174624571964994
They have both , said she , been deceived , I dare say , in some way or other , of which we can form no idea .	33.62273292077426
Nor was her respect for him , though it made her more quiet , at all likely to make her more elegant .	36.33989009334458
she cried .	402.14084133784803
Collins moreover adds , I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad business has been so well hushed up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place , should be so generally known .	20.741135052649877
and , as he spoke , he left the room , fatigued with the raptures of his wife .	27.690247125837324
He cannot afford it .	108.27537254110074
and after relating the circumstances , she thus went on : I am now convinced , my dear aunt , that I have never been much in love ;	25.14515143838441
I knew that Wickham ought not to be a clergyman .	49.564807708711555
And they are really to be married !	90.90412892568081
A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other , and out of their three months' acquaintance they had been intimate two .	24.19356584285762
Your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as I said before , they had a great deal of talk together .	31.959471822414898
a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure and affection and intelligence , which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad .	20.23750002956717
Elizabeth went away with her head full of him .	50.94494007580761
and she was perpetually either making some inquiry , or looking at his page .	27.381211696246307
But the horror of what might possibly happen , almost took from me my faculties .	36.813987965918386
At any rate , she cannot grow many degrees worse , without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life .	20.725126358370698
Can you deny that you have done it ?	73.73714978516651
Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother's .	68.73715144565021
You could not have started a more happy idea , since you will not take comfort in mine .	32.15315930402848
No more have I , said Bennet ;	122.11434746153317
Jane was by no means better .	88.4104976380013
Why , at that rate , you will have been here only six weeks .	45.142332409646116
I had not an idea of it .	63.82752675070938
I never saw such a woman .	66.24537745063631
Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid , who continued , though slowly , to mend ;	28.59463879832796
In nine cases out of ten , a woman had better shew more affection than she feels .	36.373052888067285
Elizabeth would wonder , and probably would blame her ;	51.56231046225036
The present unhappy state of the family , rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary ;	22.104999217628272
Darcy took her place by her niece , and they walked on together .	44.89498850053648
But from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed , respecting each circumstance , I shall hope to be in future secured , when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read .	18.133561552530843
and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning .	29.910152699202648
but shortly recovering himself , advanced towards the party , and spoke to Elizabeth , if not in terms of perfect composure , at least of perfect civility .	22.696627446407234
I know it all ;	128.81309141941017
La !	561.1845026368452
I know of nobody that is coming I am sure , unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in , and I hope my dinners are good enough for her .	24.449387108969653
You must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm works .	13.533782308691082
Elizabeth could not but be pleased , could not but triumph .	48.31696443629207
In spite of this amendment , however , she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn , desiring her mother to visit Jane , and form her own judgment of her situation .	20.081094949262994
is not this an agreeable surprise ?	145.95981368409002
He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be , and unconsciously closed his book .	28.81575685064468
But we considered it , we talked of it as impossible .	49.50449880253091
I can hardly write for laughing .	68.25482678281635
Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment , before their approach was announced by the door-bell , and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room .	19.378784310760146
Her aunt now called her to look at a picture .	69.41247879410972
CHAPTER XI .	234.75576465601785
Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Bennet .	60.311044709949435
Come be quick , be quick !	139.6963572008472
She could neither wonder nor condemn , but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom , afforded no palliation of her distress .	18.039533129592808
Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh , said Elizabeth .	48.83389966445861
Five daughters successively entered the world , but yet the son was to come ;	39.364701429958465
I do not know when I have been more shocked , said she .	33.2931556642656
Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object .	78.99563943336908
I know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you ;	36.66764449647919
Your attendance upon her , has been too much for you .	53.851860467978554
I am sick of Bingley , cried his wife .	39.57710185331331
How can you be so silly , cried her mother , as to think of such a thing , in all this dirt !	33.711739376900155
That is a failing indeed !	68.88988643004829
The Foundation makes no representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United States .	19.94865279558845
but that Charlotte could encourage him , seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself , and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum , and she could not help crying out , Engaged to Collins !	18.154409860517283
Had they been only ten minutes sooner , they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination , for it was plain that he was that moment arrived , that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage .	21.36008733189867
Do not be afraid of my running into any excess , of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will .	24.29418300339392
Certainly , Sir ;	247.14124755663084
Elizabeth , feeling really anxious , was determined to go to her , though the carriage was not to be had ;	34.34223374681666
or in other words , to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more .	38.380738236025415
I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that .	38.68044382834017
Sir William only smiled .	120.76737905643918
and his son will be just like him just as affable to the poor .	32.35477942443993
She seems a very pleasant young woman , said Bingley .	47.62325633930544
but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature , as the compliment deserved .	30.305777320801113
but I am an idle fellow , and though I have not many , I have more than I ever look into .	29.156212499625052
Now I am quite happy , said she , for you will be as happy as myself .	42.95180338446838
but amongst other causes of disquiet , she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour ;	22.221313186217326
It was a large , handsome , stone building , standing well on rising ground , and backed by a ridge of high woody hills ;	13.00368542035202
she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion , five and twenty years ago .	31.849790289287718
it was a better sized room , and had a pleasanter aspect ;	36.95577360482285
Do not you know that Collins wants to marry Lizzy ?	68.98869255849603
You are uniformly charming !	87.69608725900984
org Section 4 .	144.19461219075853
Elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them .	23.653041244210343
We have reason to imagine that his aunt , lady Catherine de Bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye .	20.147100933703122
For what do we live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ?	41.66700330446791
but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley .	58.96703905894248
Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display ;	37.66162702089901
When I have a house of my own , I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library .	35.532376174361545
But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away ;	43.500253452112844
but respecting his abilities , and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself , she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook , and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which , in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children , was so highly reprehensible .	15.489929687532904
She read , with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension , and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes .	21.33063990510633
To Gardiner , Wickham had one means of affording pleasure , unconnected with his general powers .	31.693165063561946
It is not of peculiar , but of general evils , which I am now complaining .	32.92525741455316
and I am happy to say , there will be some little money , even when all his debts are discharged , to settle on my niece , in addition to her own fortune .	22.678823575294718
This is the consequence you see , Madam , of marrying a daughter , said Elizabeth .	42.98286956444125
and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday , could have made such a Friday , Saturday , Sunday and Monday , endurable to Kitty and Lydia .	20.76094585046553
On reaching the house , they were shewn through the hall into the saloon , whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer .	20.05562990840026
Wickham only shook his head .	125.44435282033689
where else can they be so well concealed ?	99.8641342246905
This roused a general astonishment ;	130.32504601763299
said she .	372.7761627948212
and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be as well to be silent .	26.349805073207854
But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you , who is very pretty , and I dare say , very agreeable .	26.946426524380723
but when questioned by him Denny denied knowing any thing of their plan , and would not give his real opinion about it .	23.550167049078297
When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure , she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment .	28.76311730661379
He must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to live on .	32.918136855725436
and that his character was by no means so faulty , nor Wickham's so amiable , as they had been considered in Hertfordshire .	29.069739246600793
Till I have your disposition , your goodness , I never can have your happiness .	49.36349707362282
I do not like to boast of my own child , but to be sure , Jane one does not often see any body better looking .	24.553511488041664
and when they next met , he looked at her only to criticise .	34.879359263218376
Were it for nothing but his love of you , I must always have esteemed him ;	51.093565735207825
his formal civility was just what it had been , and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family .	30.134491473377867
and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents .	28.358582750404953
but , alas !	123.23559935612874
This invaluable friend was a very young woman , and very lately married .	43.64236297445243
Of whom does Jane ever think ill ?	109.5556543791505
The faces of both , however , were tolerably calm ;	36.92299921345413
I am only ashamed of his asking so little .	43.65098828720492
F3 .	843.1429980086798
Your uncle !	406.3845028789299
but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme .	64.37102326854861
I never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses .	36.50117119822437
I told my sister Philips so the other day .	68.41699824435614
It is useless to talk of it .	48.03945465670995
If we thought alike of Miss Bingley , replied Jane , your representation of all this , might make me quite easy .	34.589598658089514
and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give the praise where it was due .	21.170993556162664
Did not you ?	340.7622600393751
It must be an amusing study .	58.9311666979087
and after a short silence Bennet began repeating her thanks to Bingley for his kindness to Jane , with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy .	23.706891631317873
He is the kind of man , indeed , to whom I should never dare refuse any thing , which he condescended to ask .	25.207969027394586
that abominable Darcy !	247.58683923268433
What an excellent father you have , girls , said she , when the door was shut .	41.82688567413024
Does she live near you , sir ?	80.67320233168279
I see no occasion for that .	74.2991453475429
Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty , but she smiled too much .	37.62833202621484
She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable .	28.910643173681347
but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood , and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess .	19.021477651281806
and when he did speak , it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety , not a pleasure to himself .	28.194293521480134
but on the third , her repining was over , and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once , on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere .	21.959695653325486
and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds .	24.9802501032085
Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you , and wants him to marry Miss Darcy .	31.04426238042384
and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice .	19.62037773103913
With them he is remarkably agreeable .	100.56890373146457
I never met with anybody who delighted me so much .	39.25105401853387
CHAPTER VII .	223.11563766813362
Why must their marriage be private ?	115.9374133739164
I speak nothing but the truth .	79.58060112260739
The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart ;	48.19503779158926
If Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin , why is not he to make another choice ?	36.93274882324484
Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight , when she should enter the room .	49.09411595838106
In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society .	31.7623294135528
cried Elizabeth .	274.15392210803657
and what with the Philipses , the Lucases , and the officers , there was not a day without its engagement .	29.11620360625898
I am sorry you think so ;	73.58024806383129
There are a few things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works even without complying with the full terms of this agreement .	22.865336752401276
On that head , therefore , I shall be uniformly silent ;	41.23576414870495
and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust , naturally inclined my father to be of service to him , and on George Wickham , who was his god-son , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed .	19.66432147563527
You persist , then , in supposing his sisters influence him .	44.75994594406327
The surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great ;	34.112444338880685
Ten thousand a year , and very likely more !	56.79069386809409
It was first broken by Annesley , a genteel , agreeable-looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse , proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others ;	18.84697220408248
Lady Catherine observed , after dinner , that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits , and immediately accounting for it herself , by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon , she added , But if that is the case , you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer .	21.721513471915582
His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention , the first to listen and to pity , the first to be admired ;	30.62837496600441
I cannot but wonder , however , at her having any such fears now , because , if he had at all cared about me , we must have met long , long ago .	25.711447228546817
What will Wickham say ?	159.7836560196276
Elizabeth , though she did not credit above half of what was said , believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister's ruin still more certain ;	23.68772214202384
And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice ?	41.81598587113658
Another time , Lizzy , said her mother , I would not dance with him , if I were you .	31.70419691716751
She had ventured only one glance at Darcy .	50.11283589385715
My dear Lizzy , they must have passed within ten miles of us .	35.8272316675199
His affection for her soon sunk into indifference ;	57.951263310975726
but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty .	35.922014037762715
Kitty simpered and smiled , and hoped her turn was coming soon .	49.401006583781346
and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another , and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be .	23.068459951268622
What did Colonel Forster say ?	98.73559370607646
and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths , quite mistake the matter .	28.38547048852949
But to expose the former faults of any person , without knowing what their present feelings were , seemed unjustifiable .	40.57608119406545
Not so much as I could wish , Sir ;	82.89813974259677
Both sisters were uncomfortable enough .	101.11855615180254
she cried .	402.14084133784803
Pray do , my dear Miss Lucas , she added in a melancholy tone , for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me , I am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves .	20.147884200605137
With no expectation of pleasure , but with the strongest curiosity , Elizabeth opened the letter , and to her still increasing wonder , perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper , written quite through , in a very close hand .	18.203075097655713
Ever since I have known it , I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it .	30.31436684991261
Nobody can tell what I suffer !	117.45105791316779
Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister ;	58.715691089084466
Very much .	439.1845439616887
I do not deserve it .	53.84820074904952
Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman , and he was thinking of her with some complacency , when thus accosted by Miss Bingley , I can guess the subject of your reverie .	20.786445514116288
He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room .	30.645385601055544
On finding Bennet , Elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words , May I hope , Madam , for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth , when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ?	18.26810267479355
Kitty and me were to spend the day there , and Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening ;	38.81499228197437
Darcy bowed .	290.023179787665
but her spirits returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be duped , by the sister at least .	37.394147410624434
Where shall you change horses ?	121.67003891090164
We all love to instruct , though we can teach only what is not worth knowing .	38.02909705047293
They attacked him in various ways ;	59.42567098197024
That he should even speak to her was amazing !	63.330061395429524
He was struggling for the appearance of composure , and would not open his lips , till he believed himself to have attained it .	20.99532938920872
She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight , and was certain of a willing listener in Jane , whenever she might wish to talk again of either .	20.895901259414995
The tumult of her mind was now painfully great .	41.83933576871398
Oh , yes !	155.41443917661368
and the respect which he felt for her high rank , and his veneration for her as his patroness , mingling with a very good opinion of himself , of his authority as a clergyman , and his rights as a rector , made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness , self-importance and humility .	15.76707924588806
But , perhaps his sister does as well for the present , and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her .	30.746536071863943
but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to .	55.59991268747771
The first week of their return was soon gone .	73.53397370450651
It mortifies me .	100.08677009872912
Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood ;	50.30368703506298
I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more about it , and to ask when Denny comes back from town .	31.332721945137042
but if that be the case , there can at least be no want of subject .	42.870013914993365
It must have been his sister's doing .	70.88335407264319
and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning .	28.70938269356155
Collins's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter , to whom they could give little fortune ;	44.20729875315856
but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish .	26.141111485932484
and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship's carriage was ready to take them all home .	24.812444123522084
The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent , had made a great difference in the country , and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees .	22.653790413324923
But you are not entitled to know mine ;	52.53507251803558
cried Elizabeth .	274.15392210803657
Jane looked at her doubtingly .	93.57551968863692
E9 .	531.6294007955007
The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished ;	56.70129330012258
Had she found Jane in any apparent danger , Bennet would have been very miserable ;	47.01330688813058
These are home questions and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature .	32.26015110323677
And if not able to please himself in the arrangement , he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice .	26.583600394720182
In the first place , replied Gardiner , there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland .	27.727152012685433
In Three Volumes .	99.42297781597165
More thoughtfulness , and less anxiety to please than when they last met , were plainly expressed .	37.31330660235791
His former acquaintance had been numerous ;	70.35096876841347
There was no one therefore who could be pointed out , as likely to give any news of him .	30.127306936418094
' Allow me , by the way , to observe , my fair cousin , that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer .	19.397642803409582
It has been most unconsciously done , however , and I hope will be of short duration .	24.888952423429444
and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood .	36.832391428129284
Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings , and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them .	35.59714494955291
Other books were produced , and after some deliberation he chose Fordyce's Sermons .	32.62622436637569
He found her as handsome as she had been last year ;	47.57249417208648
and it was certain , that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one , whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his weakest side .	25.616661989229602
Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory .	61.05134496969693
But here he was set right by Bennet , who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook , and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen .	22.303034878076012
Her character will be fixed , and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous .	35.70616954538326
Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole Park , but feared it might be beyond a walk .	34.291481939033815
and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins , the excellence of its cookery was owing .	29.804383544497846
She was now in an irritation as violent from delight , as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation .	25.08281532247247
She was immediately told , that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence ;	38.616722020183595
Bingley and Jane , however , soon allowed the others to outstrip them .	42.717760207284414

If you mean Darcy , cried her brother , he may go to bed , if he chuses , before it begins but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing ;	28.538210552138942
No , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems likely to rain ;	30.152921054012808
but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given , to remind her of her post .	25.193351188205696
They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching ;	18.900686954903215
but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went , for neither Lydia nor Collins were once silent .	31.604287256783127
no .	1002.6479946958726
yes I understand you perfectly .	178.2351259838731
On applying to see the place , they were admitted into the hall ;	39.26437517449624
You know how I detest it , unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner .	34.700891225040465
he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it .	24.33406670659184
It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side ;	30.19857516303192
it came from Netherfield , and the servant waited for an answer .	55.731068076864446
Four weeks passed away , and Jane saw nothing of him .	52.6594544213488
but in vain .	163.2214258366208
Darcy replied with great intrepidity , Miss Elizabeth Bennet .	78.03482395377507
The gentleman experienced some change of feeling ;	62.48603671350805
I was obliged to confess one thing , which for a time , and not unjustly , offended him .	27.30305628491181
After many pauses and many trials of other subjects , Elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first , and saying , I am astonished at his intimacy with Bingley !	23.45856328353344
Darcy took up a book ;	144.97656736347207
When she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ;	41.45619809280844
I felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in marriage , because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right .	30.316057160473594
To this speech Bingley made no answer ;	72.65925436565423
A young man , such as you describe Bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks , and when accident separates them , so easily forgets her , that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent .	18.540346523070934
I hope at least he has not deceived us .	50.21426308086844
and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit .	22.635112448009455
but that it was no worse , she had need to be thankful .	35.41010763337408
but no one was less likely than Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life .	33.87674773556511
You are very ill .	122.03567323525303
Lady Catherine's great attentions to Collins you have been a daily witness of ;	41.49638023075775
Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter , and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again .	26.6718486718313
Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Bennet and the children .	47.09422797117858
Elizabeth was again deep in thought , and after a time exclaimed , To treat in such a manner , the god-son , the friend , the favourite of his father !	24.014471396099815
and she dwelt with energy on his many merits , as they proceeded together up the great staircase .	25.88587435583631
About a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in London ;	33.32981773280038
They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse ;	32.346748364540595
It was reasonable , however , to hope , that they would not continue long .	28.562377187389426
I am exceedingly gratified , said Bingley , by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper .	23.978691900659687
Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed ?	72.31326090474036
So , he enquired who she was , and got introduced , and asked her for the two next .	38.500542973353824
The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed , except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention .	25.76333091536601
Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory ;	43.20318089452274
Not that I shall though , she added to herself , as she finished the letter ;	47.51784478571646
a sense of very great ill usage , and most painful regrets at his being what he is .	38.527101568167716
My motive for cautioning you , is as follows .	59.879431300073904
He acknowledged the truth of it all ;	77.73579540966139
But little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there .	36.147924327177485
one I will not mention ;	200.66199011187825
A scheme of which every part promises delight , can never be successful ;	50.77025207375299
See <FILENAME> or <FILENAME> : ( <URL> ) or ( <URL> ) Images of the original pages are available through Internet Archive .	16.28908994640895
She did not fear her father's opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means , that she , his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her , was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till Darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile .	16.573797945494494
and after laughing at her some time , allowed her at last to go saying , as she quitted the room , If any young men come for Mary or Kitty , send them in , for I am quite at leisure .	24.197296040800154
and fearful , on the contrary , as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long , she urged Jane to borrow Bingley's carriage immediately , and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned , and the request made .	17.56439502549419
She looked at Jane , and smiled , and shook her head by turns .	25.20520772547929
Yes , and her petticoat ;	79.33471464898466
I would go and see her , if I could have the carriage .	54.77201773100158
How was that possible ?	211.36579847148877
It was over at last however .	82.053831429422
avoiding Bennet as much as possible , saying not much to Elizabeth , and nothing at all to the others .	38.29993851559822
here comes Hill .	241.66714208453996
This was invitation enough .	125.38179589526169
' She did indeed .	203.072408948421
Lady Catherine listened to half a song , and then talked , as before , to her other nephew ;	27.303160001798336
But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought , and think only of what will make me happy , your affection , and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt .	21.57248911088681
Their powers of conversation were considerable .	106.71155681648246
Miss Bingley , said he , has given me credit for more than can be .	38.498155098608855
We know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode .	44.38563853165476
At such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth , though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband .	19.61940910452232
To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love ;	41.650550228267946
for who would object to such a partner ?	81.14113589813059
He placed himself by her .	86.76053144928395
You know my mother's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends .	33.52014703043654
Excuse my interference .	215.26319630904837
That she should receive an offer of marriage from Darcy !	72.3177375082562
But Elizabeth had now recollected herself , and making a strong effort for it , was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished her all imaginable happiness .	20.752737578821634
The hall , the dining-room , and all its furniture were examined and praised ;	29.12880349331651
I will sit in my library , in my night cap and powdering gown , and give as much trouble as I can , or , perhaps , I may defer it , till Kitty runs away .	21.633793220338532
But it ended in nothing , and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again .	24.83620072392424
Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over , and , though determined not to slacken as a correspondent , it was for the sake of what had been , rather than what was .	22.884611515941188
There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same , but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh , I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters .	16.915041753144788
She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest , but Jane with all possible mildness declined interfering ;	28.761081709615542
She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte's observation , and hurried her away to her room .	17.78760575964456
But you forget , mama , said Elizabeth , that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that Long has promised to introduce him .	19.98289917735396
Wickham indeed had gone to her , on their first arrival in London , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her .	29.259366161607957
Have you never happened to see her there ?	65.4824980266827
Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane , while she was ill at Netherfield ?	42.23169399777797
Oh !	298.0706733468098
Conjectures as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her brain ;	27.876051004316878
She answered with equal indifference and brevity , and the other said no more .	36.57551172169639
I dislike it very much , he replied ;	69.2873045232116
For herself she was humbled ;	133.83881252339856
It certainly is a most iniquitous affair , said Bennet , and nothing can clear Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn .	19.838343502692336
Why any fear of detection ?	102.74338518959287
Bennet all amazement , though flattered by having a guest of such high importance , received her with the utmost politeness .	31.558618317998675
cried he , with an air of awkward gallantry ;	60.392426952670995
cried Lydia .	387.0121116606393
About a month ago I received this letter , and about a fortnight ago I answered it , for I thought it a case of some delicacy , and requiring early attention .	28.199407605222014
They were within twenty yards of each other , and so abrupt was his appearance , that it was impossible to avoid his sight .	22.8869240914244
When this information was given , and they had all taken their seats , Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire , and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment , that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings ;	19.37446014003453
To Catherine and Lydia , neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting .	41.82857513215304
He listened to her with perfect indifference , while she chose to entertain herself in this manner , and as his composure convinced her that all was safe , her wit flowed long .	24.88025585034234
It is something to think of , and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions .	27.061231101793705
This son was to join in cutting off the entail , as soon as he should be of age , and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for .	22.79010208564922
there is nothing marked in its lines .	97.14379139093425
and in her air altogether , there is a self-sufficiency without fashion , which is intolerable .	28.961597600448712
I do not pretend to regret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire , except your society , my dearest friend ;	24.60306429454896
Her astonishment , as she reflected on what had passed , was increased by every review of it .	31.89882767375268
she times them ill .	169.0018854437621
Darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as Gracechurch Street , but he would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities , were he once to enter it ;	21.10140630773026
CHAPTER XVII .	223.11563766813362
Not yet , replied Jane .	139.75669724919737
but I do not know when that will be .	54.84349039164859
The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucas's last week ;	33.03072630153402
She expressed her gratitude again , but it was too painful a subject to each , to be dwelt on farther .	28.660201848179845
Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical .	66.52803126736717
Here , leading the way through every walk and cross walk , and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for , every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind .	20.74806263486909
Elizabeth could hardly help smiling , as she assured her that had not been the case .	43.319487649961495
though , when the letters were read , Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen .	36.08642487566766
and you , yourself , when last at Longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man , who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him .	22.838203641536683
and Collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment ;	21.630432253497585
Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount , and Elizabeth silently consented .	28.208105143333114
And what sort of young lady is she ?	60.29247280674145
She was engaged one day as she walked , in re-perusing Jane's last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by Darcy , she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her .	18.576339049361543
It would have spared her , she thought , one sleepless night out of two .	33.92462308190253
who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself .	24.85087353435852
to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think , than such as did not .	53.53865022163467
But your arts and allurements may , in a moment of infatuation , have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family .	29.861783917893252
This unfortunate affair will , I fear , prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day .	34.2372673754902
It convinced her , that accident only could discover to Bingley her sister's being in town .	36.779676915066524
He had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research ;	23.58568194388977
E9 .	531.6294007955007
I am afraid , Darcy , observed Miss Bingley , in a half whisper , that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes .	19.140868444338423
On this point she was soon satisfied ;	109.67072619527823
He began to wish to know more of her , and as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others .	24.904489048519658
The compliment to herself and her sister , was not unfelt .	46.25514472489927
You must not blame my aunt .	88.34738833816488
has she any family ?	257.81655001574774
She was very wrong in singling me out as she did ;	42.518048763249396
Yet , indeed , I am in earnest .	79.65608048462573
I am sure you must feel it so .	48.344303935387636
You are charmingly group'd , and appear to uncommon advantage .	23.897393888000906
Let us hope for better things .	97.53437703368014
Charlotte's first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness ;	52.77656864553291
give a loose to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you cannot greatly err .	24.761403402254576
it was melancholy to leave her to such society !	73.04777720370035
Bennet , accompanied by her two youngest girls , reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast .	36.111600488857576
always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body !	53.343804489115065
And in the wretched state of his own finances , there was a very powerful motive for secrecy , in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia's relations , for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him , to a very considerable amount .	15.611211033181773
Her heart was divided between concern for her sister , and resentment against all the others .	27.479845804550017
I am sure I know none so handsome ;	49.25619365762612
Were the whole arrangement complete , my disappointment would be certain .	57.212494028738014
its object was nothing less , than to secure her from any return of Collins's addresses , by engaging them towards herself .	49.63426967015607
Catherine was disconcerted , and made no answer ;	69.33523733653425
Elizabeth was surprised , however , that Wickham should consent to such a scheme , and , had she consulted only her own inclination , any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes .	21.99510474722927
But she is too much like her brother , very , very proud .	55.20009913838308
His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party ;	41.44660854706301
Not yet , however , in spite of her disappointment in her husband , did Bennet give up the point .	32.161999942906576
Colonel Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity , proved that he was generally different , which her own knowledge of him could not have told her ;	26.465059792290457
CHAPTER XVI .	234.75576465601785
We are not on friendly terms , and it always gives me pain to meet him , but I have no reason for avoiding him but what I might proclaim to all the world ;	23.823071101800817
I have not seen her for many years , but I very well remember that I never liked her , and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent .	24.28225452041417
I am perfectly serious in my refusal .	54.1435970637292
You may well be surprised , Miss Bennet , at such an assertion , after seeing , as you probably might , the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday .	29.145172286164595
But it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations , and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for her , for a woman who had already refused him , as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham .	18.322615818059557
no wonder if they love her better .	112.85209145850153
He could be still amiable , still pleasing , to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town ;	34.003960977819645
It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long expectations .	30.234023190563338
I perfectly comprehend your feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been .	29.403485194488624
The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits , in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share .	24.985376816314407
From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach , and with many speeches of thankfulness on Collins's side , and as many bows on Sir William's , they departed .	19.772424269818146
The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world , though only a few weeks before , when Lydia had first run away , they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune .	17.355638885014148
The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse , or covering a skreen .	21.547325194682333
Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia ;	93.60519766036477
As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night ;	25.112475336693393
Elizabeth , however , had never been blind to the impropriety of her father's behaviour as a husband .	29.920214857158264
The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic .	33.58238119171059
Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton .	86.46811884904076
and in their brother's manners there was something better than politeness ;	45.067023228906436
Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight .	69.6433720901479
Yes the late Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift .	33.63142830705559
Lady Lucas herself has often said so , and envied me Jane's beauty .	41.377024543142774
We will go round the Park every day .	61.045289862775405
What would she have said ?	182.96216523586347
Of Collins and Lizzy .	201.24732440731864
and his civilities were worn out like his information .	44.555257478613136
Three daughters married !	242.71485835830663
but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just ;	30.659627133239447
One does not know what to think .	93.08669323111802
She resolved to give her the information herself , and therefore charged Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner , to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family .	24.12128158975158
I have heard much of your master's fine person , said Gardiner , looking at the picture ;	27.542320668831376
They may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more exceptionable purpose .	30.528968017662876
Elizabeth could not refuse , though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit .	30.58829314708912
But every body is to judge for themselves , and the Lucases are very good sort of girls , I assure you .	24.529111273653037
And as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses , to buy them , after they are married .	27.288889065025327
I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular , but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish .	24.126331941884484
She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her , must be the work of her brother , and without looking farther , it was satisfactory ;	21.87779189015599
advised her to return to bed , and promised her some draughts .	47.62156469052654
His regiment is there ;	182.31235696873784
END OF THE SECOND VOLUME .	44.058927062773414
Stay , stay , I will go myself .	83.00124321963122
did not I mention it to you ?	114.58886588705369
Elizabeth privately added , And how much I shall have to conceal .	46.294578449446064
And with these words he hastily left the room , and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house .	27.001105279131686
This match , to which you have the presumption to aspire , can never take place .	39.75719746288048
Exceedingly well .	293.4307966866083
But he paid her not the smallest attention , till her grandfather's death made her mistress of this fortune .	30.485750641839786
and yet there have been things enough happened in the time .	42.77471403882653
Without allowing herself time for consideration , and scarcely knowing what she felt , Elizabeth on finishing this letter , instantly seized the other , and opening it with the utmost impatience , read as follows : it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first .	19.029748954441303
The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire , lest she should suffer from the change of room ;	24.55088744345639
I am glad it occurred to me to mention it ;	40.5129630342245
but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us , for she went up stairs half an hour ago .	23.327692172249034
CHAPTER XIII .	223.11563766813362
An easy distance do you call it ?	86.22982673196132
Lizzy , cried her mother , remember where you are , and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home .	26.675467890880448
and , to imitate his politeness , she began , as they met , to admire the beauty of the place ;	31.314087010373335
Then taking the disengaged arm of Darcy , she left Elizabeth to walk by herself .	44.31047844650925
But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general .	33.00696995047407
Nothing child , nothing .	192.72423407318152
It was possible , however , that some of his companions in the shire , might be able to give more information ;	22.104585717857212
Well , cried Elizabeth , have it as you choose .	57.81873887927625
but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him , her anger was turned against herself ;	25.282637096893996
Had it been your uncle's doing , I must and would have paid him ;	54.60777906221547
She assured him that no one intended to play , and the silence of the whole party on the subject , seemed to justify her .	23.901106813713596
She was shewn into the breakfast-parlour , where all but Jane were assembled , and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise .	24.39268879497007
and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away .	33.96042021308778
The observations of her uncle and aunt now began ;	49.38945248430765
Elizabeth made no answer ;	104.12370961632355
I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home , and see if I can make it up any better .	23.757819213357802
He must be an oddity , I think , said she .	48.828758535596094
How can you talk so ?	118.00814190903937
Has she been presented ?	193.32894133521873
There were some very strong objections against the lady , were Colonel Fitzwilliam's words , and these strong objections probably were , her having one uncle who was a country attorney , and another who was in business in London .	24.01631231977132
I shall see her again !	90.48296974198922
But her mind was so busily engaged , that she did not always know when she was silent .	29.403492763569673
though often standing within a very short distance of her , quite disengaged , he never came near enough to speak .	37.26287194048556
Yes , there was something in that ;	76.56877513403379
After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ;	28.740223470762615
Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention .	79.07061101712968
It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match .	25.794469449363653
Beyond a doubt , they do wish him to chuse Miss Darcy , replied Jane ;	45.62654398228767
But of course she did not mention my name to you .	55.57570723258734
But as no such delicacy restrained her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back , she should think herself very ill used .	19.381659492491742
Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts ;	40.88574482274462
If he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to Long .	38.13703291577393
' Those were your words .	126.34128791810245
It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life .	21.29680060887848
Her nose wants character ;	102.50067441128688
but depend upon it I will carry my point .	38.82961514408047
Gratitude , not merely for having once loved her , but for loving her still well enough , to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him , and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection .	19.294763486832583
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again , having still a great deal to say to her , and many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends .	28.548710520552113
Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves .	84.195048482949
and in your heart , you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you .	24.89379461274224
Oh !	298.0706733468098
Yes , and I had heard it before .	67.92587171545328
As he said this , she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer .	35.67548848433376
Her colour changed , and she said no more .	59.02447450244957
Such formidable accounts of her Ladyship , and her manner of living , quite frightened Maria Lucas , who had been little used to company , and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings , with as much apprehension , as her father had done to his presentation at James's .	19.347348229054056
When they had gained their own room , Jane taking out the letter , said , This is from Caroline Bingley ;	35.068227779183424
Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest , and then , sick of this folly , took refuge in her own room , that she might think with freedom .	23.16725392851016
The rector of a parish has much to do .	50.6313615863857
You forced me into visiting him last year , and promised if I went to see him , he should marry one of my daughters .	28.186059801040575
She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors , she wanted to compose her own , and to make herself agreeable to all ;	28.064773024126982
Pardon me for interrupting you , Madam , cried Collins ;	48.332539427506816
;	3364.132888770684
Society has claims on us all ;	99.3189634761854
They were rather handsome , had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town , had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds , were in the habit of spending more than they ought , and of associating with people of rank ;	17.560419565933834
and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn .	33.74105555020614
After this day , Jane said no more of her indifference .	63.46583128813348
and now we are better .	88.9049620030225
Your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you .	44.86088034632912
There is some sense in what he says about the girls however ;	50.437709923506354
and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself .	38.820240715564736
Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me .	73.54093849924074
Lady Catherine herself says that in point of true beauty , Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex ;	23.27180132329694
thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together ;	67.41885696031117
Had I but explained some part of it only some part of what I learnt , to my own family !	34.28421346915223
Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue ;	43.10465151771725
I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love !	26.78635312162846
when we met at Pemberley .	154.37518546804122
My temper would perhaps be called resentful .	74.25580561768946
You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world .	22.01507374623798
I did not know that you intended to walk , said Miss Bingley , in some confusion , lest they had been overheard .	21.993115306472273
It was all over before I arrived ;	71.85264621326401
cried Elizabeth , as soon as they were by themselves .	43.804002691636484
Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in .	76.83860629673455
wished his fair cousins health and happiness again , and promised their father another letter of thanks .	37.20876456042455
This was spoken jestingly , but it appeared to her so just a picture of Darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer ;	28.9606503539322
Miss Bingley , however , was incapable of disappointing Darcy in any thing , and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives .	19.874670929191307
Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded ;	35.06882900406301
He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins , from a conviction that if they saw him depart , they could not fail to conjecture his design , and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise ;	19.31465507210197
and she could not help remembering what Charlotte's opinion had always been .	34.64035050019307
CHAPTER XIV .	223.11563766813362
Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable .	61.74745477074469
In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended ;	39.65435838982376
Well , then , you need not be under any alarm .	40.334607696377894
I think she will be pleased with the hermitage .	39.88960009167034
Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error , and seek to clear one , without involving the other .	22.48371258569656
If they believed him attached to me , they would not try to part us ;	36.612592058212314
but he eluded the skill of them all ;	48.87994818507333
Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me .	50.21322049274598
And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen .	19.769984451764152
She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman ;	49.66249720072494
I am all astonishment .	83.46286126072755
The conversation soon turned upon fishing , and she heard Darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport .	14.625237091068184
Dearest Jane !	390.34436168653633
The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy ;	53.949008595122265
And accordingly she did turn , and they walked towards the Parsonage together .	40.72584921761494
and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September , than any body else in the country .	24.284706938989093
I will make no promise of the kind .	53.899408339551265
But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was .	24.900570839937995
Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine , what is to befall her ?	33.006747260306604
I have been a selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle .	31.524793897872897
My dearest child , she cried , I can think of nothing else !	46.94351416287542
and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia , her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost importance , and till he entered the room , the misery of her impatience was severe .	21.43866329778244
Some acquaintance or other , my dear , I suppose ;	62.34204288732242
Oh !	298.0706733468098
The venison was roasted to a turn and everybody said , they never saw so fat a haunch .	24.796468532430413
Your picture may be very exact , Louisa , said Bingley ;	51.076911228199826
That he has neither integrity nor honour .	70.8106364345474
On and Gardiner's coming up , they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment ;	35.4421417744625
nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion .	35.20881541698081
and you cannot imagine how well he looked !	83.1882600030596
How he lived I know not .	115.81118240286077
She has two nieces of her own .	65.66934972738923
But tell me , what did you come down to Netherfield for ?	54.836487861672786
and when I am in town it is pretty much the same .	46.01969994699803
Many small donations ( $1 to $5 , 000 ) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS .	14.980432739888462
Very well .	280.41673424364103
Oh !	298.0706733468098
It is of all subjects my delight .	63.978153010101714
I am sorry to hear that ;	62.49630197388259
and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of Lydia's leaving home .	36.89556265662323
A gentleman and a stranger !	164.79217606507922
He sat with them above an hour , and was in remarkably good spirits .	37.73247858249393
Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia ;	30.358843243745312
what is the matter ?	270.95164824318397
The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia , depended less on any single event , or any particular person , for though they each , like Elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with Wickham , he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them , and a ball was at any rate , a ball .	22.18174870991848
Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ;	44.43984065415895
and pray tell her from me , that she cannot expect to excel , if she does not practise a great deal .	22.355881830380582
I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things .	32.690112176328
They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room ;	42.084534087654355
nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family .	27.764548848386376
Is my father in town ?	194.22260876448527
If I could but see you as happy !	104.55458251797477
You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling , I am sure you did .	33.95232912215544
It was not till the afternoon , when he joined them at tea , that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject ;	28.571113644239706
Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves , vanity to what we would have others think of us .	35.36661333215215
Heaven forbid !	273.3801452113293
Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule ;	106.05215015298052
And of your infliction , cried Elizabeth with energy .	59.24592583388748
From what he said of Miss Darcy , I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , reserved , disagreeable girl .	28.278696925523924
Their other aunt also visited them frequently , and always , as she said , with the design of cheering and heartening them up , though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of Wickham's extravagance or irregularity , she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them .	16.733133244270096
Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday ?	76.63773034146466
Without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ;	30.945187496806312
I depend on you for that .	86.0194853986825
I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it ;	33.89228003614011
In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike , she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man's affection , and though her intentions did not vary for an instant , she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive ;	17.24015296135666
I can remember no symptom of affection on either side ;	37.78215124649323
Your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions ;	38.278653282137725
If you should have no objection to receive me into your house , I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family , Monday , November 18th , by four o'clock , and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se'night following , which I can do without any inconvenience , as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday , provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day .	16.075834854007393
She knew not how to support herself , and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour .	22.45395116561958
for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation .	25.441147624341838
Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Miss Bennet ;	24.2338907394926
She replied in the affirmative .	73.79109711658226
What is it you mean ?	135.16472112598876
You must feel it ;	109.39676011239071
Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play , she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer .	19.019716730928096
You must come and make Lizzy marry Collins , for she vows she will not have him , and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her .	27.533498139221535
replied her sister .	319.2245539051798
I might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little endeavour at civility , I am thus rejected .	25.6132781675916
I can easily believe it .	68.37847695698937
Jane , I take your place now , and you must go lower , because I am a married woman .	35.80765128797379
He took the hint , and soon began with , This seems a very comfortable house .	38.72078329817388
and from all Bingley's connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it , from that very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him , of their becoming hereafter her own .	26.611200547717164
Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have !	53.6924930213738
He did look at it and into it for half an hour , was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms , satisfied with what the owner said in its praise , and took it immediately .	26.999586407780132
It adds even another motive .	73.8044032870245
My good qualities are under your protection , and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible ;	32.047807119037124
Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable .	39.752084817259515
We can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough ;	53.06899481517794
too good for the waiter , is not it ?	94.50307785823155
but it had not been so in Derbyshire .	74.29058796769186
Elizabeth , to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this , heard it in silent indignation .	34.072872312294955
What sister would think herself at liberty to do it , unless there were something very objectionable ?	45.51412684892762
but no one looked more amused than Bennet himself , while his wife seriously commended Collins for having spoken so sensibly , and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas , that he was a remarkably clever , good kind of young man .	18.70928506342935
Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour , he had been able to get the better of himself .	33.79829673770515
The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident .	58.02580760068401
My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology .	37.91530648285992
You may depend upon it , Madam , said Miss Bingley , with cold civility , that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us .	19.300153133436282
They could have been understood only by her mother , who might have felt nearly the same .	37.0690957331694
I am sure I shall break mine , said Lydia .	31.080477904034396
His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary ;	32.892313389673966
What relates to yourself , is as follows .	79.69582955271457
dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter , which , in her ladyship's apprehension , peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance , in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew , which she had refused to give .	18.752339134987476
and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations .	24.266643961625984
I do not know .	78.70682147296458
To oblige you , I would try to believe almost any thing , but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this ;	28.752384415317525
There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them , for Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam , the younger son of his uncle , Lord and to the great surprise of all the party , when Collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him .	24.37064885486013
This is my advice .	132.60166087214944
There was also a postscript to this effect .	64.72325641720248
Though her manner varied however , her determination never did .	55.71638267893712
Good gracious !	216.59187369776393
It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day .	30.106369531791614
Yes , I have had a letter from him by express .	54.55072316959087
I am perfectly convinced by it that Darcy has no defect .	50.380655346987524
but when he went away , the whole family returned to their usual employments , and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration , for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden , or in reading and writing , and looking out of window in his own book room , which fronted the road .	17.546938832141212
Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments .	58.685020996105344
Dear madam , cried Hill , in great astonishment , don't you know there is an express come for master from Gardiner ?	34.527590024817215
Gardiner added in his letter , that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day , which was Saturday .	34.70551688401992
and your wit and vivacity I think must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite .	18.365648494739606
only three miles .	284.2777682808135
Kitty , who took all these threats in a serious light , began to cry .	35.06681297035276
Two of her girls had been on the point of marriage , and after all there was nothing in it .	33.50180260227696
I am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection .	31.156498947250544
I fancy she was wanted about the mince pies .	28.854053676755957
You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy .	24.91937373942481
for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him , I should only think worse of her understanding , than I now do of her heart .	33.73411847153094
A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music , singing , drawing , dancing , and the modern languages , to deserve the word ;	21.896225242126455
We acted with the best intentions .	83.75756262910046
and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room .	41.30731691901174
there was good humour and kindness .	99.57758687019285
Elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him ;	46.37576068978694
Let me hear from you very soon .	92.77320778035478
and Collins , being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader , was extremely well pleased to close his large book , and go .	21.43771353501993
How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love ?	44.2379868840586
I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me .	34.93188629896912
my dear Bennet , as she entered the room , we have had a most delightful evening , a most excellent ball .	31.81105031710123
cried Bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , if that disagreeable Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley !	31.62472383484084
But we are none of us consistent ;	58.55638789561049
Bennet , who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him , continued her triumph .	28.660290267803223
condolence , insufferable .	158.02195856273536
With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content ;	48.56768296552288
Not at all .	193.70708254992613
Let me congratulate you , on a very important conquest .	50.21782270421327
and you must feel , as well as I do , that the woman who marries him , cannot have a proper way of thinking .	28.455885550421367
but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply .	48.13562369885625
My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness , and I confess that I did not expect to receive more than my due .	24.232882502692274
though when the first tumult of joy was over , she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while .	26.637178523911896
Lizzy declares she will not have Collins , and Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy .	32.465301494432005
The journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane ;	46.14325009332848
All were struck with the stranger's air , all wondered who he could be , and Kitty and Lydia , determined if possible to find out , led the way across the street , under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop , and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot .	17.392336292601623
Bingley was quite uncomfortable ;	175.67535944304421
He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper ;	50.89452799081229
There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law .	22.657502202066695
But Gardiner could not be seen , and Darcy found , on further enquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning .	27.828716901673637
The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news , and telling again what had been already written ;	28.5358913687599
No ;	670.778131953586
I shall not go away , till you have given me the assurance I require .	40.12548287973289
but she checked herself .	88.70499494717615
Yet why did he come ?	144.21320593808196
and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls .	40.714580850142625
On the contrary every particular relative to his sister , was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself ;	33.40733407807141
If it be not so , let Darcy contradict it .	71.75578811872923
I guessed as much .	77.16368649687762
But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person ;	35.954448751929455
This is a parade , cried he , which does one good ;	51.11315646730617
My dear , replied her husband , I have two small favours to request .	35.85713482428136
cried he , turning towards her .	103.51642775037799
The walk being here less sheltered than on the other side , allowed them to see him before they met .	32.26003978152199
That among his own connections he was esteemed and valued that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling .	21.573052100724503
Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing ;	48.26968610744429
Lord !	639.3930496104806
They returned therefore in good spirits to Longbourn , the village where they lived , and of which they were the principal inhabitants .	34.85151805442039
But my father cannot .	152.07847798562983
if , indeed , such a report is in existence .	64.87098151977271
and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in his regimentals .	28.355629001007884
The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw .	58.503430550726534
As a child , she was affectionate and pleasing , and extremely fond of me ;	30.914442049646436
Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house , and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane .	23.518004921731247
Poor Reynolds , she was always very fond of me .	60.06257794505219
I have certainly meant well through the whole affair .	44.03392105304913
Calling back the servant , therefore , she commissioned him , though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible , to fetch his master and mistress home , instantly .	20.5125420170371
And this is always the way with him , she added .	67.80382819582341
I wish I could say , for the sake of her family , that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children , produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible , amiable , well-informed woman for the rest of her life ;	17.717423503281662
But my feelings are not only cordial towards him ;	55.34971596236261
It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together , and yet for the advantage of some , conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible .	21.44472703160419
After walking two or three times along that part of the lane , she was tempted , by the pleasantness of the morning , to stop at the gates and look into the park .	17.0348399373505
Upon my honour , I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life , as I have this evening ;	33.75405392761296
Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the next day , and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Wickham , and give him an invitation also , if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening .	24.176234301180656
Unfeeling , selfish girl !	130.06865088899602
Darcy is engaged to my daughter .	107.79378442876265
I was told , that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married , but that you , that Miss Elizabeth Bennet , would , in all likelihood , be soon afterwards united to my nephew , my own nephew , Darcy .	27.78321707547861
she cried .	402.14084133784803
They owed the restoration of Lydia , her character , every thing to him .	39.89149391581103
and she could no more bear that Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first vehemence of her disapprobation .	29.015254381285487
and could she have included Jane in the scheme , every part of it would have been perfect .	31.892976386236597
You know not what you are about .	95.61398155861824
And upon Elizabeth's seeming really , with vexed and embarrassed looks , about to escape , she added , Lizzy , I insist upon your staying and hearing Collins .	22.537549277332307
sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man .	27.858243666012022
Your list of the common extent of accomplishments , said Darcy , has too much truth .	30.93756793820203
E7 .	806.2902343264145
how he must have felt it !	157.05025463059084
Not at all , he replied ;	123.61352114976188
But Jane knows , as well as I do , what Wickham really is .	46.64512694275145
To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire , when that conviction had been given , was scarcely the work of a moment .	34.7109874933854
La !	561.1845026368452
Of what he has particularly accused me I am ignorant ;	52.617348295992464
And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit ;	47.341750340148906
Its banks were neither formal , nor falsely adorned .	44.34168218565856
As for Elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia , that she considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter ;	25.431418400469287
It is unlucky , said she , after a short pause , that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country .	23.26268438066354
Not as you represent it .	120.96927239942451
I told you the other day , of his infamous behaviour to Darcy ;	43.24722421795414
And what is fifty miles of good road ?	58.138062922398305
till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk , she made some slight observation on the dance .	27.61584855121015
the compliment must be all for herself .	123.85918476788827
The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected .	61.90426193461003
I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out , if possible , from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment , whether Wickham has any relations or connections , who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself .	19.28430123319224
Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay , for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other .	24.131383152046375
You know not , you can scarcely conceive , how they have tortured me ;	50.28326313893733
A flirt too , in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation ;	31.428397045882647
and if I was her , I would not have put up with it .	41.02875558903192
They were confined for the evening at different tables , and she had nothing to hope , but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room , as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself .	21.0141540558079
PRIDE PREJUDICE .	302.43899345427184
I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters , and beg leave to apologise for it , as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends , but of this hereafter .	17.9932540439149
but though Jane would have defended either or both , had they appeared to be wrong , she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister .	25.21595970310795
and affectionately taking her hand , said in reply , Do not make yourself uneasy , my love .	26.046932158686968
For heaven's sake , madam , speak lower .	41.11240906717231
when her father continued , You look conscious .	107.41231585799885
When I last saw her , she was not very promising .	54.884132395708264
They are wanted in the farm , Bennet , are not they ?	40.970601539346674
Elizabeth listened , wondered , doubted , and was impatient for more .	44.069999604435345
The part which I acted , is now to be explained .	52.499287204567615
Elizabeth longed to observe that Bingley had been a most delightful friend ;	41.763117274250064
How merry we shall be together when we meet !	56.45448557926036
When this was done , she had a less active part to play .	55.751245494848575
Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression .	141.60212728973994
She could think only of her letter .	78.43587812153059
but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger .	31.88968632240518
His own father did not long survive mine , and within half a year from these events , Wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally resolved against taking orders , he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be benefited .	19.092497393430207
I do not remember her name among the ladies at court .	37.131258852931715
and as Dawson does not object to the Barouche box , there will be very good room for one of you and indeed , if the weather should happen to be cool , I should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you large .	18.295503016053654
but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ;	43.42246757287758
That would be a good scheme , said Elizabeth , if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home .	31.13585169294857
though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Bingley in consequence of it , before they did .	38.46505342502997
This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared ;	47.42865600383616
Not that I am afraid of myself , but I dread other people's remarks .	30.87152220821657
for give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained .	19.924247390608727
And so , is it quite certain he is coming ?	89.00800682264057
London : Printed for T Egerton , Military Library , Whitehall .	21.655013287918294
Things are settled so oddly .	94.11377870084235
If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity .	21.511456715847714
It was greatly my wish that he should do so , he added , as soon as his marriage was fixed on .	29.612938654728687
You cannot be too much on your guard .	56.333512200605796
I have said no such thing .	78.27886198155326
and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf , is natural and amiable .	30.425724404762203
But it is not merely this affair , she continued , on which my dislike is founded .	33.52010685662378
She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind ;	42.841152801609255
and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment .	36.63414848328872
But I make no doubt , they often talk of it between themselves .	39.01161259647497
and before she could strike into another path , she was overtaken by Wickham .	24.324011288900078
and sometimes did venture a short sentence , when there was least danger of its being heard .	32.42679782867128
I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ?	25.53676191506374
and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement , without the intention of marriage , she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey .	18.659017759611757
As that was the case , neither Jane , to whom I related the whole , nor I , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public ;	36.228314575020455
After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject , Bennet coolly observed , From all that I can collect by your manner of talking , you must be two of the silliest girls in the country .	21.88969793074714
They are in the same profession , you know ;	61.78775536827651
And I have another favour to ask .	81.36686774591738
She had not been many hours at home , before she found that the Brighton scheme , of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn , was under frequent discussion between her parents .	24.485586571359853
Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton , where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the King , during his mayoralty .	18.241230557864554
Anxiety on Jane's behalf , was another prevailing concern , and Darcy's explanation , by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion , heightened the sense of what Jane had lost .	25.230073093877312
But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends , will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ?	20.323779090390154
The other is Miss De Bourgh .	60.023311243046095
how rich and how great you will be !	95.20419262112898
And have you heard from him often ?	111.23572471642198
In the absence of Jane , he always attached himself to Elizabeth , for the pleasure of talking of her ;	29.918249910976204
What am I to do ?	172.0915875783146
Engraved for No .	220.94502945376092
Elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint , being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply .	26.2355800001635
That they might have met without ill consequence , is perhaps probable ;	55.350266135360926
But I can guess how it was ;	58.76683671494889
But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else .	27.92486214612999
but neither that , nor any thing else , awakened a suspicion of the truth .	34.91075521027569
I hope there was .	98.54090758661259
1 .	384.9991185797929
But , if I were you , I would stand by the nephew .	45.30155423803503
Darcy walked off ;	237.03304231840153
The officer was the very Denny , concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire , and he bowed as they passed .	26.586278030429213
But here , she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character , for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness , and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet .	17.000109905167186
Had Lydia's marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms , it was not to be supposed that Darcy would connect himself with a family , where to every other objection would now be added , an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned .	19.893090307707418
No , no , let me shift for myself ;	57.052435472602255
I am impatient to see him .	47.51577924879674
The carriage was sent to meet them at , and they were to return in it , by dinner-time .	37.627465900884836
For forty years , he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support .	21.2598941991852
but Elizabeth heard not a word , and , wholly engrossed by her own feelings , followed them in silence .	30.14582400101631
hang Kitty !	351.4121406321345
And my mother How is she ?	114.74631655670737
From his garden , Collins would have led them round his two meadows , but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost , turned back ;	25.468007562473726
She is happy , then , said her father , drily ;	38.94104258942169
I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing !	47.38799023670265
I wonder when you would have spoken , if I had not asked you !	38.83054952079099
Jane looked well , and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits , amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them .	24.33720008240367
She is almost three and twenty !	88.52282970177724
I must ask whether you were surprised ?	69.89468599090146
She listened most attentively to all that passed between them , and gloried in every expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , his taste , or his good manners .	24.74870278563719
But we are all liable to error .	48.03944163375339
Elizabeth could not but look surprised .	80.27681557416136
Bingley , from this time , was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn ;	54.408642737732286
Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him .	64.79284027276333
Younger sons cannot marry where they like .	65.20583497696464
I believe him to be Lady Catherine's nephew .	49.416229572686596
This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence , and the little value he put on his own good qualities .	28.923944382096522
and after stating her imprudence , I am happy to add , that I owed the knowledge of it to herself .	24.960297133576848
In future , I hope we shall be always of one mind .	56.58535578065066
I hope , my dear , said Bennet to his wife , as they were at breakfast the next morning , that you have ordered a good dinner to-day , because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party .	19.457365187529106
his friend had given him the earliest information of it .	75.8809185206261
But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration , and gave most gracious smiles , especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them .	20.145164578585778
Mary , said she , I wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun !	48.6971499875262
Steady to his purpose , he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday , and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour , he adhered most conscientiously to his book , and would not even look at her .	20.96259145637812
let us hear all the particulars , not forgetting their comparative height and size ;	36.457645252519974
My child , let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life .	27.055883871420868
I am sure I sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night .	19.548726033141488
Elizabeth's collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ;	46.95282736742918
but it pleased her .	124.52161418935674
It became her turn to listen .	90.05932392214321
Lady Catherine was generally speaking stating the mistakes of the three others , or relating some anecdote of herself .	24.095893285029053
At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress , and at half past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner .	27.579623463902905
and instantly embracing her , acknowledged , with the liveliest emotion , that she was the happiest creature in the world .	19.99506777372726
He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man , upon my word ;	27.707604932133915
Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year ?	50.60519986432733
but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood , I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger .	29.884229668356365
And who knows what may happen ?	86.2306766965784
They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter , will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others , for who , as lady Catherine herself condescendingly says , will connect themselves with such a family .	19.311733390601045
You have withheld the advantages , which you must know to have been designed for him .	34.0132271453011
If he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , I shall soon cease to regret him at all .	21.065474319176055
but I think I may defy even your sagacity , to discover the name of your admirer .	31.416080407195867
He now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before ;	21.172349673086593
and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted , which , in her anxious interpretation , denoted a recollection of Jane , not untinctured by tenderness , and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her , had he dared .	17.994257125210872
Collins's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete .	64.55662666158113
I do not know what to say to you .	51.14178601322263

After tea , Bennet retired to the library , as was his custom , and Mary went up stairs to her instrument .	30.45792218455758
You must give me leave to judge for myself , and pay me the compliment of believing what I say .	27.616689079889433
- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works .	23.19586290764965
Our poor mother is sadly grieved .	86.20165299043927
Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through Longbourn-house .	31.834185118556015
and as it had been asked without the least suspicion , she was not distressed by his repeating it .	29.182460539821374
and I could wish , Miss Bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either .	21.69904155645763
Whenever Charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ;	35.10432077866929
But , my dear , you must indeed go and see Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood .	33.91808598147157
Elizabeth was distressed .	133.59634798833665
or me either , for that matter .	124.9494506780969
Haggerston has our directions , and all will be completed in a week .	41.39029122227952
and as she was no horse-woman , walking was her only alternative .	39.342687714414396
Her coming there was the most unfortunate , the most ill-judged thing in the world !	45.69045777547168
and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with , though she could not be in such raptures as Collins expected the scene to inspire , and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house , and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis De Bourgh .	15.208870602961547
The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady , to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable ;	20.785427220649076
Darcy drew his chair a little towards her , and said , You cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment .	30.53183664220635
His being such a charming young man , and so rich , and living but three miles from them , were the first points of self-gratulation ;	24.60561732336603
Let me do it without farther loss of time .	58.087205607567306
sensible that if such an idea had been suggested , his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it .	26.88899303834417
My dear aunt , how could you think of it ?	58.69128127660648
Lady Catherine , I believe , did a great deal to it when Collins first came to Hunsford .	36.822903026935556
I began to be afraid you would never come back again .	34.86350520364807
What could become of Bingley and Jane !	99.42412328733836
I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me , but if the same circumstances were to happen again , I am sure I should be deceived again .	18.56975022285515
said her mother .	272.9676011446398
good or bad ?	349.61402434577803
They were in street .	107.43979366354885
It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat , and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour .	21.96706061798981
Darcy had been at her sister's wedding .	94.4715656143168
Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme ;	40.827421657725786
her husband looked impenetrably grave ;	126.69621753644391
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind , as was here collected in one individual .	22.128566063329306
Such as vanity and pride .	141.29702380048258
Miss Lydia is going to be married ;	94.4239325715847
for Bennet , having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase , than she entered the breakfast-room , and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection .	15.972125285438343
Thank Heaven !	252.35407186726488
We have certainly done our best ;	102.78588530247282
Wickham began the subject himself .	156.00200842861142
Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day , and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation , c .	22.517570562383032
and for the first evening she was his settled choice .	51.65720485706799
Elizabeth was excessively disappointed ;	100.10030858941319
If your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless , you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ;	28.051034586698155
The easy assurance of the young couple , indeed , was enough to provoke him .	27.683783771595756
She followed him thither ;	93.3001865079652
He meant to resign his commission immediately ;	43.20108148063827
Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared , Darcy was continually giving offence .	40.248439309534625
that he is to take possession before Michaelmas , and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week .	27.320239482663258
Nor did he seem much more at ease ;	77.19845304875659
Why was he to be the judge ?	120.72916571814874
But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge ?	38.66842988786261
Hurst and Bingley were at piquet , and Hurst was observing their game .	40.9076647184733
I must beg , therefore , to be importuned no farther on the subject .	29.425760132727664
As the weather was fine , they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park .	32.632288427128096
Then shewing her purchases : Look here , I have bought this bonnet .	28.99994443016562
and so did Forster .	123.46553192970005
I never saw a more promising inclination .	61.99143857176515
Every girl in , or near Meryton , was out of her senses about him for the first two months ;	39.789663344957646
and pray what is the result ?	75.56381813639541
Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter , and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Bingley himself , instead of a ceremonious card .	21.653644148706892
My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents .	25.433145610459363
Perhaps that is not possible for any one .	97.34771189963243
It was a painful , but not an improbable , conjecture .	42.09621854097702
My mother was taken ill immediately , and the whole house in such confusion !	41.881901693281876
To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered , but the state of indecision in which she remained , as to the extent of what she should communicate ;	16.527008598464633
And you are never to stir out of doors , till you can prove , that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner .	27.554824754880638
He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from that , I am inclined to hope , he might have been misunderstood before .	23.239127185850524
and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop , or Lady Catherine de Bourgh , by venturing to dance .	14.844626636520344
Do you think it incredible that Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ?	22.131125218793727
but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side , I hope it will not be long before they are .	24.241086562698857
Elizabeth was pleased to find , that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend , for , though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world , she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him .	21.45205883000409
But who could have foreseen such an attention as this ?	54.17222279176777
and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin's affairs , and whose character she had no reason to question .	19.384769989309767
Compliments always take you by surprise , and me never .	70.90045816617858
or under what misrepresentation , can you here impose upon others ?	55.11191766556645
My feelings in every respect forbid it .	73.41224449264999
The families who had been in town for the winter came back again , and summer finery and summer engagements arose .	21.444535352846852
I could not bear to have her ten miles from me ;	41.76637815367774
Such were the gentle murmurs of Bennet , and they gave way only to the greater distress of Bingley's continued absence .	29.943440732834716
Jane was so admired , nothing could be like it .	69.50830872960988
their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ;	59.124943630145665
You ought all to have learned .	92.99882707944154
yes , said Elizabeth drily Darcy is uncommonly kind to Bingley , and takes a prodigious deal of care of him .	23.069946988674975
If it be so , if I have been misled by such error , to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable .	28.097830160915272
I am a gentleman's daughter ;	67.02121235467305
But I confess they would have no charms for me .	44.00019563024707
That is my idea of good breeding ;	67.35212873345144
but , to be sure , it would have been such a thing for me !	40.02741056519212
But I am willing to hope the best , and that his character has been misunderstood .	33.257055379262724
But their father , though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure , was really glad to see them ;	30.64153550346332
To be sure , Lizzy , said her aunt , he is not so handsome as Wickham ;	38.30875636650484
Wickham so very bad !	236.36097516684544
She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire , and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister , in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter .	22.01567536352246
Every thing was too recent for gaiety , but the evening passed tranquilly away ;	40.09852217137905
and yet , it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham .	28.82286216224673
Most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote .	40.86567186339257
He was on one side of her mother .	63.961351264509716
He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given me .	23.39676126225111
Collins must excuse me .	160.6342671475196
I wish you very happy and very rich , and by refusing your hand , do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise .	31.40699858913451
but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing .	52.98530007447017
Bennet made no answer .	125.23410640284976
The hill , crowned with wood , from which they had descended , receiving increased abruptness from the distance , was a beautiful object .	18.938725084864238
She was humbled , she was grieved ;	53.97737266696692
He who , she had been persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest enemy , seemed , on this accidental meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance , and without any indelicate display of regard , or any peculiarity of manner , where their two selves only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister .	17.843611580692883
Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received , in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense .	27.146091101065565
By the Author of Sense and Sensibility .	44.044388545198956
These are heavy misfortunes , replied Elizabeth .	64.71741513759243
and I assure you , I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement .	26.81768843854855
I felt nothing but surprise .	85.56396899314824
Did he know of their intending to go off ?	81.06407671785509
Give my love to Colonel Forster , I hope you will drink to our good journey .	39.89509392042525
Lady Catherine has been of infinite use , which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use .	26.171683883136186
Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers' names and connections .	37.58536524439303
That she should have walked three miles so early in the day , in such dirty weather , and by herself , was almost incredible to Hurst and Miss Bingley ;	24.433805835119223
she continued to declare that she would , and the argument ended only with the visit .	38.486246074689056
for else they will be destitute enough .	62.035498210070216
We were married , you know , at Clement's , because Wickham's lodgings were in that parish .	41.99955696967628
A great deal more passed at the other table .	59.27153244492678
They descended the hill , crossed the bridge , and drove to the door ;	24.797120506354982
But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her , so soon after this event .	34.6921733259258
The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte's situation , and his expectation of a young olive-branch .	30.170142636914743
I never thought Darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do .	29.57971785996319
The children , two girls of six and eight years old , and two younger boys , were to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane , who was the general favourite , and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way teaching them , playing with them , and loving them .	16.8565407937509
He arranges the business just as he pleases .	45.27728000720764
I have a warm , unguarded temper , and I may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him , and to him , too freely .	23.387264254696014
Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth .	56.59363492421816
and had I been the rector of Longbourn , I should very strenuously have opposed it .	32.52305064247996
A little sea-bathing would set me up for ever .	52.51485320036163
a most convenient distance for the young ladies , who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week , to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner's shop just over the way .	25.714326425329244
Oh !	298.0706733468098
Elizabeth would not observe her ;	93.27715858744737
After sitting a few minutes , they were all sent to one of the windows , to admire the view , Collins attending them to point out its beauties , and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer .	18.048382318409015
The others then joined her , and expressed their admiration of his figure ;	35.54759332579534
I wish I could hear that you , my dearest friend , had any intention of making one in the croud , but of that I despair .	27.718364700710957
We will go as far as Meryton with you , said Catherine and Lydia .	48.70322578741429
I hope they will not meet at all .	55.33954214777602
Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom , which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family .	26.330151698631425
Collins knew not what to make of him .	102.59228372156826
One came from her books , and the other from her toilette .	47.83694015389741
Very well .	280.41673424364103
She could not determine how her mother would take it ;	51.60568836618163
And have you answered the letter ?	127.77556865702988
Pemberley was now Georgiana's home ;	143.59300447230257
I am very sensible , madam , of the hardship to my fair cousins , and could say much on the subject , but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate .	18.533424514136026
my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ?	22.38615064628883
Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House , whichever it might be , where Darcy then was .	34.05824068225074
Gracechurch-street , Sept .	152.3176691819723
All connection between us seemed now dissolved .	71.59520002191776
He keeps a man-servant , does he ?	58.15557187724969
It was lady Catherine de Bourgh .	39.402373693029034
She is so fond of Forster , said she , it will be quite shocking to send her away !	32.99188195406809
my dear Charlotte , impossible !	125.62378543713626
and I doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself , Darcy .	28.24004354828888
CHAPTER XIX .	223.11563766813362
and after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family .	31.344796048816193
What will be his surprise , thought she , when he knows who they are !	45.72565317224589
For a few moments , indeed , she felt that he would probably strike into some other path .	31.322629547117636
He was angry .	151.67747399338995
A man who has once been refused !	79.01238050101053
most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman's education .	26.003950806294537
Upon my word , said Gardiner , I begin to be of your uncle's opinion .	35.20272641544569
She had no fear of its spreading farther , through his means .	37.0791865934545
Nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination , said Elizabeth .	52.81303979964114
Do you draw ?	152.69964104931987
You go to Brighton !	121.47524128664898
and the others were to meet us at the church .	56.76178608585308
No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you , can think any thing wanting .	41.81910004247815
He added , that Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present , to leave London , and promised to write again very soon .	28.386436490552025
How I long to see her !	108.60467314225448
Elizabeth made no answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Darcy , and reading in her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it .	15.936425772003037
Miss Bingley saw , or suspected enough to be jealous ;	43.20091817785468
and , though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy's father , five years before , it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends , than she had been in the way of procuring .	19.798323995058265
The business of her life was to get her daughters married ;	66.4084221448782
Darcy took her advice , and did finish his letter .	46.53178137465015
Bingley was good looking and gentleman-like ;	102.29896010313895
Had not my own feelings decided against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man , who has been the means of ruining , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ?	27.24929252334011
if I should ever go to Brighton , I would behave better than Lydia .	47.93556401609198
It is I believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world .	26.42284932347739
She felt it so ;	153.50667846583897
and when Bennet joined them at supper , his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was .	31.32475320722409
Elizabeth felt Jane's pleasure .	128.2663301943053
Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal , and felt persuaded of her sister's ready acquiescence .	31.13103673396887
But I will no longer importune my young cousin .	42.72264704218077
Then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce Bingley to her .	34.03419122815634
That he was really fond of Jane , she doubted no more than she had ever done ;	32.022494438469685
At present , however , I consider myself as quite fixed here .	40.01423932304384
a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification ;	53.8988707259836
Mary and Kitty were both with Bennet : one communication would , therefore , do for all .	55.08710238450962
unless when some barbarous neighbour , who could not be enough detested , had given him an invitation to dinner , which he thought himself obliged to accept .	27.4172835628899
Had she not seen him in Derbyshire , she might have supposed him capable of coming there , with no other view than what was acknowledged ;	35.55427916584327
She dreaded seeing Wickham again , and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible .	35.45709085941585
How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton !	55.72318771241162
why did she come ?	205.32652028192766
Darcy was writing , and Miss Bingley , seated near him , was watching the progress of his letter , and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister .	20.61480017749478
Why did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight ?	47.8329235518165
They must be a great loss to your family .	64.73436516635006
And on the gentlemen's approaching , one of the girls moved closer to her than ever , and said , in a whisper , The men shan't come and part us , I am determined .	20.152373216906216
and it was not till Easter-day , almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival , that they were honoured by such an attention , and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening .	21.7684496237474
Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room , and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless .	23.511239956373913
( by the bye , Forster and me are such friends ) and so she asked the two Harringtons to come , but Harriet was ill , and so Pen was forced to come by herself ;	27.748131671374548
The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow .	22.323036520542377
At first there seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely , for she was a most determined talker ;	35.13701208711099
They were of a respectable family in the north of England ;	39.702862054629364
though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy .	62.210249192316454
Bennet was not in the habit of walking , Mary could never spare time , but the remaining five set off together .	26.508138620284125
Accordingly , when she retired at night , she asked the chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place , what was the name of its proprietor , and with no little alarm , whether the family were down for the summer .	25.041076995544156
But if you will listen to his letter , you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself .	27.622997410491017
She is a very headstrong foolish girl , and does not know her own interest ;	26.873184531805688
I had often seen him in love before .	64.89713605972315
Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion , sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation .	26.55623507663494
consequently that she is aunt to the present Darcy .	87.30926118638806
Miss Bingley did the same ;	136.2944925310532
Elizabeth did all she could , to shield him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification ;	23.348856626357634
In that county , there was enough to be seen , to occupy the chief of their three weeks ;	28.068473072411084
You and papa , and my sisters , must come down and see us .	48.79782693379691
but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley , she dropt all her resentment ;	26.112648909057697
for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire , and of his being gone into the regulars .	35.74531029415212
The motive professed , was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known , as to make it impossible for any young woman of character , to love or confide in him .	23.549730922277334
If he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare , he determined to make enquiries there , and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach .	20.990492102909954

I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say .	23.648684783437044
I do not trust my own partiality .	49.937750731381534
Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits .	34.55414408815981
In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her a present from my master ;	41.11758331126493
And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock .	44.74481351095144
You cannot be more than twenty , I am sure , therefore you need not conceal your age .	27.422831094305383
and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment .	23.75507798550127

But if you have got them to-day , said Elizabeth , my mother's purpose will be answered .	29.142348444425778
And when I returned home , the shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time .	38.465314467182935
I could not have parted with you , my Lizzy , to any one less worthy .	32.1762180673256
and he and Bennet spent the morning together , as had been agreed on .	44.27065453174234
made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow's debts , and got him his commission !	34.756815100162804
You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works , reports , performances and research .	17.305691856492494
On entering the room , he seemed to hesitate ;	51.37548592511496
I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it .	34.23798464114062
Sometime hence it will be all found out , and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before .	27.45002243291489
or had you intended any more serious consequence ?	119.52756139496461
I am trying to make it out .	47.16103150131162
I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet , she is really a very sweet girl , and I wish with all my heart she were well settled .	26.894590192168295
I am not one and twenty .	71.75753291865162
Will it not be advisable , before we proceed on this subject , to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request , as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties ?	20.365228229417937
I am afraid you do not like your pen .	36.54313545386085
Then , after a short silence , he continued , Lizzy , I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May , which , considering the event , shews some greatness of mind .	23.14840941805833
It was as follows : MY DEAR SIR , I feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire .	17.06883956403042
Her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved .	68.33011777462976
I admire all my three sons-in-law highly , said he .	41.99704535341932
I should be sorry indeed , if it were .	54.80254440008102
Darcy made no answer .	123.03951883629804
Darcy , you cannot deny the fact .	90.16278510800936
and within five miles of Lambton , Elizabeth found from her aunt , that Pemberley was situated .	29.329460671601886
I have never heard him say so ;	67.64663968055552
and his answering immediately to the last question Oh !	43.894863648824234
Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness , and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover , she could not prevent its frequently recurring .	19.256052506498552
Darcy mentioned his letter .	162.46929133216375
Kitty , to her very material advantage , spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters .	32.68418070243483
but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away , just as they were all getting so intimate together .	18.448266386265768
But I tell you what , Miss Lizzy , if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at all and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead .	21.176966415804483
I will not be interrupted .	75.8010869371041
I desire you will do no such thing .	55.52825270600652
Elizabeth did not know what to make of it .	58.48540391652869
Elizabeth said nothing , but it gratified her exceedingly ;	70.71541372209276
I will answer for it he never cared three straws about her .	39.408462071878986
I am grieved , indeed , cried Darcy ;	48.087475596979786
And now here's Bennet gone away , and I know he will fight Wickham , wherever he meets him , and then he will be killed , and what is to become of us all ?	20.080540357584535
Gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her .	39.877889994340144
Yes if Darcy does not put it off again .	60.730120096344926
but it would not do ;	107.88442717978234
Since the shire were first quartered in Meryton , nothing but love , flirtation , and officers , have been in her head .	26.752513820725422
and , after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt , her resentment gave way , either to her affection for him , or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself ;	20.78282395238698
I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing .	39.57915917334152
I have been making the tour of the Park , he replied , as I generally do every year , and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage .	20.02066813798849
Perhaps he thought her too young .	144.7621802903435
The fishing scheme had been renewed the day before , and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon .	21.91555750623753
I am not so selfish , however , as to press for it , if inconvenient .	27.974906889422765
I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself .	46.97327729011331
What he told me was merely this ;	96.46290541232369
To Elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ;	25.151825486175763
Hill began instantly to express her joy .	84.15529723987402
but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes , and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt .	20.080458296610264
Indeed !	936.2050528584315
There is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King .	47.517184549553036
Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish ;	53.18836460576203
My dear Lizzy , do not give way to such feelings as these .	38.787879645802875
in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of every thing , she was still dear to him .	37.429929275041836
The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's match , which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true !	17.64537677878058
A military life is not what I was intended for , but circumstances have now made it eligible .	41.73002194106352
And , besides , no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road .	33.98191171235313
She was roused from her seat , and her reflections , by some one's approach ;	32.05139843853629
She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken .	40.209505002555
it is of no consequence .	173.05824507892177
Elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion , that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Bingley's invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's amusement ;	17.999724995076235
In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty ;	35.88871775721195
A most delightful place !	176.75862799469806
To Kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected .	38.265171274925585
We may compare our different opinions .	71.02294838925633
This will never do .	185.59462507008482
the door was then allowed to be shut , and the carriage drove off .	41.69373264890949
such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her , and she began her song .	32.39491388799481
Lydia gaped as he opened the volume , and before he had , with very monotonous solemnity , read three pages , she interrupted him with , Do you know , mama , that my uncle Philips talks of turning away Richard , and if he does , Colonel Forster will hire him .	17.270691945002163
CHAPTER XVIII .	234.75576465601785
You know nothing of the matter .	73.81062327069219
Sir William did not say much .	79.7171979281268
She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico , muslin , and cambric , and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders , had not Jane , though with some difficulty , persuaded her to wait , till her father was at leisure to be consulted .	18.055760028847075
but , had she still felt any , it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself , on seeing her again .	30.230866672937225
He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance , and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption ;	28.99849643173573
Insolent girl !	304.62306134022333
but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful .	39.070847220579125
While she spoke , Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words , or to distrust their meaning .	33.54289034016754
and when she had gone through the whole letter , though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two , put it hastily away , protesting that she would not regard it , that she would never look in it again .	18.519073647239306
Oh !	298.0706733468098
Painful recollections will intrude , which cannot , which ought not to be repelled .	34.14193693937444
Allowing for the common demands of the game , Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth , and she was very willing to hear him , though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told , the history of his acquaintance with Darcy .	20.74387461625486
He cannot know what Darcy is .	97.47411935811249
With the officers !	300.1299927763187
Charlotte says , she hardly ever does .	108.74596560182039
Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below .	37.25759381608029
I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady .	38.953381777513144
and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love .	34.51605535218162
Oh , yes !	155.41443917661368
You have deprived the best years of his life , of that independence which was no less his due than his desert .	31.845152468716382
No , no I feel he may defy us there .	71.37130033488768
It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy .	43.401058707016425
untamed , unabashed , wild , noisy , and fearless .	31.238339990781036
You look pale .	149.32613289366233
but , whenever she did catch a glimpse , she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said , she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed , however temporary its existence might prove , had at least outlived one day .	16.507886148054666
but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly .	21.624540176802917
If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew , I shall certainly not be kept from it , by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss De Bourgh .	26.47626726273629
but it is to the credit of his modesty .	49.29544757432631
He was at the same time haughty , reserved , and fastidious , and his manners , though well bred , were not inviting .	24.175660830800123
re-considering events , determining probabilities , and reconciling herself as well as she could , to a change so sudden and so important , fatigue , and a recollection of her long absence , made her at length return home ;	19.26861210645741
The evening conversation , when they were all assembled , had lost much of its animation , and almost all its sense , by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth .	27.84424396067575
CHAPTER II .	223.11563766813362
Can there be any other opinion on the subject ?	90.89065141578796
he will immediately comprehend what I must feel , and I rely upon his goodness .	39.58017625376491
Lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath ;	45.77389766899142
Depend upon it , my dear , that when there are twenty , I will visit them all .	36.333734065449086
She was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger , and wondered it had escaped her before .	23.13932370948183
It is highly improper .	74.16837405433195
He leaves out half his words , and blots the rest .	30.72850707265896
To complete the favourable impression , she then told him what Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia .	39.66671337900311
and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to , a wish of being better acquainted with them , was expressed towards the two eldest .	26.595696325352623
Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring ?	56.658291599712264
She looks sickly and cross .	68.35264196765658
Upon my word , Caroline , I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by imitation .	30.467023476752722
Who should suffer but myself ?	168.02099863017756
Your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach , that the contentment arising from them , is not of philosophy , but what is much better , of ignorance .	23.703603727994924
My father and mother knew nothing of that , they only felt how imprudent a match it must be .	42.16917994460671
I had much rather go in the coach .	53.18128609382747
The adieu is charity itself .	50.437379885323466
I am truly glad , dearest Lizzy , that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes ;	22.28982784349275
Collins , did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe's calling yesterday to thank me ?	42.22536467086764
He is now perhaps sorry for what he has done , and anxious to re-establish a character .	27.507262155474866
and if , as you were mounting your horse , a friend were to say , 'Bingley , you had better stay till next week , ' you would probably do it , you would probably not go and , at another word , might stay a month .	28.28507241796932
I have heard from authority , which I thought as good , that it was left you conditionally only , and at the will of the present patron .	27.499524901965806
Collins was eloquent in her praise .	86.28173287559032
but Elizabeth saw , with admiration of his taste , that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine ;	27.242873484942933
Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room ;	43.876163406244395
As they walked across the lawn towards the river , Elizabeth turned back to look again ;	37.63937502773639
Oh , Lord !	141.70873064320966
Well , Jane , make haste and tell us ;	53.099949246354
If you believed it impossible to be true , said Elizabeth , colouring with astonishment and disdain , I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far .	24.641028847392594
I know you do ;	141.04037051949933
In confirmation of this , she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected , without actually naming her authority , but stating it to be such as might be relied on .	18.823191409456374
Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town ;	35.6368522735748
They were all astonished ;	123.1377196582712
I cannot believe it .	94.45166483033995
adding , with a significant smile , I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here .	24.451235896804903
He answered her in the same style , and the subject dropped .	40.249966624342356
I would not be so fastidious as you are , cried Bingley , for a kingdom !	33.6586403988663
Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ;	77.57465437118972
Indeed I am .	199.50953430287092
Your profusion makes me saving ;	74.9938164101206
She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of ill humour , which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her .	16.609381952374438
Oh !	298.0706733468098
She is a very fine-looking woman !	56.81372987306951
and there was no necessity for such attention .	60.638574770104924
I was sometimes quite provoked , but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane , and for their sakes had patience with her .	26.33967451896201
Are you so severe upon your own sex , as to doubt the possibility of all this ?	33.5895972193078
but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham ;	40.207310613589726
and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you .	23.806116541459502
That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment , as to refuse his daughter a privilege , without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid , exceeded all that she could believe possible .	20.74696203984855
It must not be thought of .	90.86485482913145
Oh , Jane , had we been less secret , had we told what we knew of him , this could not have happened !	35.09154494737101
Our instrument is a capital one , probably superior to You shall try it some day .	33.08160364586523
You thought the waiter must not hear , as if he cared !	51.24149885696818
said Elizabeth to herself .	199.81491532703362
He protested that except Lady Catherine and her daughter , he had never seen a more elegant woman ;	29.57999059615338
He was her dear Wickham on every occasion ;	79.91329950219279
You must contrive to send somebody .	67.66308484335205
Let me never see either one or the other again !	68.62957818416852
But why Darcy came so often to the Parsonage , it was more difficult to understand .	39.60250813807452
Oh !	298.0706733468098
It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Darcy himself ;	41.34504523370525
There is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair , on which I do not reflect with satisfaction ;	27.772654856881065
A great many indeed , said her companion with a sigh .	45.39500336728025
Yes , my youngest is not sixteen .	69.11424779226843
Yes , Sir , I know I am .	60.4900036941182
She tried , however , to compose herself to answer him with patience , when he should have done .	31.77616214706812
Sir William staid only a week at Hunsford ;	63.49401109492049
The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him .	35.67983320083676
his brow contracted , his air gloomy .	76.62372999643614
Only let me assure you , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage .	25.210729677896506
Every thing nourishes what is strong already .	61.562256234182385
how I laughed !	258.80867790455665
but you must lend us the money , for we have just spent ours at the shop out there .	29.353021046987184
His friend had left him that morning for London , but was to return home in ten days time .	48.16045553653893
When Bennet arrived , he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure .	30.83328640689429
I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character , in a part of the world , where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit .	19.47124327306275
But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham .	46.13534512194298
Darcy had walked away to another part of the room .	52.37902244966849
Was not this some excuse for incivility , if I was uncivil ?	49.86311650205025
Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father , who had intended to purchase an estate , but did not live to do it .	19.754500459158322
that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that one false step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful , and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex .	17.544011652289413
Our importance , our respectability in the world , must be affected by the wild volatility , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia's character .	20.752991880695685
I have found out , said he , by a singular accident , that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness .	24.602186166183248
My dearest sister , now be be serious .	76.66712074203711
but Charlotte , she soon found , was depending on the plan , and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty .	21.105828026455857
to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where , and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with .	36.736559209666915
Their mutual affection will steady them ;	89.15544360720764
He came , and in such very good time , that the ladies were none of them dressed .	37.41567025608064
and certainly ought not to have appeared ;	66.63908275308944
and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , I have not yet learnt to condemn them .	25.249279456823437
But , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes time , and then we all set out .	29.505891170478463
and if the second , I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire .	37.33910598301663
Yes , she called yesterday with her father .	63.523097052286914
It is from Miss Bingley , said Jane , and then read it aloud .	32.770674962796285
My poor father !	210.36536370192547
Elizabeth instantly read her feelings , and at that moment solicitude for Wickham , resentment against his enemies , and every thing else gave way before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness .	20.686945603951212
A thousand things may arise in six months !	59.950476033200175
We do not suffer by accident .	74.91601135436669
and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters , in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about .	19.36904534127568
Your's , c .	131.1823014200323
Elizabeth almost stared at her .	83.01960521833507
Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time , but Darcy they had only seen at church .	30.50529399519064
Gracechurch-street , Monday , August 2 .	51.26004119750401
but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me .	38.2130933187179
and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia's flight , on her own folly alone .	23.808421405908003
She was received , however , very politely by them ;	44.07215027993803
You must not be too severe upon yourself , replied Elizabeth .	41.57080551555875
The country , said Darcy , can in general supply but few subjects for such a study .	31.870768133013705
She had only to say in reply , that they had wandered about , till she was beyond her own knowledge .	32.12719591239218
His pride , in that direction , may be of service , if not to himself , to many others , for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by .	26.492916705439292
I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation , replied Elizabeth , but it is not in my power to accept it .	24.517388569234775
But he found , in reply to this question , that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country .	32.905632528862625
Pride , observed Mary , who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections , is a very common failing I believe .	27.624316311645174
My friend has an excellent understanding though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Collins as the wisest thing she ever did .	28.824479729134847
This was not very consoling to Bennet , and , therefore , instead of making any answer , she went on as before , I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate .	24.362636967932406
in which case you may be sure of my pardon .	76.23160802765297
the windows are full west .	118.21942572831547
neither did the apothecary , who arrived about the same time , think it at all advisable .	36.0389317396946
The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this .	32.73957384936124
Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls , and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him .	25.345894968227054
You deserve no such attention .	89.82764865724714
for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend's dislike would vanish , if she could suppose him to be in her power .	30.705389427225533
The next morning , as she was going down stairs , she was met by her father , who came out of his library with a letter in his hand .	25.420290460135302
Yet it did , and even a third .	106.10034507216042
I am glad he is gone .	69.2854076574449
There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself .	29.48122928493824
With such rivals for the notice of the fair , as Wickham and the officers , Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance ;	25.643494168154284
but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only .	50.16403285115063
Who could about such a nasty little freckled thing ?	41.43770888892417
A small sum could not do all this .	70.40951688113711
and having to relate such a thing of his sister !	56.00487747762959
Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt .	54.162447562262585
I almost envy you the pleasure , and yet I believe it would be too much for me , or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle .	27.903505109702923
Oh !	298.0706733468098
Poor Charlotte !	460.39677295623756
She grew absolutely ashamed of herself .	50.774806373321645
Oh !	298.0706733468098
We must trespass a little longer on your kindness .	63.77698726554697
Philips's vulgarity was another , and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance ;	45.342593580856615
I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back .	41.258842773032676
Had the late Darcy liked me less , his son might have borne with me better ;	45.143676371051285
Oh !	298.0706733468098
It would not be easy , indeed , to catch their expression , but their colour and shape , and the eye-lashes , so remarkably fine , might be copied .	20.724620213061332
And poor Darcy !	183.60174913638426
You are lucky in having such a master .	50.15237477313814
Is this to be endured !	115.3259545898765
Mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted ;	54.62434886954008
It was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re-animated , and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's attractions .	17.696647145990845
I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side , for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing , if she had been well looked after .	24.970881135182932
It is Bingley I am sure .	54.11767515744021
It cannot be for me , it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened .	40.60591947390181
He had by that time reached it also , and holding out a letter , which she instinctively took , said with a look of haughty composure , I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you .	19.014577799686016
the former continued the subject , by saying , But tell me all and every thing about it , which I have not already heard .	34.10009115281755
my dear Lydia , she cried , when shall we meet again ?	57.27322931721023
and sleeping one night on the road , reached Longbourn by dinner-time the next day .	24.054591564838795
Yes , I call it a very easy distance .	55.754593225524864
and then till her sister came down , she had to listen to all he had to say , of his own happiness , and of Jane's perfections ;	29.93357957066449
Elizabeth immediately began playing again .	78.14021051719183
Good gracious !	216.59187369776393
To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh ;	74.19712141739328
where , where is my uncle ?	222.97756587745997
And with no one to speak to , of what I felt , no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had !	35.48579330188773
How could I ever think her like her nephew ?	87.92733321473723
Within doors there was Lady Catherine , books , and a billiard table , but gentlemen cannot be always within doors ;	21.74052539010711
A house in town !	190.3085400619607
It seemed like wilful ill-nature , or a voluntary penance , for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away , but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her .	20.58880002428473
I am going to Gretna Green , and if you cannot guess with who , I shall think you a simpleton , for there is but one man in the world I love , and he is an angel .	20.979132361199838
But perhaps , added he , stopping in his walk , and turning towards her , these offences might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design .	17.512637948421837
Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten ;	74.42309618539495
Well , well , and so Bingley is coming down , sister , ( for Philips first brought her the news ) Well , so much the better .	27.573426351547546
We never had any governess .	143.5681497074518
and no change was visible in either , except that the loss of her favourite sister , or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business , had given something more of fretfulness than usual , to the accents of Kitty .	19.544854439039735
With the mention of Derbyshire , there were many ideas connected .	48.73393603524016
and detestable as such a step must make her were it known , she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go .	23.691887672545626
He seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologised for his intrusion , by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within .	21.686254948285615
for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce .	39.703612543245946
With a stronger voice she soon added , I have this comfort immediately , that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side , and that it has done no harm to any one but myself .	25.88395272795998
and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane , received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth .	20.32167482174066
Collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure , and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview , with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied , since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character .	17.042387699012753
but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy's opinion , and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities , by which some part of her family were connected with that corps .	16.866285818331157
I suppose you have heard of it ;	67.07795998805254
VOL .	531.6294007955007
and , though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene .	17.25826476020877
added Elizabeth ;	536.7166312089561
In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton and see how every body went on ;	30.004783563643702
She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject , and related , with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration , the shocking rudeness of Darcy .	19.375149833221798
and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource , if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family , were unfavourably answered .	22.760685357130846
But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible ;	49.42955696182311
I believe I have now told you every thing .	45.53197949081809
He did trace them easily to Clapham , but no farther ;	46.61853756759908
This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers , but Bennet , who quarrelled with no compliments , answered most readily , You are very kind , sir , I am sure ;	24.11193744133409
And gathering her work together , she was hastening away , when Elizabeth called out , Dear Ma'am , do not go .	20.607179420700437
for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him .	33.21706376076788
Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy , and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps .	28.485864491897743
On the gentlemen's appearing , her colour increased ;	62.44888955322331
Oh !	298.0706733468098
yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said , You are mistaken , Darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way , than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner .	22.220860957495194
and then thought no more of the matter : and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them , restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike .	25.551730591483942
and in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard .	21.262777768175162
as good natured , and as unaffected , though not quite so chatty .	46.447128974308605
for of what use could it apparently be to any one , that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him , should then be overthrown ?	36.374705346374064
Oh !	298.0706733468098
He could number the fields in every direction , and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump .	24.531682210498037
Bennet had very often wished , before this period of his life , that , instead of spending his whole income , he had laid by an annual sum , for the better provision of his children , and of his wife , if she survived him .	19.449046144109747
His sisters were fine women , with an air of decided fashion .	40.370781697766375
On the following Monday , Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife , who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn .	30.9381567204918
Kitty has no discretion in her coughs , said her father ;	62.832914845639294
she really rejoiced at it .	141.5160492026412
By many significant looks and silent entreaties , did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance , but in vain ;	25.69965103991965
He answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily .	20.70743083683763
and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion , that whenever Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate , it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at James's .	20.468078378430096
Miss Lucas is married and settled .	103.07120099266258
Bingley was ready , Georgiana was eager , and Darcy determined , to be pleased .	47.877366329665236
and she could do nothing but think , and think with wonder , of Darcy's civility , and above all , of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister .	25.303081507788878
Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight , and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister .	27.777947015234297
The good news quickly spread through the house ;	45.32903054336095
Let us hope , therefore , that her being there may teach her her own insignificance .	38.515984615664266
He seldom appeared really animated .	64.49041567686197
Having now a good house and very sufficient income , he intended to marry ;	53.877473977004776
You refuse , then , to oblige me .	62.44791477470078
Miss Bingley I am sure cannot .	69.41236313020565
and , moreover , to enter into an engagement of allowing her , during your life , one hundred pounds per annum .	22.34864186825169
After sitting a little while with Jane , on Miss Bingley's appearance and invitation , the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour .	29.995108678403554
names , facts , every thing mentioned without ceremony .	53.583918630047876
Lady Catherine seemed pleased .	103.6236305017401
Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest .	85.43007888083679
I have not that pain .	85.64524254372941
The ladies were somewhat more fortunate , for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window , that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse .	14.507196455845786
he had a pleasant countenance , and easy , unaffected manners .	43.21841146420489
and I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body .	20.514102149179866
his civility , therefore , was most prompt in inviting Collins to join his daughters in their walk ;	43.32882159245851
But I knew I should persuade you at last .	58.41129639159573
though it was not put in as it ought to be .	60.07329181708403
the agitations of former partiality entirely so .	72.92514561746462
but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune , part from her authoritative manner , and the rest from the pride of her nephew , who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class .	17.21805294738524
She was not the better pleased with his gallantry , from the idea it suggested of something more .	37.15001939533546
Sir William could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves .	29.572690836611983
The letter was to this effect : MY DEAR LIZZY , I wish you joy .	30.55126043910692
Your own heart , your own conscience , must tell you why I come .	55.280267660899646
without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person ;	68.24967905650514
and to Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction .	48.265601518097256
I wonder what he can be doing there .	61.97337049352941
Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment ;	59.734634508134334
What , all five out at once ?	120.48890578347945
Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance , when you were in Kent ?	56.842271090702546
After walking several miles in a leisurely manner , and too busy to know any thing about it , they found at last , on examining their watches , that it was time to be at home .	20.671764729477335
but she does not know , no one can know how much I suffer from what she says .	34.559289922567835
Wickham , after a few moments , touched his hat a salutation which Darcy just deigned to return .	26.61724258587197
But , Lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it .	33.83460689542779
Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss De Bourgh ate , pressing her to try some other dish , and fearing she were indisposed .	21.523117160977822
Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage .	43.306948547324396
But when her mother was gone , Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters .	32.47814519226667
What a stroke was this for poor Jane !	67.8881955406939
and she had barely time to express her satisfaction , and prepare for such a visitor , when Bingley's quick step was heard on the stairs , and in a moment he entered the room .	17.228286861556928
Yes ;	506.5076850786652
Oh , yes !	155.41443917661368
Such a change in a man of so much pride , excited not only astonishment but gratitude for to love , ardent love , it must be attributed ;	26.59220950381215
I am sure , she added , if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and suffers a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without exception , the sweetest temper I ever met with .	19.163979509886765
She was confident of having performed her duty , and to fret over unavoidable evils , or augment them by anxiety , was no part of her disposition .	19.83492277957572
You will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one .	39.85944261082464
She is a handsome girl , about fifteen or sixteen , and I understand highly accomplished .	28.524792406102968
repeated the other , as she ran into her room to prepare .	67.06864441067934
Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them ;	52.790794242305
She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever ;	48.15759929581015
Lady Catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us , were the means of removing all my doubts .	31.153022091184216
I expected to find a more reasonable young woman .	58.623565396247415
Darcy , only for a few minutes to take leave , but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour , hoping for her return , and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found .	22.525367633793948
Give me farther particulars .	166.2221779948419
do not repeat what I then said .	88.87729442079083
That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain , but I will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears .	20.70466111611334
Gardiner looked at her niece , desirous of knowing how she , whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its acceptance , but Elizabeth had turned away her head .	26.15869971215507
He really believed , that were it not for the inferiority of her connections , he should be in some danger .	34.59460212924979
Her ladyship received them civilly , but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else ;	27.21268422404096
Collins , said she , speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter ;	36.2408882283375
He is just what a young man ought to be , said she , sensible , good humoured , lively ;	31.475815339542798
And when we do return , it shall not be like other travellers , without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing .	25.74417279982374
Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection .	56.81062369584777
He simpers , and smirks , and makes love to us all .	28.788449928485434
I cannot understand it .	93.7371566311997
Can you , yourself , Lizzy , so wholly give him up , as to believe him capable of it ?	36.246480109461565
She was a woman of mean understanding , little information , and uncertain temper .	28.41233136560135
said Elizabeth , but the terms , I suppose , must be complied with .	40.6106442861933
Yes , Miss Bennet , interest ;	60.88276500104793
The visit was returned in due form .	59.16906598364019
But Jane was to go home with her , and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation .	35.77044289345816
They were ignorant , idle , and vain .	40.6983086682661
Yes .	764.2245053209904
accompanied by a violent yawn .	107.52780408732995
Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other .	55.985676283583445
But who was your mother ?	110.21107814461085
Then pray speak aloud .	147.04121932729868
but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent .	42.46587411596352
And when her sisters abused it as ugly , she added , with perfect unconcern , Oh !	30.33191592238075
But if I go on , I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem .	28.71948671534593
and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners , which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball .	25.595445121359532
when it became apparent , that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match .	22.99623834984102
and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance .	37.065730139497894
But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world , replied Darcy .	28.275245363822826
and added , that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage .	26.113633819624095
She highly approved his forbearance , and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other , as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn , and during the walk , he particularly attended to her .	17.563875885037305
True .	653.8562846757216
Bennet , through the assistance of servants , contrived to have the earliest tidings of it , that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side , might be as long as it could .	22.02015439378481
Indeed you are mistaken .	170.5916195854366
Lizzy , to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family !	43.09566644362375
Not a soul knew of it , but and Forster , and Kitty and me , except my aunt , for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns ;	24.18246991711539
From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage , it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew ;	29.69901053937219
That he was not a good-tempered man , had been her firmest opinion .	34.49310908656544
She longed to see Philips , the Lucases , and all their other neighbours , and to hear herself called Wickham , by each of them ;	28.258351211060763
Does your charge give you much trouble ?	101.84677657643802
It has been a very agreeable day , said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth .	44.636817639803674
Can I have the carriage ?	171.6301936288109
CHAPTER V Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth ;	33.42115249280991
at his own house especially , and of a Sunday evening when he has nothing to do .	48.65312651713734
When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance , and courting the good opinion of people , with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace ;	23.392668856395794
And that made the men suspect something , and then they soon found out what was the matter .	38.58987027393496
It must be something particular , to take him there at this time of year .	46.586062925410445
In what an amiable light does this place him !	75.76843598894729
The envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , hot pressed paper , well covered with a lady's fair , flowing hand ;	15.87525059818236
but the shortness of her stay , and yet more , the alteration of her manner , would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer .	29.13399303696427
Perhaps it would have been better ;	101.83437293880144
Have not you always hated him ?	129.5181628335307
but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence , what chance could there be of improvement ?	35.668641025844316
I am not now to learn , replied Collins , with a formal wave of the hand , that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first applies for their favour ;	17.347576276524453
for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible .	65.6024021595871
The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming ;	24.277763835515817
Elizabeth , who was left by herself , now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled , that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation .	22.09597066727514
She could think of nothing else , and yet whether Bingley's regard had really died away , or were suppressed by his friends' interference ;	21.472211940640438
And she was only sixteen last June .	68.76873270042516
I think you said she was a widow , sir ?	40.81034479370799
Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine , who called out to know what they were talking of .	30.032538949901305
I do assure you , that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain .	27.636298627265028
Many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter ;	76.50385849281055
Lady Catherine , I have nothing farther to say .	51.886800639843074
and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible .	19.36539321946526
yet there had been that in his voice , which was not like ease .	62.749124547808385
But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Darcy's pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers ;	21.244952487228936
He then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not tired , and they stood together on the lawn .	26.857600238470223
The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn .	50.116648586775035
Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these ;	61.0682877339828
Risk any thing rather than her displeasure ;	69.26331213153954
There was now an interest , however , in believing the housekeeper ;	47.743663485078194
But his pride , his abominable pride , his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane , his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging , though he could not justify it , and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Wickham , his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny , soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited .	16.647363874913328
They are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses ;	22.490116699011942
Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's .	67.16348310187114
Well , I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Bingley .	28.320738905430982
No governess !	315.15176571248617
But our visitor was very obstinate .	68.99220091366345
As a clergyman , moreover , I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence ;	20.437758064909733
When she is secure of him , there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses .	31.610316722335238
She had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses , which he had already had the honour of preaching before her .	21.48402951963284
He drew a chair near her .	66.56717113959714
But whatever may be the sentiments which Wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character .	23.17592078935502
Georgiana's reception of them was very civil ;	101.75551084775273
Oh !	298.0706733468098
But how did he account for it ?	75.91227475480298
Bennet was really in a most pitiable state .	67.7116918669142
My father is gone to London , and Jane has written to beg my uncle's immediate assistance , and we shall be off , I hope , in half an hour .	23.21561205876421
Mary was the only daughter who remained at home ;	90.1688053551008
It is not Bingley , said her husband ;	56.21032747157393
how unlucky !	469.6512143372834
Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as Elizabeth half expected Bingley to do , he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine's visit .	28.179072690325704
Do not copy , display , perform , distribute or redistribute this electronic work , or any part of this electronic work , without prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1 .	12.665243164130068
But , whatever may be their own wishes , it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother's .	31.83341567369194
He then went away , and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself .	23.9295889177656
is she handsome ?	391.4232604354933
She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could , provided he chose with discretion ;	28.5369391645845
she knew not how to believe that Darcy could be so unworthy of Bingley's regard ;	57.87185566760352
I dare say you will find him very agreeable .	46.141367873141434
That is right .	150.04021771127952
and what can he have to say ?	101.51108659145349
His disposition must be dreadful .	89.89339288515075
But the fact is , that being , as I am , to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father , ( who , however , may live many years longer , ) I could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters , that the loss to them might be as little as possible , when the melancholy event takes place which , however , as I have already said , may not be for several years .	18.52306039247728
and you shall all have a bowl of punch , to make merry at her wedding .	32.27977028756814
Till the next morning , however , she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance .	26.636102337558306
If you are a good girl for the next ten years , I will take you to a review at the end of them .	31.140957052256162
Elizabeth loved absurdities , but she had known Sir William's too long .	35.39523730826859
Women fancy admiration means more than it does .	74.27037045027205
Your's sincerely , c .	121.27300963913517
I shall offer to pay him to-morrow ;	52.874686338753044
said she .	372.7761627948212
But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Wickham , when she read with somewhat clearer attention , a relation of events , which , if true , must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself , her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition .	17.397994491355046
Almost as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life .	30.158483269689402
Oh !	298.0706733468098
and his sisters are charming women .	74.26504761177104
and will probably be much talked of .	64.16655519845176
and soon afterwards Darcy , drawing near Elizabeth , said to her Do not you feel a great inclination , Miss Bennet , to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel ?	17.485823359459932
I had not been long in Hertfordshire , before I saw , in common with others , that Bingley preferred your eldest sister , to any other young woman in the country .	26.744572120763554
It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again !	38.652895141830186
You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this .	27.02488970038156
The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed , the unacknowledged were silent .	32.576917992212685
Very true ;	344.9448202499491
I should be sorry to think so ill of him , in the very beginning of our relationship .	30.69486219449153
But on returning to the drawing-room , when her letter was finished , she saw , to her infinite surprise , there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her .	22.21917023404938
and Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected .	35.42614634074967
He then said , I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly .	37.93008655642952
four or five thousand a year .	107.45625862347315
they are all silly and ignorant like other girls ;	73.72255978300731
Collins was not a sensible man , and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society ;	26.8844895040973
I am going to open the instrument , Eliza , and you know what follows .	25.34661445319892
His fear of her , has always operated , I know , when they were together ;	37.81318232236086
nor will I be dissuaded from it .	94.79685329162702
Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it , and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards ;	22.135308934726886
You have liked many a stupider person .	59.28146521520225
I will go to Meryton , said she , as soon as I am dressed , and tell the good , good news to my sister Philips .	30.11404217081381
He brought it with him for us to see .	79.63068955096138
I have done with you from this very day .	69.02160673869895
and thither also went Wickham , undoubtedly by design ;	37.0859999132151
there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance !	64.53260887512602

Yet he knew to the contrary himself .	113.58719010129232
but that after their removal , it had been every where discussed ;	43.86944018625615
but since we see every day that where there is affection , young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune , from entering into engagements with each other , how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if I am tempted , or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist ?	16.45880461477581
yes , his misfortunes have been great indeed .	79.01017538438315
she repented , though she hardly knew of what .	76.63806498290106
And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him , without any reason .	28.70757697855102
Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse , and that she could not leave her .	30.42419220505249
But people themselves alter so much , that there is something new to be observed in them for ever .	28.737979830007202
Miss Darcy and her brother appeared , and this formidable introduction took place .	44.223271493956545
She related the subject of the pictures , the dimensions of the rooms , and the price of the furniture , in vain .	17.95581177151104
Yes , all of them , I think .	77.43646488366845
If I was to go through the world , I could not meet with a better .	37.01297193033961
What , is he coming home , and without poor Lydia !	60.31407476259505
At our time of life , it is not so pleasant I can tell you , to be making new acquaintance every day ;	35.15495236122063
I would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ;	30.57307449812765
I talked about the dance , and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room , or the number of couples .	18.420564666704514
I had not thought Darcy so bad as this though I have never liked him , I had not thought so very ill of him I had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general , but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge , such injustice , such inhumanity as this !	19.832334356712362
E Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg : 1 .	30.53775950515972
and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn , they would be going there for ever .	37.13885318969026
As for the gentleman himself , his feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence .	26.74470666272271
inmates of the same house , sharing the same amusements , objects of the same parental care .	25.651343006168425
But what is to be done about Pemberley ?	68.78792838774719
In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage .	79.0329580881414
And men take care that they should .	79.41066589927391
Elizabeth accepted their company , and the three young ladies set off together .	31.584598710785098
They may be modified and printed and given away you may do practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks .	19.99754221010299
Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball ;	27.449752587648184
She plays and sings all day long .	42.30513569300815
Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern .	88.65208234652378
The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl .	34.69298226159812
and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries , which Jane was equally eager to satisfy .	27.56372663567213
such an openness and gentleness in his manner .	70.30369529692292
The discomposure of spirits , which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into , could not be easily overcome ;	28.749516707378746
Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages .	19.794440391431518
and even Jane , who believed still less of it , became almost hopeless , more especially as the time was now come , when if they had gone to Scotland , which she had never before entirely despaired of , they must in all probability have gained some news of them .	24.890371999442934
But I wonder how long you would have gone on , if you had been left to yourself .	34.90834333677038
You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you .	37.570854410279765
Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Collins , and I will never see you again if you do .	30.1382375383126
whichever were the case , though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference , her sister's situation remained the same , her peace equally wounded .	28.9671479328432
To be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation , had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town ;	34.599983838178495
The possibility of Collins's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two ;	29.46444053593917
coaxed and threatened her by turns .	68.72696466180471
The housekeeper came ;	141.06646567926984
She was of great use and comfort to us all , and lady Lucas has been very kind ;	34.84570854408128
and I trust I am resigned .	59.7970313941269
Perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her .	62.675805397193514
if that is all , I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire ;	46.178897349278785
Not that I care about it , though .	68.23892598467296
Howsoever that may be , you are grievously to be pitied , in which opinion I am not only joined by Collins , but likewise by lady Catherine and her daughter , to whom I have related the affair .	22.58517031878895
Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public .	53.65806089301725
The comfort to her , of the regiment's approaching removal , was indeed beyond expression .	31.86687533899687
so easily guided that his worth was invaluable ;	79.87960578951494
his estate there is a noble one .	85.49021955203759
and as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together .	21.611406308864314
Wickham !	971.5627647180169
but Lydia , with perfect indifference , continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter , and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day , as he was going the next morning to London .	18.23525844220905
and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected .	25.04898356713981
No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph .	41.811917650272015
Assistance is impossible ;	238.83150834455896
They had , therefore , many acquaintance in common ;	67.16476099112262
To my fancy , it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men .	31.515919705692035
Bennet said only , Nonsense , nonsense !	75.15125662829368
But does not Jane correspond with the sister ?	44.498376050113755
I cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought , nor their offences against myself .	24.71779251856705
But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood , and take Pemberley for a kind of model .	26.463746038996394
Lord bless me !	225.2329035835291
till , roused to resentment by his subsequent language , she lost all compassion in anger .	32.07185224805064
How much you must have gone through !	93.31694287212683
Lady Catherine was a tall , large woman , with strongly-marked features , which might once have been handsome .	25.829034616180707
But , perhaps he could not in her mother's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt .	33.599891851628996
Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse .	66.37755813853639
Who would have thought she could be so thin and small !	51.53329761809553
And so was I You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner .	38.12185086275567
It is such a spur to one's genius , such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind .	23.738440315704175
That she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head .	38.92556038119836
it was impossible not to long to know .	81.08443825402937
She will drop the acquaintance entirely .	84.10612588260484
If you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits , and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment .	17.452953768261448
In the gallery there were many family portraits , but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger .	33.885588891056884
Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome ;	50.6706341321755
We will settle with your father about the money afterwards ;	66.66089880236419
Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment .	91.83690580781864
Bennet had no turn for economy , and her husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income .	27.146800508881952
He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him , nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity ;	20.021243926401088
and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time , than as she hoped that , by Caroline's not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him .	21.739690800312058
But when she read , and re-read with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu , so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate .	18.059563428112863
As for their mother , Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will , and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure , which astonished her husband and daughters .	23.26499317022344
The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough ;	41.811049818654624
The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors , and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife , was exactly what he had wished for ;	20.150059960404576
Teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind !	68.89127869218333
She would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions .	46.97314624202703
This will not do , said Elizabeth .	93.97591695079713
Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage , and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at Rosings .	23.856885678762197
He has the promise of an ensigncy in General 's regiment , now quartered in the North .	19.170997272041316
and covering her face with her handkerchief , Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else ;	28.563568526961646
It was a handsome modern building , well situated on rising ground .	26.411058868796506
Oh , brother , how kind you are !	71.57849180694349
But if you are really innocent and ignorant , I must be more explicit .	30.190433240480516
Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she ceased speaking , replied thus , My dear Miss Elizabeth , I have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding , but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity , and those which regulate the clergy ;	14.10145461639489
That is exactly what I should have supposed of you , said Elizabeth .	40.26567427592926
If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is , I shall know what to think .	33.82828254249493
If she does not object to it , why should we ?	52.946426455090936
Having been frequently in company with him since her return , agitation was pretty well over ;	37.48647830268223
Philips visited them all , and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before .	32.70673487971401
Yours , c .	153.9190396338396
and so fervently did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets , which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity .	18.4281245866355
Louisa , you will not mind my waking Hurst .	64.65619671199208
I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much , and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help .	24.126304815227197
but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on .	37.747090309668664
Thank you , Sir , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me .	50.3179259998074
I think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements .	42.46205697290069
shall I get you one ?	215.01626271331006
Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication .	26.219647777973243
CHAPTER II .	223.11563766813362
If your master would marry , you might see more of him .	62.70828675132795
From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane , and were indebted to Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along , and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton , which he never failed coming to inform them of , though it happened almost every day .	18.69765334403232
With three younger sisters grown up , replied Elizabeth smiling , your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it .	30.068291812315714
and now , because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds , you want to find out that he is mercenary .	23.077342467436036
Elizabeth , at work in the opposite corner , saw it all with great delight .	38.417183663758
We now come to the point .	103.01915214060956
Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone ;	32.305409930882064
It had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought to be imitated , though it could not be equalled , by some exertion of politeness on their side ;	18.36810494161055
Collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed .	41.61843950174777
If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set forth in this agreement , you must obtain permission in writing from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael Hart , the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark .	11.960427990291205
The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions .	21.49995125092295
He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt's , where his regret and vexation , and the concern of every body was well talked over .	28.610051889097186
These causes must be stated , though briefly .	53.633558053009175
A little time therefore .	191.16234337797783
I did not wink at you .	48.4531681627005
Some people call him proud ;	131.99564820941976
Darcy only smiled ;	248.26774300805042
and Collins have a comfortable income , but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance .	23.45430996781738
Elizabeth particularly , who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy , was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied .	22.995665535128772
I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun .	39.68201907013612
for in a quarter of an hour's t te- -t te with Bennet before breakfast , a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house , and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes , that a mistress for it might be found at Longbourn , produced from her , amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement , a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on .	15.017012139158453
nor will such behaviour as this , ever induce me to be explicit .	42.36311798050354
Upon my word , Sir , cried Elizabeth , your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration .	32.754944618741845
Gardiner was a sensible , gentleman-like man , greatly superior to his sister , as well by nature as education .	29.037225109259687
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly .	52.65553485582201
You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles , for you are wasting your time with me .	34.28146568368946
though I thought it would be very good fun if I was .	51.34951721113758
Who is to fight Wickham , and make him marry her , if he comes away ?	35.9750093343894
She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country .	36.18468476630506
Bennet treated the matter differently .	120.58944399638898
Follies and nonsense , whims and inconsistencies do divert me , I own , and I laugh at them whenever I can .	22.988706837239274
Gardiner abused her stupidity .	129.91674792562134
You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine , but which I have never acknowledged .	31.015132104559832
His character is thereby complete .	77.43180529361643
and Miss Lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon that establishment were gained .	21.070650883032016
but Sir William's good breeding carried him through it all ;	42.49935776143224
My youngest sister has left all her friends has eloped ;	54.34979539670698
I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments ;	26.31608527418878
and without any intention of coming back again .	45.06546257666584
and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments .	38.51320587491473
They will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to Longbourn ;	44.1691884022294
Elizabeth looked archly , and turned away .	50.47187852725626
I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world , and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns .	23.568828798233046
But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed , so doubtful , so indefinite , that it gives me very little idea .	21.72595394516254
A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request , without waiting for arguments to reason one into it .	26.025515006296732
so handsome !	594.3912268223584
The dinner too in its turn was highly admired ;	61.0507278774509
CHAPTER XVII .	223.11563766813362
one knows exactly what to think .	124.01664047288793
Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure ;	67.83030605854937
It was a rational scheme to be sure !	53.765153640603764
though her spirits are greatly shaken .	122.6805682190975
As they passed through the hall , Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and drawing-room , and pronouncing them , after a short survey , to be decent looking rooms , walked on .	15.509042161975843
CHAPTER V I have been thinking it over again , Elizabeth , said her uncle , as they drove from the town ;	30.728089731546042
Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane .	51.240102742028704
She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage , and had a few minutes' conversation with Charlotte , but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out .	20.573732013418617
But he had given a reason for his interference , which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief .	31.07197494567919
But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted .	37.691806221543025
and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself , is heightened into something still more interesting , from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister .	23.194499895595733
Upon this information , they instantly passed through the hall once more , and ran across the lawn after their father , who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock .	19.957664176945134
and Gardiner smiled .	144.8543204108545
Do not you want to know who has taken it ?	64.50126269706163
While they were dressing , he came two or three times to their different doors , to recommend their being quick , as Lady Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner .	23.04097939055733
and as soon as they were in the parlour , he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode , and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment .	15.656712790653248
He was directly invited to join their party , but he declined it , observing , that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together , with either of which motives his joining them would interfere .	20.184210494364525
pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before .	55.596238401135466
I am sorry to say it of them , but so it is .	44.82130280310018
Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat , he suddenly addressed her with , I hope Bingley will like it Lizzy .	28.881961478051462
1 .	384.9991185797929
There is one point , on which I want your advice .	58.018572203064075
They then sat down , and when her enquiries after Rosings were made , seemed in danger of sinking into total silence .	25.551579274729086
I assure you , Madam , he replied , that she does not need such advice .	21.172311307824497
Her answer , therefore , was not propitious , at least not to Elizabeth's wishes , for she was impatient to get home .	30.21071998914132
Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to Miss Darcy , without calling her attention .	22.70182872376821
They both set off , and the conjectures of the remaining three continued , though with little satisfaction , till the door was thrown open , and their visitor entered .	22.847969715609075
I mend pens remarkably well .	39.56890978854464
He does not want abilities .	67.92160308333689
and though prepared , as he told Elizabeth , to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house , he was used to be free from them there ;	23.944620336205706
My situation in life , my connections with the family of De Bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ;	29.246007407176688
In Meryton they parted ;	148.28538306690479
You do not know what he really is ;	57.533775436932714
and , before she could reply , he added , It is above eight months .	28.634556428174438
We are each of an unsocial , taciturn disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room , and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb .	17.404158643967943
and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother , when they were met by the butler , who said , If you are looking for my master , ma'am , he is walking towards the little copse .	18.208253693316255
whence , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods overspreading many , and occasionally part of the stream .	15.690569574055893
I know you will contrive it all .	58.624829665628766
Their manner of living , even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home , was unsettled in the extreme .	25.258330561996946
Oh , lord !	118.99858181000101
but when the living fell , it was given elsewhere .	44.504243717435344
the morning in bustle and shopping , and the evening at one of the theatres .	34.441755903016144
The wedding took place ;	95.31982577406427
These are conditions , which , considering every thing , I had no hesitation in complying with , as far as I thought myself privileged , for you .	26.796460595543092
No aunt , no officers , no news could be sought after ;	53.20357986494625
but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity .	31.00374633511779
cried Bingley .	406.40629584527994
We want none of them ;	113.3945794312765
cried Elizabeth .	274.15392210803657
Sir William , how can you tell such a story ?	48.04604738972315
Yes ;	506.5076850786652
How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate !	37.697012024707114
She longed to speak , but could think of nothing to say ;	49.93221921018124
But the clothes , the wedding clothes !	64.46798883483434
Bennet and her daughters then departed , and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane , leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Darcy ;	26.450231366024624
Do not imagine , Miss Bennet , that your ambition will ever be gratified .	38.33323843568501
we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster's .	45.301638061506765
How humiliating is this discovery !	113.57373770668256
and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage ;	50.74451620073482
but I do not think there would have been any fun in it .	35.09569602508072
It is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us .	33.865286574895094
Not one party , or scheme , or any thing .	58.148978124995004
He replied , and was again silent .	65.96883512529934
So far each recital confirmed the other : but when she came to the will , the difference was great .	39.00819204386501
I dare say Bingley will be very glad to see you ;	35.492286709479686
Here you are in your own family .	118.157499226552
Since her father's death , her home has been London , where a lady lives with her , and superintends her education .	28.839730191090887
Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire , paid his compliments , with his usual reserve , to Collins ;	30.98121399122797
Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter , Darcy must speak for himself .	46.36070670955762
You are a gentleman's daughter .	80.15848789028001
I do not recollect that we did .	52.535951031064734
As soon as they were gone , Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits ;	43.40927947602495
and have such tremblings , such flutterings , all over me , such spasms in my side , and pains in my head , and such beatings at heart , that I can get no rest by night nor by day .	21.60110158442111
Jane shook her head .	134.45903428723147
Upon my word I say no more here than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood , except Netherfield .	36.05655892271827
You are quite a visit in my debt , Bingley , she added , for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us , as soon as you returned .	24.250998046273043
for , by the bye , you are to understand , that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them .	31.99939795158827
but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation .	20.66599257631108
Let me know every thing that I am to know , without delay .	43.585171257936544
Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him , but this step ( and let us rejoice over it ) marks nothing bad at heart .	23.45700635384824
Yes , replied Darcy , who could contain himself no longer , but that was only when I first knew her , for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance .	25.099981809005243
I ask only a comfortable home ;	71.90628887285395
I certainly shall not .	108.77994192973883
I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us .	46.51736349574371
When they get to our age I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do .	33.760558786361976
Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine , was in a different style ;	58.49387915140518
and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it .	35.59500671613598
Bennet was doubly engaged , on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane , who sat some way below her , and on the other , retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases ;	21.037030455023274
Charlotte had seen them from her husband's room , crossing the road , and immediately running into the other , told the girls what an honour they might expect , adding , I may thank you , Eliza , for this piece of civility .	22.438053192024217
It has been coming on so gradually , that I hardly know when it began .	35.38348539417907
she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression .	36.10285744816451
yes the handsomest young lady that ever was seen ;	77.36588971892083
It is not that I do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman's of superior execution .	25.5388430502355
How much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow !	51.81295543567529
Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance , mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste .	22.931084266847314
My aunt Philips wants you so to get husbands , you can't think .	43.41245880936074
It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next , and a still greater , that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again , and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits , by all that affection could do .	22.786925224493565
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood , this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families , that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters .	20.60030779706131
Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified , never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting .	37.88375171988385
Next to being married , a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then .	44.76077065358372
Make haste , and come down this moment .	58.33438073511661
Now I have got some news for you , said Lydia , as they sat down to table .	34.25601093673248
what has she to do with it ?	197.63226904920413
Its windows opening to the ground , admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house , and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn .	12.44796317766001
That is to say , you had given your permission .	65.17096775851601
One may be continually abusive without saying any thing just ;	43.006856361315265
no it is not for me to be driven away by Darcy .	57.42075535473474
There was now employment for the whole party ;	53.68110656877461
The expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity .	24.022893781463498
I shall certainly try to get the better .	49.34092799797428
She read over her aunt's commendation of him again and again .	49.632902792850025
How is half such a sum to be repaid ?	48.10226816343511
and depend upon it , Bingley never stirs without him .	32.802127658902776
we are all in an uproar .	136.35267882696417
If , in the explanation of them which is due to myself , I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your's , I can only say that I am sorry .	19.691643913728516
Wont it , Kitty ?	192.8413086822621
Oh !	298.0706733468098
This accounted to Elizabeth for Wickham's being among them .	66.46158352269146
I shall now know how to act .	64.53241821930065
I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of the covies for you .	19.441064894988852
Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister , that they did not once sit down to a family dinner .	24.5880662407986
But I shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity of your sister's countenance and air was such , as might have given the most acute observer , a conviction that , however amiable her temper , her heart was not likely to be easily touched .	21.507882663063754
Who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly !	28.39405482654899
He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place , and his intrigues , all honoured with the title of seduction , had been extended into every tradesman's family .	15.452287620325743
Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment ;	33.66633896738864
But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being withheld from seeing Jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless .	19.076939858351192
CHAPTER VIII .	234.75576465601785
Long said so too , for I asked her whether you did not .	54.26993055260678
E8 .	806.2902343264145
That is very strange .	105.75247233662142
Oh !	298.0706733468098
It was a subject which they could not mention before me .	45.647792796837486
But when you have had time to think it all over , I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done .	31.42443487208933
and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits ;	25.63180566500503
That is a question which Darcy only can answer .	55.5194430975015
You were not by , when I told mamma , and the others , all about it .	41.42524681191456
When Darcy returned to the saloon , Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister .	24.0947049768264
But that is one great difference between us .	64.43513884780666
Her mother stepped forwards , embraced her , and welcomed her with rapture ;	26.690487164263317
The express was sent off directly .	65.83393264053784
Could he expect that her friends would not step forward ?	61.3283015453184
Darcy !	659.7571091073834
and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature , by the testimony so highly in his favour , and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light , which yesterday had produced .	19.24424390796049
It is impossible for me to be impartial .	43.523350330395566
Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love ;	36.63350204000521
But vanity , not love , has been my folly .	53.69633511092704
His understanding and opinions all please me ;	68.65272492099058
When the party broke up , Lydia returned with Forster to Meryton , from whence they were to set out early the next morning .	28.935518794710003
and she spoke very little , except in a low voice , to Jenkinson , in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable , and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said , and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes .	18.27204318104668
but he soon afterwards said , I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month .	41.428957453792286
and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise , and owned she encouraged it as much as possible .	19.594058578519515
Yes , very different .	153.74110042167194
Jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening .	27.50619318319391
She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue , while in town , for the recovery of his daughter .	23.578711604952638
A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth ;	45.584121559275104
Jones says we must not think of moving her .	64.32437549927634
Why does she not come in ?	149.29436210936294
By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure ;	70.38642358024832
And that is quite impossible ;	141.9518329592457
An hour , however , saw the whole completed ;	57.19859851861488
Her sisters were uneasy for her , but her mother was delighted .	52.75853235641479
or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour .	33.36993886287726
You must decide for yourself , said Elizabeth , and if upon mature deliberation , you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife , I advise you by all means to refuse him .	17.414295135120657
and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions .	25.118523596935905
after going over so many , she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains .	33.8123635231045
Very few days passed in which Collins did not walk to Rosings , and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise ;	28.406023138207864
Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject ;	33.81395692704153
CHAPTER XV .	223.11563766813362
Never , even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield , or his dignified relations at Rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from self-consequence , or unbending reserve as now , when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed , would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings .	20.46527945157233
He has given in all his debts ;	87.8769348969749
CHAPTER VII .	223.11563766813362
Shall you like to have such a brother ?	87.204003612732
Oh !	298.0706733468098
Your affectionate friend , LYDIA BENNET .	56.21360172564207
Did it , said he , did it soon make you think better of me ?	67.6689913060288
she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library .	48.81503590313851
However , he wrote some verses on her , and very pretty they were .	39.936933149106615
and at length , by repeated assurances that Darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the test of many months suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father's incredulity , and reconcile him to the match .	16.737846099573524
It is more than I engage for , I assure you .	34.72726814473251
He walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very great !	41.15019713652752
As soon as they entered the copse , Lady Catherine began in the following manner : You can be at no loss , Miss Bennet , to understand the reason of my journey hither .	22.03051754843445
To his tacit engagement with Miss De Bourgh ?	46.724554109715335
Elizabeth , having rather expected to affront him , was amazed at his gallantry ;	34.87102850971803
But at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went sorely against the grain ;	17.578946177073117
What a pity it is , mamma , we did not all go .	47.71382173575761
But Bennet , was not so well pleased with it .	53.21929385293371
Tell me once for all , are you engaged to him ?	84.45202938702094
What a good joke it will be !	65.8737306958333
Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her .	47.70430684849263
and as they entered the house , he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men ;	31.220673553915603
and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary .	21.470181816735778
He would scarcely be ten pounds a-year the loser , by the hundred that was to be paid them ;	28.679202074732544
If such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy !	34.4987234429804
Jane , who was not so light , nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth , soon lagged behind , while her sister , panting for breath , came up with him , and eagerly cried out , Oh , Papa , what news ?	18.42528177951852
said Elizabeth .	359.76065498339705
I shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on .	36.6087360271205
He had never had the slightest suspicion .	71.24312747207084
But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him , as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage ?	30.298498584734283
and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley , which might only grieve her sister farther .	25.236138768334694
He sat down for a few moments , and then getting up walked about the room .	25.522146022425726
Elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well ;	27.039477400050774
Her daughter , Miss de Bourgh , will have a very large fortune , and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates .	26.700461257059708
And we mean to treat you all , added Lydia ;	66.66057588891127
for he is now in the custody of his friend , and Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London !	27.386089498809774
Pursuing her way along the lane , she then began it .	52.704532427561894
She was disappointed , and angry with herself for being so .	41.47028655145136
She had been unwilling to mention Bingley ;	52.66095361877702
He is , indeed .	149.73374354667217
He was exactly what he had been , when I knew him in Hertfordshire ;	40.171052618287106
How can Bingley , who seems good humour itself , and is , I really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ?	27.374202565936276
She has a very good notion of fingering , though her taste is not equal to Anne's .	26.778618430006304
Haye-Park might do , said she , if the Gouldings would quit it , or the great house at Stoke , if the drawing-room were larger ;	33.79347134607087
We were born in the same parish , within the same park , the greatest part of our youth was passed together ;	27.20847126158104
CHAPTER II .	223.11563766813362
but with respect to any other leading characteristic , I do not imagine that much has been unfolded .	25.531600572844617
When you told Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes , you meant it to be a sort of panegyric , of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone , and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else ?	20.937867356879426
for to her inexpressible vexation , she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Darcy , who sat opposite to them .	23.180768134118516
It is wonderful , replied Wickham , for almost all his actions may be traced to pride ;	25.680458571681154
At length , however , our kind friend procured the wished-for direction .	30.14672588300037
I think I have heard you say , that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton .	38.31466149257716
advice , which there was every reason to believe would be attended to ;	50.1493208909875
Elizabeth looked surprised .	198.39023881981078
I do not cough for my own amusement , replied Kitty fretfully .	31.949697320088337
To Rosings he then hastened to console Lady Catherine , and her daughter ;	40.93803637073615
I am astonished , said Miss Bingley , that my father should have left so small a collection of books .	26.338430898284088
I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly .	38.00721996942011
I was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off , and then I should have gone quite distracted .	25.87499833423984
they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money , great connections , and pride .	36.80498414629856
he continued after a pause , on seeing Bingley join the group ;	58.178411570034754
and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin .	24.514564001492886
Of this she was perfectly unaware ;	110.9410267836304
'Tis too much !	208.54440866431779
Not a syllable was uttered by either ;	80.7403166202611
Your's , very sincerely , M GARDINER .	60.35084105693129
Collins had a compliment , and an allusion to throw in here , which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter .	31.738675772871723
I have not the pleasure of understanding you , said he , when she had finished her speech .	29.13252916846174
But these things happen so often !	86.9570026815387
The suspicions which had just arisen of Darcy and their niece , directed their observation towards each with an earnest , though guarded , enquiry ;	26.555558923817067
and quitting them both , he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton , denominated from that period Lucas Lodge , where he could think with pleasure of his own importance , and unshackled by business , occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world .	18.457012251609996
I have not the smallest objection to explaining them , said he , as soon as she allowed him to speak .	24.463586828079464
F3 , a full refund of any money paid for a work or a replacement copy , if a defect in the electronic work is discovered and reported to you within <TIME_PERIOD > of receipt of the work .	18.045078788100234
but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal , that her mother , though often disheartened , had never yet despaired of succeeding at last .	19.370152277755363
He was quite young , wonderfully handsome , extremely agreeable , and to crown the whole , he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party .	21.622407016249152
Such relief , however , as it was in her power to afford , by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences , she frequently sent them .	22.335520750929525
It was to be such a secret !	53.312154268507356
and if he is disposed to make them any amends , I shall not be the person to discourage him .	24.151992989321194
His wish of introducing his sister to her , was a compliment of the highest kind .	41.89370568322288
Again she read on .	189.16084846519666
Will you tell me how long you have loved him ?	50.50222172429471
After discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , Miss Lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight ;	16.40535779761896
Yes , and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise .	43.18378837067467
I never heard that it was .	69.5433168616501
they are certainly not gone to Scotland .	79.33335833673519
for it gratified him , he said , to discover that Charlotte Lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter !	26.012197577795785
I did not expect such a compliment .	53.13240529640317
Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other , and the waiter was told that he need not stay .	30.71322348633333
She watched him whenever they were at Rosings , and whenever he came to Hunsford ;	31.123349419868344
Their party in the dining-room was large , for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news : and various were the subjects which occupied them ;	26.6394103115105
and if we were beyond the hour , we could not be married all day .	38.130428354008934
My dear Madam , replied he , let us be for ever silent on this point .	41.77165075783478
But when the gentlemen entered , Jane was no longer the first object .	52.12014670212701
Of what are you talking ?	155.62924080004785
We have heard only once .	120.24446710789256
With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn , and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart .	27.643856436144564
It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl , whom he was violently in love with only a few days before .	19.921034383798357
It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her .	36.10888269527731
Has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style ?	43.16244193326675
he merely answered her question , and read on .	61.61707546760516
If we make haste , said Lydia , as they walked along , perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes .	24.744521201782916
Elizabeth read on ;	172.11334519889817
You will be a very happy woman .	71.52043428885351
the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers' wives , and Elizabeth continued her walk alone , crossing field after field at a quick pace , jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity , and finding herself at last within view of the house , with weary ancles , dirty stockings , and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise .	11.452800601669013
But as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you .	42.808548659389835
Two obstacles of the five being thus removed , Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time , without making any impression on them .	26.67242720339708
but this would be nothing if you really liked him .	49.33747490637886
yes .	728.0810120833138
and really , upon serious consideration , I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter .	27.164444530638352
and her mother was too happy , to be quite so obstinate as usual .	40.27205673921205
though I am sure ( and I do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it , ) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole .	28.529366086261728
and till the evening after the visit was paid , she had no knowledge of it .	30.923296893534065
It is no such thing .	83.72283702788982
Excellent Parsonage House !	170.3161986162319
I hope you have destroyed the letter .	54.95204799847579
She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings , and had sent for him only the Saturday before , to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening .	23.3974588395394
I am sure there is not on his .	47.84279957960696
I am sure we never read the same , or not with the same feelings .	39.826758250767604
Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast .	29.554272271114897
Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them .	49.66672843765577
She felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Wickham , and rejoiced in it .	23.70858501824221
Oh , no !	253.25755517299214
And taking her hand , he would have given it to Darcy , who , though extremely surprised , was not unwilling to receive it , when she instantly drew back , and said with some discomposure to Sir William , Indeed , Sir , I have not the least intention of dancing .	20.819240497002824
She certainly did not hate him .	54.91531503140903
Had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it ;	53.73816089849007
The rapture of Lydia on this occasion , her adoration of Forster , the delight of Bennet , and the mortification of Kitty , are scarcely to be described .	22.950512451910207
I wonder my aunt did not tell us of that .	57.72735265282781
Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage , and when it drove off , Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house .	29.539273926477616
Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , Jane and Kitty followed , but Lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could ;	29.66964541030803
No one made any reply .	121.7092234495532
Bennet wondered at their coming , and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble , and was sure Jane would have caught cold again .	31.732371512161578
and the consciousness of this , was another reason for his resolving to follow us .	31.492834196180482
Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity ?	41.38887823804945
But with such a father and mother , and such low connections , I am afraid there is no chance of it .	23.36344758938836
she has got over the most trying age .	81.75209725778254
the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment ;	27.169213563636056
I think I have heard you say that you know them .	46.19175637963203
but his cousin , after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Collins , sat for some time without speaking to any body .	26.538321144001486
and on this account , as well as some others , found herself , when their visitors left them , capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction , though while it was passing , the enjoyment of it had been little .	21.453533488298838
If Elizabeth , when Darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of its contents .	25.157469032384856
Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours , he had yielded to his brother-in-law's intreaty that he would return to his family , and leave it to him to do , whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit .	17.723479089042456
You may , in fact , carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire , my dear cousin .	30.039433147960658
hopeless of seeing him before .	148.39295576243634
I will put on my things in a moment .	50.334041720833156
Yours , c .	153.9190396338396
You are a good girl ;	115.59138469617022
As soon as they entered , Bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information ;	24.79242211790754
but his perfect indifference , and your pointed dislike , make it so delightfully absurd !	32.449557408595666
Will you hear it ?	145.0683499280855
Society , I own , is necessary to me .	77.33410944966393
I hope not .	151.0170899032699
Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had originated in jealousy , she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her , and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady's side , the acquaintance would now be renewed .	22.723405578869073
Not the slightest .	254.86206616061332
This was a lucky recollection it saved her from something like regret .	42.89404370079162
but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation .	38.07130301387175
How strange must it appear to him !	80.88509678850728
She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man , who , in disposition and talents , would most suit her .	33.74974442066182
I must beg to return to the house .	59.16441044923427
Why , indeed , he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head , as you will hear .	32.941378459728455
On his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him , which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said , Did not you think , Darcy , that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when I was teazing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton ?	22.49002538114029
Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter .	37.455821791006535
The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat , drink , and sleep , and pursue the usual course of their employments .	17.850034944288385
They had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister .	43.79405121413839
She found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable .	34.3598227092862
I congratulate her .	112.13857120490556
In such cases , a woman has not often much beauty to think of .	58.718546662250894
After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity , Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday .	28.26865150573932
There , Bennet .	331.02004019319503
It appears to me so very unlikely , that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless , and who was actually staying in his colonel's family , that I am strongly inclined to hope the best .	17.56984952027912
for , besides the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her .	47.69290827711057
Yes , replied Wickham ;	125.81658569343985
I will have no reserves from you .	56.388661563489634
And now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be ;	36.82790983008289
My aunt , she continued , is going to-morrow into that part of the town , and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor-street .	22.762174972544976
You give me fresh life and vigour .	53.09803422741003
I say no more than the truth , and what every body will say that knows him , replied the other .	30.676012447882506
Her keenest attention was awakened ;	81.20576959352941
She really looked almost wild .	85.43791399406447
Miss De Bourgh was pale and sickly ;	52.76643428779078
Consoled by this resolution , she was the better able to bear her husband's incivility ;	43.561152760359754
There is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us .	35.74469025651566
He is his own master .	100.8424633390113
We live in so different a part of town , all our connections are so different , and , as you well know , we go out so little , that it is very improbable they should meet at all , unless he really comes to see her .	27.51196334638483
I should like it beyond any thing !	57.14616004575491
You shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased .	34.689110130499046
Lady Catherine de Bourgh , she replied , has very lately given him a living .	29.447909119427468
My courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me .	32.47850549024404
I wish you had been there .	70.19519442348788
But to be guarded at such a time , is very difficult .	41.59802852744808
He is perfectly amiable .	113.992121028031
Why , he has four or five thousand a-year , and very likely more .	42.31200542126082
Have you any other objection , said Elizabeth , than your belief of my indifference ?	39.32845763982751
told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her's , and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry .	21.627905140310947
Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth ;	72.67899970014804
He was resolutely silent however ;	69.01367707169436
How can you be smiling so , Lizzy ?	94.6330381539694
who could have done less for her ?	123.56824165422233
The person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund .	20.223434926810576
Well , Lizzy , continued her mother soon afterwards , and so the Collinses live very comfortable , do they ?	35.841124084413735
These parties were acceptable to all ;	106.7137594761823
Upon the whole , therefore , she found , what has been sometimes found before , that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire , did not in taking place , bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself .	24.13725545930821
she made a slight , formal , apology , for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was in every respect so altered a creature , that when she went away , I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer .	24.885683984217785
Gardiner , highly amused by the kind of family prejudice , to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master , soon led again to the subject ;	24.28667571559348
If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield , said Bennet to her husband , and all the others equally well married , I shall have nothing to wish for .	25.375874162347056
It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case .	35.05572069732615
Had he done his duty in that respect , Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle , for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her .	30.00284885561402
and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton .	35.777270211052986
He had some intention , he added , of studying the law , and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein .	20.970468074196734
Lord !	639.3930496104806
I am not equal to it .	60.299455292519205
Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch-street , and repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and herself , which proved that the former had , from her heart , given up the acquaintance .	25.986585964598586
His reception however was of the most flattering kind .	63.89898693305631
Bennet's eyes sparkled .	198.59560053821585
My aunt's intelligence had given me hope , and I was determined at once to know every thing .	36.48675432220992
I cannot think of it without abhorrence .	63.695839813236645
When she was discontented she fancied herself nervous .	49.02791190025882
Yours ever , CAROLINE BINGLEY .	80.30128839688562
I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time .	34.98584853590498
but it will have no effect on me .	64.46170624502618
and between her and Gardiner , with occasional help from Elizabeth , the conversation was carried on .	35.52206325221588
I must go instantly to my mother ;	85.895277474065
He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while .	31.554801181772273
I cannot pretend to be sorry , said Wickham , after a short interruption , that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts ;	21.58083725254158
A man who had felt less , might .	94.63032398541024
B Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark .	51.34054215625968
and when at last Kitty did , she very innocently said , What is the matter mamma ?	33.65128140403423
If my vanity had taken a musical turn , you would have been invaluable , but as it is , I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers .	21.648110374067656
She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together ;	34.97326965689621
She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity , nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct .	25.836335100650082
I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country for my part , except the shops and public places .	28.61724797850379
but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough .	49.524111465521635
my dear , said Maria quite shocked at the mistake , it is not Lady Catherine .	30.4450353306067
When she was only fifteen , there was a gentleman at my brother Gardiner's in town , so much in love with her , that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away .	25.685080508321217
He had to be sure done much .	83.28050567323008
Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback , and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day .	26.481342113302873
But now suppose as much as you chuse ;	68.53101081825204
Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Darcy's progress through his book , as in reading her own ;	34.92065847264082
for Mary , on receiving amongst the thanks of the table , the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute began another .	24.38902495135007
The advice was followed readily , for the feverish symptoms increased , and her head ached acutely .	22.681029755296393
Letters of business too !	172.84927669574824
he was to come there with Wickham , you know .	84.21872251923276
Can you come to-morrow ?	174.67156129352054
And my aunt Philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good , added Kitty .	41.0511761905985
No , Lizzy , let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame .	33.99521923766494
I never heard of such a thing .	56.91115611330151
Are you , indeed ?	172.92200163287754
Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther , and when he ceased , the colour rose into her cheeks , and she said , In such cases as this , it is , I believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however unequally they may be returned .	18.382083687519696
What advantage can it be to you to offend Darcy ?	85.49453773930348
and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again , which I should think exceedingly probable , stay quietly at home , and be satisfied that we shall take no offence .	20.209335535855878
Miss Bingley saw all this likewise ;	85.35278964912763
Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me , because it would be imprudent ;	35.58011032545558
said Miss Bingley ;	223.1897060348712
But his anger , I am persuaded , lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister's sentiments .	29.035608393466966
I knew enough of your disposition to be certain , that , had you been absolutely , irrevocably decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine , frankly and openly .	21.83841263457734
From such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink .	40.3134540309015
Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness .	49.012136096864886
This was exactly as it should be ;	88.06967759073255
Secondly , that I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness ;	49.628152595698815
It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he should .	37.913689746976885
They are young in the ways of the world , and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on , as well as the plain .	20.954959909749093
With the Gardiners , they were always on the most intimate terms .	52.553567197735426
She had a sister married to a Philips , who had been a clerk to their father , and succeeded him in the business , and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade .	21.74372284048372
Never , sir .	244.7016149046782
Dear Lizzy !	389.1888217186901
How near it may be to mine , I cannot pretend to say .	43.7747227326958
for as the others were all going to sit down to cards , she could not be wanted to counteract her mother's schemes .	25.37564783302823
Elizabeth had received none since her return , that could come from Pemberley .	44.176982370383925
Jane was as much gratified by this , as her mother could be , though in a quieter way .	40.80492131167576
The officers of the shire were in general a very creditable , gentleman-like set , and the best of them were of the present party ;	31.794428337670077
It has been my own doing , and I ought to feel it .	33.858236756284406
Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face , and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections .	25.075384255285215
She explained what its effect on her had been , and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed .	27.29212710950444
CHAPTER XVIII .	234.75576465601785
No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth , and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful .	32.34713747154431
Your's , c .	131.1823014200323
You must and shall be married by a special licence .	41.45861132872751
But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them .	38.20172847965784
nor , when we attempt to describe any particular scene , will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation .	32.70694581117386
In this manner Lady Catherine talked on , till they were at the door of the carriage , when turning hastily round , she added , I take no leave of you , Miss Bennet .	24.35987271431165
and Elizabeth , agitated and confused , rather knew that she was happy , than felt herself to be so ;	27.734827435415855
If I had ever learnt , I should have been a great proficient .	39.54764761374983
She is quite a little creature .	81.6000385843363
Bingley does not know Wickham himself ?	96.42437864561391
I would not trust you so near it as East Bourne for fifty pounds !	29.017192153882387
He shall not be in love with me , if I can prevent it .	37.25486321643236
I did not expect it from you .	62.458168873743375
But in matters of greater weight , I may suffer from the want of money .	30.12083018728429
I came to you without a doubt of my reception .	48.74263851560006
Indeed I could not .	139.58041044290763
This is wholly unexpected .	106.96369413867903
and when they parted , after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield , and embracing her most tenderly , she even shook hands with the former .	20.44339784447856
My watchfulness has been effectual ;	61.85160856439706
c .	684.2143304361672
You may readily comprehend , she added , what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and ( comparatively speaking ) a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time .	21.811533777945254
That would be the greatest misfortune of all !	84.6190871000972
And so ended his affection , said Elizabeth impatiently .	55.614143078632246
Against staying longer , however , Elizabeth was positively resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked ;	26.83497501923032
Thank you but I always mend my own .	77.48391627492958
cried Elizabeth .	274.15392210803657
But the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me .	27.621831328836077
Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt's arrival .	42.71321038343013
Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more , and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly , there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity .	22.53389297679545
and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of Lord , how tired I am !	23.545022212501006
She does not yet leave her dressing-room .	58.46934924899311
for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming .	39.15962534898447
Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Bingley .	42.26620023044563
but she found herself considerably useful to both of them , in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur .	28.02182392430667
If there were any one , that one could apply to , with a probability of gaining such a clue as that , it might be of essential consequence .	25.354422587758865
but , however , I hope it is not true .	43.300001659219866
I am sorry it went off .	57.37980611568357
Charles , when you build your house , I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley .	33.58796218498018
She had gained her point , and had time to consider of it .	42.97025461656278
said Elizabeth , still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam .	60.96370308498614
and in his behaviour to me , there were stronger impulses even than pride .	30.95559158677347
Darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said , This walk is not wide enough for our party .	35.62827178846033
She did not choose it , said her daughter , she would go .	39.81196157703903
dear , yes ;	333.37471850189496
I declare I do not know a more aweful object than Darcy , on particular occasions , and in particular places ;	25.123986938002513
he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton .	72.97588116050082
But why all this secrecy ?	89.0362675218256
for he would certainly think the better of me , if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat denial , and ride off as fast as I could .	28.340789714185807
but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement .	36.85648139999358
That is all settled .	135.17036080702235
As the day of his arrival drew near , I begin to be sorry that he comes at all , said Jane to her sister .	33.35245556054913
I wish I could see her .	78.69124988393187
We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance .	24.617363079918164
The colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ;	17.56544908397095
But now that my dear uncle is come , I hope every thing will be well .	38.49437372856713
But , Lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or Jane at most .	41.449669388320835
You had better neglect your relations , than run the risk of offending your patroness .	33.44329070051018
His pride never deserts him ;	96.36288985918192
Yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the t te- -t te was over .	22.73300682413106
but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty .	31.721027281828263
Every park has its beauty and its prospects ;	72.38119434123227
It is , in short , impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them , without actual blame on either side .	21.886969357294234
Oh !	298.0706733468098
She then sat still five minutes longer ;	61.64835209961418
When the dancing recommenced , however , and Darcy approached to claim her hand , Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence .	18.95073864963875
Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ;	43.454919401181684
every sister except Mary agreed to go with her ;	78.25170506407069
You see on what a footing we are .	63.60736203959383
There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds .	42.37629202792029
and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion .	31.81081209376036
she only smiles , I laugh .	114.22473518753557
Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman , not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Bennet .	34.50894441592447
Bennet indeed said little ;	183.07929620801482
Bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county ;	50.2651801454772
Wickham's affection for Lydia , was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it ;	53.22089485971434
Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings ;	54.83984684399249
It is really too distressing .	75.36256595628026
Jane recollected herself soon , and putting the letter away , tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation ;	30.260581063054648
but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures , every idea gave way to the charm of recollection ;	28.742450935947563
How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it !	31.31845488070422
It had better have happened to you , Lizzy ;	80.3261714484458
coming frequently before breakfast , and always remaining till after supper ;	52.57585325859153
Gardiner , who was walking arm in arm with Elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of her wonder .	32.76900152614645
Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once .	53.41961993283682
I hoped to find you reasonable ;	69.12975363350024
and I can never be in company with this Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections .	26.73613020929001
But not long was the interval of tranquillity ;	56.03596818242678
Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him ?	61.80163142303106
and the kindness of the late Darcy , though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his own words .	22.81031102028027
Not so hasty , if you please .	83.29541965552
the latter of whom , however , could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her , in spite of all Miss Bingley's witticisms on fine eyes .	22.546266198604037
They went to the library , therefore , and asked their father , whether he would not wish them to make it known to her .	26.334633539485868
But consider your daughters .	96.49699071444148
and considering Collins's character , connections , and situation in life , I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair , as most people can boast on entering the marriage state .	18.836553106670888
Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts ?	73.94611298113071
said her aunt .	303.64258321883375
said she , I heard you before ;	105.23257076199484
You begin to comprehend me , do you ?	64.92361727097344
As to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , I am not able to judge ;	22.021671540392635
and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way .	56.12310320819828
and her mother , with manners so far from right herself , was entirely insensible of the evil .	26.618821405555096
EDW .	662.9770795749859
and they pursued the accustomed circuit ;	41.65059163236818
that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side , and that if it were , it must belong to Darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance .	29.152546863635195
No really , replied Elizabeth ;	131.1092899375345
but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely , more I think than last year .	43.50883397102729
when I went away , I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again !	31.89615658968898
but , though she could not look , she could listen , and he told her of feelings , which , in proving of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable .	27.145959429141186
and , after standing a few moments without saying a word , he suddenly recollected himself , and took leave .	28.995606676068657
The picture gallery , and two or three of the principal bed-rooms , were all that remained to be shewn .	25.068070967435677
I will read you the passage which particularly hurts me .	36.57123591062187
I am sorry for her , because , with her disposition , she may not get over it immediately .	33.84617931353384
which , as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence , she accordingly read ;	43.6072966112883
that speech savours strongly of disappointment .	70.5298513365241
but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear .	55.676765377345
Perhaps I do .	233.60863013131728
but if he wished to converse with her , he might have better success .	32.54835666263407
It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man .	40.98587522549257
because we shall see the less of him .	102.9244188632041
No indeed ;	365.033353782332
Royalty payments must be paid within <TIME_PERIOD > following each date on which you prepare ( or are legally required to prepare ) your periodic tax returns .	16.330765905736158
Poor little Lizzy !	280.8694963358845
Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county , she was a most active magistrate in her own parish , the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by Collins ;	21.268911121906623
I hope , said she , as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day , you will give your mother-in-law a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her tongue ;	16.781879052451057
We had better not mention it .	114.65208769854596
Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as Bingley had now been gone a week , and nothing was heard of his return .	22.62679371439742
he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune , or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn .	22.016027183118524
She felt anew the justice of Darcy's objections ;	49.44927185184437
and all for the sake of Collins too !	63.45249626179252
but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting .	25.54211968904085
but , however , he did not admire her at all : indeed , nobody can , you know ;	30.316315820529077
Much as I respect them , I believe , I thought only of you .	54.176537510529265
with barefaced questions , ingenious suppositions , and distant surmises ;	27.454777131193087
Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting , that had she chosen it , she might by this time have been presented to her , as her future niece ;	25.07382264971181
Miss Darcy , the daughter of Darcy , of Pemberley , and Lady Anne , could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner .	29.9607853620741
She had turned away , but on hearing herself called , though in a voice which proved it to be Darcy , she moved again towards the gate .	26.64623811732265
She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known ;	40.75254898408129
If I have , I shall be the last person to confess it .	50.57749060940229
She was on the point of continuing her walk , when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park ;	18.690200020247275
To the girls , who could not listen to their cousin , and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument , and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle-piece , the interval of waiting appeared very long .	20.128532309100986
In talking over their route the evening before , Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again .	38.297318705722695
To yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you .	39.505346307571905
It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire , nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay ;	22.975528915022824
and she would , at times , have given any thing to be privileged to tell him , that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family .	25.25851948055771
Not one .	395.3346035604126
said Jane as she finished it .	111.4344715745899
With assumed tranquillity he then replied , I have no wish of denying that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that I rejoice in my success .	21.84648465799139
Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring ?	59.25802123298117
But pride where there is a real superiority of mind , pride will be always under good regulation .	25.90744436622992
thoughtless , thoughtless Lydia !	133.00774641110092
I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness ;	35.23509480672405
With a triumphant smile , they were told , that it was ten miles round .	30.438485307354174
but the gentlemen will have Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton ;	57.958046721255755
You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion , which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty .	21.963510884370425
The necessity must be obeyed and farther apology would be absurd .	28.385789581775068
One of them does .	236.47657543258646
the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy .	62.13363762867719
Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity , and by the middle of June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears ;	18.174447892208764
Now is your time .	237.88205378243154
it was impossible to think of any thing else , and totally indisposed for employment , she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise .	21.958821835457154
They were not the only objects of Collins's admiration .	65.63300723924289
but her own opinion continued the same , and she left him disappointed and sorry .	42.86358818513703
but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal .	23.7926446800687
With a strong prejudice against every thing he might say , she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield .	33.85428803258767
Bingley met them with hopes that Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected .	41.177622160558684
To congratulate myself on the hope of relations , whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ?	31.645067561027172
I write rather slowly .	90.32281374270444
The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge , and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed .	27.48788541645165
This information , however , startled Bennet ;	53.97120014854982
Care of him !	281.3178766493744
It was drawn at the same time as the other about eight years ago .	29.98237019570069
There is , I believe , in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil , a natural defect , which not even the best education can overcome .	30.701488380239706
If !	631.5768698935937
They have a sharp , shrewish look , which I do not like at all ;	32.873862437151125
as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general , was beyond the Collinses' reach .	45.632190781975034
My brother admires her greatly already , he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing , her relations all wish the connection as much as his own , and a sister's partiality is not misleading me , I think , when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman's heart .	20.264970254363217
But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend ;	30.27882386829407
Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile , she said , I did not know before that you ever walked this way .	30.938927028697787
My manners must have been in fault , but not intentionally I assure you .	31.729916777048356
I want to be told whether I ought , or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand Wickham's character .	30.837059880328002
and fearful of its being Darcy , she was directly retreating .	29.342321513007455
Oh !	298.0706733468098
What a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt !	49.59401744395501
No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard .	54.58035816619764
Her mother's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determined not to venture near her , lest she might hear too much .	23.06039362288871
I certainly have not the talent which some people possess , said Darcy , of conversing easily with those I have never seen before .	28.330307102398162
A most welcome negative followed the last question and her alarms being now removed , she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself ;	24.35612673053143
I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship .	27.93761057788607
though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon regained her composure , and calmly replied , Why should you be surprised , my dear Eliza ?	23.862989666813636
While she spoke , an involuntary glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes .	17.6041627254885
Do clear them too , or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody .	33.885132183218616
I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children .	32.234819702896004
After making every possible enquiry on that side London , Colonel F came on into Hertfordshire , anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes , and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield , but without any success , no such people had been seen to pass through .	17.91880331307243
She was no sooner in possession of it , than hurrying into the little copse , where she was least likely to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the benches , and prepared to be happy ;	18.360691119888894
not equal to Lydia's for him .	116.9673245685527
She finds Miss Pope a treasure .	36.263046611156355
but the things should be ordered immediately .	52.54683980105679
I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn ;	48.289297258892816
The rest of the evening brought her little amusement .	47.21556338400082
and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy .	21.04595395050071
I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject , but I will not leave the country without confiding them , and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable .	21.775119450415083
Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings , Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy , calling for every one's congratulations , and laughing and talking with more violence than ever ;	21.38047852214663
She was perfectly sensible that he never had ;	62.89643590780988
till , shaking off his embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the gentlest of accents , You , who so well know my feelings towards Darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right .	21.24143986908254
But the morrow passed off much better than she expected ;	52.531490949972564
He spoke well , but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed , and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride .	21.85116793831257
and , according to the present plan , were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire .	31.769505458458788
I believed you to be wishing , expecting my addresses .	39.58473612031669
His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen , on his returning to Netherfield .	29.058773505599806
but it must be done .	85.53102080959582
I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object .	42.060134030389
But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man , whom they had never seen before , of most gentleman-like appearance , walking with an officer on the other side of the way .	24.278776478101264
He is the best landlord , and the best master , said she , that ever lived .	36.3476128730829
Though it is difficult , said Jane , to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due , the wish is certainly to his credit .	29.912759893279592
I am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose Darcy's regard .	31.101255537882935
Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door , and the carriage stopped at the small gate , which led by a short gravel walk to the house , amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party .	18.604136347128552
We neither of us perform to strangers .	77.56894718661354
He observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ;	25.002849586682082
The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Bennet the next morning , but the post came in without bringing a single line from him .	25.041448359969905
Nothing that she could say , however , had any influence .	56.76892813902739
It is amazing to me , said Bingley , how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished , as they all are .	27.08701618139291
cried he .	420.4789683000624
If he means to be but little at Netherfield , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we might possibly get a settled family there .	28.191326784965028
Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself , but his manners were always so pleasing , that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought , his smiles and his easy address , while he claimed their relationship , would have delighted them all .	26.94333946569404
But my dear Lydia , I don't at all like your going such a way off .	32.81546918008918
E4 .	662.9770795749859
Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves .	22.96761684573991
and a fortnight only was wanting of it , when a letter arrived from Gardiner , which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent .	25.260478973094873
and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening , and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours , Miss Elizabeth , for the two first dances especially , a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her .	15.955764908225282
And there was my aunt , all the time I was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon .	26.179398028547055
It will save me a world of trouble and economy .	46.13716281315885
And what do you think she said besides ?	78.73700361759809
Jane went to him instantly , kissed him , and thanked him for his goodness .	34.74447939944553
and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter , she found little , except the professed affection of the writer , that could give her any comfort .	24.5929538421506
She is on her road somewhere , I dare say , and so passing through Meryton , thought she might as well call on you .	23.330833206180177
After a slight preparation for good news , the letter was read aloud .	44.246051425295654
Oh , yes .	170.79128773115244
From the very beginning , from the first moment I may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form that ground-work of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike ;	19.508465590103437
My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers .	58.34116117810222
Jane will be quite an old maid soon , I declare .	58.254171656931625
Nothing , on the contrary , could be more natural ;	72.2244972914657
Yes ;	506.5076850786652
Elizabeth was shocked to think that , however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself , the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal !	20.28558630185674
It had come with a fare from London ;	61.21658799999895
Then , the two third he danced with Miss King , and the two fourth with Maria Lucas , and the two fifth with Jane again , and the two sixth with Lizzy , and the Boulanger If he had had any compassion for me , cried her husband impatiently , he would not have danced half so much !	17.98548121470928
When breakfast was over , they were joined by the sisters ;	47.235174099441146
She did indeed , Louisa .	83.37188123740903
Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London ;	40.28454085448313
No said Darcy , I have made no such pretension .	53.85958214028264
CHAPTER IV .	223.11563766813362
For , though your accusations were ill-founded , formed on mistaken premises , my behaviour to you at the time , had merited the severest reproof .	23.2004746854972
lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table , after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter ;	27.466785677275148
It was Collins's picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened ;	33.87798415539361
But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities , replied her uncle .	43.714804597552494
Do you not consider that a connection with you , must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody ?	36.925188086498515
My dear Bennet , cried his wife , what are you talking of ?	42.28071721224651
Lydia was a stout , well-grown girl of fifteen , with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance ;	27.423203756393036
It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire .	35.15612672308481
To be sure London was rather thin , but however the little Theatre was open .	47.45420375210028
She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded ;	28.81941556636911
My mother was in hysterics , and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power , I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done !	23.913192130385955
Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room , and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from Bingley by a housemaid , and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters .	19.921636435873392
His revenge would have been complete indeed .	50.80162294270562
I could hardly keep my countenance .	71.80652024615928
Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes .	27.473626690510546
She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent , without remembering that his cousin was to go with him ;	36.718738461910384
Elizabeth's misery increased , at such unnecessary , such officious attention !	63.76113019398674
He resigned all claim to assistance in the church , were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it , and accepted in return three thousand pounds .	21.974865675893525
As for myself , it is many , many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner .	32.61126161453421
That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary ;	42.99103243266321
when she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage , the difference , the change was so great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible .	20.45455354426364
That is all settled ;	153.85617780601612
till the latter walked away from her , and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano-forte , stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's countenance .	20.24041441735355
You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters ;	33.37513813735625
And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself ?	44.956023844463225
I do not blame Jane , she continued , for Jane would have got Bingley , if she could .	28.441830090935937

I am astonished , my dear , said Bennet , that you should be so ready to think your own children silly .	23.685482795604553
The effect was immediate .	105.42332772197503
Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth ;	45.681083173566364
Not that I think Charlotte so very plain but then she is our particular friend .	44.0344339410427
Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine , and his kind intention of christening , marrying , and burying his parishioners whenever it were required .	14.86185878839217
You are quite right .	108.72140051290759
but now , as Bingley's friend and your husband , there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me .	39.47731299916918
Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ;	38.538247081899605
I wish you had been there , my dear , to have given him one of your set downs .	29.631272039399786
but you must own she is very plain .	74.52588596045675
but attended with all that embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior , the belief of her being proud and reserved .	22.24870722330957
In revolving lady Catherine's expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference .	18.808416801106972
With a book he was regardless of time ;	67.56470842830579
Their sister's wedding day arrived ;	114.03421429134842
Wickham began to speak on more general topics , Meryton , the neighbourhood , the society , appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen , and speaking of the latter especially , with gentle but very intelligible gallantry .	20.188947435258964
Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters .	38.80232579149629
This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be ;	33.79574408706182
and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better .	40.29487686295534
though I doubt whether his reserve , or anybody's reserve , can be answerable for the event .	30.334090189185876
In a few days more , we may gain some news of them , and till we know that they are not married , and have no design of marrying , do not let us give the matter over as lost .	23.57853301935028
and I wish with all my heart it may prove so ;	56.684036078208045
The younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done ;	33.81076382111208
And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Forster , the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me .	30.161708055728287
She answered him with cold civility .	78.97534156355445
If , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise , should come to his friend within a few days , she added , I shall know how to understand it .	27.0552632016171
But I will not repine .	66.04819335531387
Bingley will not be detained in London by them .	71.99899095736448
We were always encouraged to read , and had all the masters that were necessary .	40.34845694746576
so far we are equal .	161.60579773968
I was angry perhaps at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper direction .	35.80473889169249
yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet .	48.21879073605422
She burst into tears as she alluded to it , and for a few minutes could not speak another word .	23.61900970193307

and the evening , though as it passed it seemed long , was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion ;	34.0316139914186
for Bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken , and Lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , boisterously exclaimed , Good Lord !	18.62770487524922
Is not it so , Bennet ?	187.2840009529784
and I never saw such happy manners !	71.18923275007903
You will only think I feel more than I ought to do , when I tell you all .	36.643765203172734
We may as well wait , perhaps , till the circumstance occurs , before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon .	30.00187347777912
Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion ( unasked too ) on this subject ;	36.962298804968064
Your examination of Darcy is over , I presume , said Miss Bingley ;	41.25726621342855
He spoke of apprehension and anxiety , but his countenance expressed real security .	39.19149028296935
it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome .	54.27741182549655
You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane .	44.913753527528414
As her successor in that house , she regarded her with jealous abhorrence .	36.832024232823535
But what does he say of the living ?	75.09525955248702
E8 or 1 .	149.18742475670655
Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice , which on every other subject shall be my constant guide , though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself .	20.40767582764722
that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place , and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Morris immediately ;	27.140530517683196
1 .	384.9991185797929
They were more disturbed , more unequal , than she had often seen them .	39.23332452098258
and Darcy had much better finish his letter .	58.059758246718495
It is natural that obligation should be felt , and if I could feel gratitude , I would now thank you .	27.01179472696826
They are going to be encamped near Brighton ;	44.39836555954405
If you have not been mistaken here , I must have been in an error .	40.29219580477577
1 .	384.9991185797929
The rain continued the whole evening without intermission ;	51.43779283036612
You have employed your time much better .	64.92900824360827
She saw all the glories of the camp ;	36.90543852737106
My dear , you flatter me .	66.80791111950633
PRIDE AND PREJUDICE : A Novel .	47.060742847464674
Nobody wants him to come .	128.97736538860673
but she had her share of business as well as her aunt , and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in Lambton , with false excuses for their sudden departure .	19.70455446645959
The church ought to have been my profession I was brought up for the church , and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living , had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now .	21.697923505270136
Let me take it in the best light , in the light in which it may be understood .	32.28619797415004
Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet , and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body , went away .	21.200747026000215
E8 or 1 .	149.18742475670655
thought she .	542.7050558070877
and as that left too short a period for them to go so far , and see so much as they had proposed , or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on , they were obliged to give up the Lakes , and substitute a more contracted tour ;	20.293543129652033
she cried .	402.14084133784803
Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry , but could only force one most reluctant smile .	29.075456035032833
Yes ;	506.5076850786652
I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind .	26.066879503989956
said she .	372.7761627948212
The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence , or frightened by his high and imposing manners , and sees him only as he chuses to be seen .	20.745451931833095
I advise Darcy , and Lizzy , and Kitty , said Bennet , to walk to Oakham Mount this morning .	19.37004910202384
and immediately , though not very fluently , gave him to understand , that her sentiments had undergone so material a change , since the period to which he alluded , as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure , his present assurances .	23.390267333818436
To the rest of the family they paid little attention ;	59.42052086734495
That they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice !	28.292309162356307
For my part , I am inclined to believe it all Darcy's , but you shall do as you chuse .	41.829711773350866
She was met in the vestibule by Lydia , who , flying to her , cried in a half whisper , I am glad you are come , for there is such fun here !	23.423244563538066
But enough of this .	130.15027274295335
Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's interruption , and promised that it should not occur again , if he would resume his book ;	24.510972289356232
She was still very poorly , and Elizabeth would not quit her at all , till late in the evening , when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep , and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself .	20.44177147850799
This he considered sufficient encouragement , and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her , immediately followed .	31.17771691304288
She was a little revived , however , by his bringing back his coffee cup himself ;	24.25087488426768
Except , thought Elizabeth , when she goes to Ramsgate .	48.63663204146177
Can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand ?	70.0658512828104
Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday ;	44.67847125071656
But now she would no longer conceal from her , his share in Lydia's marriage .	38.92699281465044
yes it would be much better to wait till Jane was well , and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again .	32.41714449643017
It was too early in the morning for visitors , and besides , the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours .	25.474227026782692
and however bare of news the country in general might be , they always contrived to learn some from their aunt .	33.0014704969655
and their mother talked on , of her dislike of Darcy , and her resolution to be civil to him only as Bingley's friend , without being heard by either of them .	26.501081275715293
for on entering that place they removed into a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom .	29.3410364864535
The loo table , however , did not appear .	35.77699697241673
which brought them again , after some time , in a descent among hanging woods , to the edge of the water , in one of its narrowest parts .	21.51681537212246
and the other , how I am ever to pay him .	46.4627709234465
but when the servants were withdrawn , he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest , and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine , by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness .	22.16491346220273
You know , sister , we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it .	41.15335302898736
He readily agreed to it .	90.74535201013134
I am afraid you will not be able to make it out , but I hardly know what I have written .	23.554885945972295
She will be married at sixteen !	78.80492897939625
and she was , in fact , almost engrossed by her nephews , speaking to them , especially to Darcy , much more than to any other person in the room .	24.88646001824519
But you will know it , when I have told you what happened the very next day .	39.97736935963119
Lady Catherine , Sir William , and and Collins sat down to quadrille ;	29.609185074905984
Another day I will do the same ;	124.27773973650363
Be assured , my dear Sir , that Collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you , and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the bitterest kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove .	23.530560231243093
It is from my cousin , Collins , who , when I am dead , may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases .	25.720284786788753
Oh !	298.0706733468098
I am by no means of opinion , I assure you , said he , that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ;	21.501766967107457
Adieu to disappointment and spleen .	89.70118015459833
Let her go then .	210.73303626717419
He concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which , in spite of all his endeavours , he had found impossible to conquer ;	22.53333546713768
The sanguine hope of good , however , which the benevolence of her heart suggested , had not yet deserted her ;	26.16166355764147
but unable to waste such a precious occasion , she suddenly got up , and saying to Kitty , Come here , my love , I want to speak to you , took her out of the room .	16.203532604418534
Now and then , they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship , and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits .	25.927452568204934
I am perfectly ready , I assure you , to keep my engagement ;	34.561428555107156
and Bingley's large fortune , the mention of which gave animation to their mother , was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign .	21.726271905967703
If , as I conclude will be the case , you send me full powers to act in your name , throughout the whole of this business , I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement .	20.803606684939567
If you mention my name at the Bell , you will be attended to .	32.814609439434484
and Collins having been in waiting near the lodges , to make them his parting obeisance , was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence , of their appearing in very good health , and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected , after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings .	19.948293574682573
Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all , and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet , with great pleasure .	33.298044557658194
and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing her into Derbyshire , had been the means of uniting them .	19.212037315938016
I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies ( if such young ladies there are ) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time .	18.365257414469518
Vanity and pride are different things , though the words are often used synonimously .	46.23919697633869
CHAPTER VI .	223.11563766813362
and I think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all , and very hypocritical .	34.085216606616875
I only hope they may have half my good luck .	54.318224232453225
For though elated by his rank , it did not render him supercilious ;	31.71513799703409
You and the girls may go , or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better , for as you are as handsome as any of them , Bingley might like you the best of the party .	31.942226560115294
Her prudent mother , occupied by the same ideas , forbore to invite him to sit by herself .	21.93061023374391
He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship , replied Elizabeth with emphasis , and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life .	23.07281103259031
stay where you are .	206.37394959768423
Pray , my dear aunt , what is the difference in matrimonial affairs , between the mercenary and the prudent motive ?	23.469534385371222
and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long , that even Bingley's good humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone .	25.038944202235516
But now it comes out .	90.68689754730684
she comes here to-morrow with him .	99.66115821215746
Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us .	48.9148832648457
cried Elizabeth when she had finished it .	64.41399682156187
In understanding Darcy was the superior .	110.37877606430436
Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend , that had attended her from that part of the world .	30.503023152558622
the ladies drove on , and the others returned into the house .	57.20822270502746
My dear aunt , this is being serious indeed .	47.64958666188147
but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him .	42.48256797604437
Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding ;	52.09746141891271
Elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to confirm his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself ;	21.733195097435463
When Denny , and Wickham , and Pratt , and two or three more of the men came in , they did not know him in the least .	25.37630753191708

her features , though not plain , were insignificant ;	80.30636977279231
their father was in neither ;	199.31943414968595
But against this , there were objections ;	69.90325916564922
Darcy was almost as far from her , as the table could divide them .	44.34829433909655
But she is very young ;	125.21508197446639
but was too angry with Lydia , to send any message to her .	44.77062511746516
but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody ;	25.187327654561173
Bingley was by no means deficient , but Darcy was clever .	52.17677764051513
The introduction , however , was immediately made ;	61.44793256264194
You must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention ;	33.247232202329414
Nothing could console and nothing appease her .	73.54413184266964
Bingley .	736.2209741953596
At present I will say nothing about it .	69.80550722697454
but what could set you off in the first place ?	60.85963019022309
but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane ;	28.604277775760057
The loss of her daughter made Bennet very dull for several days .	39.27633454228179
and , while examining the nearer aspect of the house , all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned .	26.608349957286766
several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle , a private had been flogged , and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married .	26.334113640227844
and to her it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first , and was in a way to be very much in love ;	23.452700239295748
There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name .	36.08785383148093
In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ;	23.303068700408936
she cried : This is delightful indeed !	83.89393606373353
In town I believe he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence , and being now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and dissipation .	22.559255161030872
said she , as she looked in her face .	90.1518251221276
This fine account of him , whispered her aunt , as they walked , is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend .	27.039547088528913
Young women should always be properly guarded and attended , according to their situation in life .	34.095443891107635
not deficient in good humour when they were pleased , nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it ;	32.4113302259745
Complied with !	365.1946028050214
Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey , and as she did not answer them all herself , attention was necessary , which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her ;	21.942483646617998
but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters .	44.244581383557986
are quite well .	311.7349813235266
Oh !	298.0706733468098
I grieve to find , however , that Colonel F is not disposed to depend upon their marriage ;	24.021254440539938
and if I had my will , we should .	76.9294655264683
Why will you think so ?	183.41557991013286
and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on the renewal of his addresses .	20.142693674245084
I might as well enquire , replied she , why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ?	24.00845014823995
I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here .	24.69254670330286
who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister , and gratified my vanity , in useless or blameable distrust .	27.405372025732245
Jane heard them with horror .	140.27222008473262
My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family , and if my manner has been at all reprehensible , I here beg leave to apologise .	21.807348698986473
She enquired into Charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly and minutely , and gave her a great deal of advice , as to the management of them all ;	19.338851826358837
I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party .	31.96021712040359
Attention , forbearance , patience with Darcy , was injury to Wickham .	41.032992470588546
and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must produce , found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business .	20.991503791035797
so genteel and so easy !	187.02058634120127
Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to the piano-forte , and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way , which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived , she seated herself .	21.912200015094967
Oh !	298.0706733468098
Though Lydia's short letter to F gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green , something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W never intended to go there , or to marry Lydia at all , which was repeated to Colonel F who instantly taking the alarm , set off from B intending to trace their route .	16.323202702408956
She stared , coloured , doubted , and was silent .	33.77458278090061
and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person ( Lady Lucas ) freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Bingley .	23.751705724842296
I , who have valued myself on my abilities !	52.38878443135829
I wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind .	31.270786585279613
He was seriously concerned , that a cause of so little advantage to any one , should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law , and he was determined , if possible , to find out the extent of his assistance , and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could .	17.535748252217797
She will make him a very proper wife .	67.31189185469484
But depend upon it , Collins , she added , that Lizzy shall be brought to reason .	26.499044281589715
He comes down on Thursday at the latest , very likely on Wednesday .	36.674824982259494
Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is .	40.13578548345797
What do you think has happened this morning ?	78.02240691493499
She was gone directly .	109.68854600193015
Elizabeth was forced to go .	77.22937189908072
and when your sister is recovered , you shall if you please name the very day of the ball .	37.10678858748347
and Darcy , after looking at her for a moment , turned silently away .	35.20515111301786
He was full of joy and attention .	52.05517158411477
He looked serious as usual ;	107.81197166335339
nay , which has already arisen from it , I am sure you would judge differently in the affair .	30.465142331698907
Lydia laughed , and said , Aye , that is just like your formality and discretion .	36.50187247832616
Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister ;	31.432696977042042
In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man !	44.821450237134755
When all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at Pemberley ;	43.85050236516994
Yes ;	506.5076850786652
As soon as Jane had read Gardiner's hope of Lydia's being soon married , her joy burst forth , and every following sentence added to its exuberance .	26.496183148672287
Jane's temper was not desponding , and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart .	23.9447132797022
We may as well leave them by themselves you know ;	70.2791125680767
Elizabeth replied that it was .	108.75804479350315
The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning ;	58.703010685744246
any thing was a welcome relief to him at Rosings ;	71.47327191092896
Much more rational , my dear Caroline , I dare say , but it would not be near so much like a ball .	27.950129003518477
What do you mean ?	129.15994741633747
However , I did not hear above one word in ten , for I was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear Wickham .	36.129936428277425
A carat character is used to denote superscription .	34.05595831576538
He has not an ill-natured look .	86.49158001188638
What could your ladyship propose by it ?	82.47398269492906
In Three Volumes .	99.42297781597165
with tears and lamentations of regret , invectives against the villanous conduct of Wickham , and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage ;	19.5138502973957
They insist also on my seeing Jones therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me and excepting a sore-throat and head-ache there is not much the matter with me .	22.24142006343548
But such as they were , it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them , and what a contrariety of emotion they excited .	25.296724896729042
Jane had not been gone long before it rained hard .	58.07485060768567
but I am sure I never saw any thing of it .	35.19241756956279
Reynolds's respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master .	33.53040792790265
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ?	62.859521559848694
They saw much to interest , but nothing to justify enquiry .	48.32270891993772
cried Miss Bingley .	193.5957050002331
but she did weep from vexation and envy .	42.00779320998195
Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight .	78.50836615288566

Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister .	53.991772691860454
and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle , so I was determined he should know it , and so I let down the side glass next to him , and took off my glove , and let my hand just rest upon the window frame , so that he might see the ring , and then I bowed and smiled like any thing .	18.215893445356027
I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression .	29.729346995366566
Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish , self reproach , she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness .	22.52644908733366
but as he took up his abode with the Lucases , his arrival was no great inconvenience to Bennet .	37.26678250213114
Lady Catherine then observed , Your father's estate is entailed on Collins , I think .	27.66742209642936
Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort ;	28.1354683059926
Collins has made an offer to Lizzy , and she will not have him .	45.899119722647136
I think there cannot be too little said on the subject .	45.42449690904455
and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Darcy's looks and behaviour .	26.92547139824903
and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her .	29.956639165507056
I thank you for explaining it so fully .	46.14256665174473
She cared for none of her friends , she wanted no help of his , she would not hear of leaving Wickham .	27.756224115695503
Thank Heaven !	252.35407186726488
YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION , THE TRADEMARK OWNER , AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL , DIRECT , INDIRECT , CONSEQUENTIAL , PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE .	3.9438378133774354
but he will vouch for the good conduct , the probity and honour of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that Wickham has deserved much less attention from Darcy than he has received ;	24.526951193655854

That is not very likely ;	119.84230871305165
At present I will not say more , but perhaps when we are better acquainted He was interrupted by a summons to dinner ;	32.46496987682562
But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill .	39.705067244704544
one , that Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief ;	58.17869034124552
Elizabeth , after slightly surveying it , went to a window to enjoy its prospect .	36.57167047837093
What can be the meaning of this !	81.35643169916762
What is Darcy to me , pray , that I should be afraid of him ?	38.45815246867237
I assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town .	36.260385305973976
Obstinate , headstrong girl !	123.21367018565519
for certainly , there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction .	54.472321753383355
It now first struck her , that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage , and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings , in the absence of more eligible visitors .	18.562213046896986
Certainly not ;	384.1270990776311
You could not make me happy , and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who would make you so .	28.840172266106897
Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice .	50.877861827209344
The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information , was as sincere as her brother's in sending it .	29.44442106014197
I thank you for my share of the favour , said Elizabeth ;	32.65215192681884
I have nothing either to hope or fear , and nothing to reproach him with .	39.91184528956511
At present I am not in love with Wickham ;	60.92609530368391
It is only that he has better means of having it than many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor .	27.214462853285983
and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked Darcy before they had known any thing of the matter .	27.132763689857935
but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them .	33.89674778238739
I have by no means done .	58.5430145178844
That is not an unnatural surmise , said Fitzwilliam , but it is lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly .	20.450290557896256
all that his library afforded .	190.36569521294112
The commendation bestowed on him by Reynolds was of no trifling nature .	45.13949661753134
You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them .	33.93041160343884
But let me advise you to think better of it .	43.71027431543459
You excel so much in the dance , Miss Eliza , that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you ;	26.07574023634921
MY DEAR BROTHER , At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece , and such as , upon the whole , I hope will give you satisfaction .	24.143205688635483
Thank you , said Lydia , for if you did , I should certainly tell you all , and then Wickham would be angry .	33.54046342620386
In Three Volumes .	99.42297781597165
I know no harm of her .	61.83991790481302
Then , who taught you ?	118.89954783512682
I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary .	43.12419401953568
and though he belonged to one of the universities , he had merely kept the necessary terms , without forming at it any useful acquaintance .	21.460993645874865
He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily postponed seeing him , till after the departure of the former .	20.750936833181598
Such a charming man !	143.7432697336144
His pride , said Miss Lucas , does not offend me so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it .	25.236527865232944
thought Elizabeth .	550.0803560819902
In a few minutes , Bennet half opened the door and called out , Lizzy , my dear , I want to speak with you .	24.839198947893617
But Lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me .	37.88043149464312
You may depend upon my seeking no further .	39.70658710420487
but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Philips , and was , by her watchfulness , most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin .	20.842026345003585
As yet , she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its reasonableness .	37.812703806575485
I should as soon call her mother a wit .	51.029845077169306
We will be down as soon as we can , said Jane ;	55.16532674087459
This must be the grossest falsehood !	66.98339040608292
Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before , how many years longer Bennet was likely to live ;	30.141027809074185
Collins then returned to Elizabeth .	147.55614294206742
Yes ;	506.5076850786652
Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene , and could observe the three ladies before her composedly .	33.10652408370122
and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Collins , was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house , as soon as Bennet were dead .	17.80243710620746
And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother ?	81.40769674727986
Miss Eliza Bennet , said Miss Bingley , despises cards .	33.21711159903989
that as to fortune , it is a most eligible match ;	56.172603477598415
and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister's , Wickham is by no means a respectable young man .	28.242012043834308
Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour , till Sir William thus began .	16.769450571623985
What could be more natural than his asking you again ?	74.08862155047566
Certain it is , that the living became vacant two years ago , exactly as I was of an age to hold it , and that it was given to another man ;	31.05994325513894
I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh , and of her mother Lady Catherine .	19.19809846883812
Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition .	56.478022099619515
I shall send this by express , that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer .	32.208571687839395
He is certainly a good brother , said Elizabeth , as she walked towards one of the windows .	32.099808612210275
If you'll believe me , I did not once put my foot out of doors , though I was there a fortnight .	23.80802576810851
And it is the more to be lamented , because there is reason to suppose , as my dear Charlotte informs me , that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter , has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence , though , at the same time , for the consolation of yourself and Bennet , I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an enormity , at so early an age .	17.11233611527353
and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn , and of her stay in Derbyshire , so often , and in so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts .	24.632623932745236
but at the same time , there was no one , whose knowledge of a sister's frailty would have mortified her so much .	25.053790955999443
My father and mother believe the worst , but I cannot think so ill of him .	40.99079403428909
Wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we have thought him ;	59.852986287325805
Ten thousand pounds !	128.21324430770687
I do assure you , Sir , that I have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man .	18.294269821750763
But as to your other objection , I am afraid it will hardly hold good .	40.08343784963921
Yet now I must believe you , cried Jane .	90.68738144909118
and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself .	42.34016113824107
She has no money , no connections , nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for ever .	34.46110443948325
In seeing Bingley , her thoughts naturally flew to her sister ;	53.838728685831306
Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match ;	72.82581210086357
A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood , since you went away .	32.644090369566456
I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude ;	38.76722738373604
and though Philips , as well as her sister , stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good humour encouraged , yet , whenever she did speak , she must be vulgar .	17.606697180507762
Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family , they did not attempt to oppose it , for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants , while they waited at table , and judged it better that one only of the household , and the one whom they could most trust , should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject .	16.31173764074576
It was only said , 'Lately , George Wickham , Esq .	25.38912613293711
It will be her turn soon to be teazed , said Miss Lucas .	41.170351773566935
Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one ;	49.78267434047158
We accordingly went and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend , the certain evils of such a choice .	25.480277188939997
Indeed he has no improper pride .	98.71666677441597
and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane , and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do .	24.610044754906493
There is something a little stately in him to be sure , replied her aunt , but it is confined to his air , and is not unbecoming .	25.010064036609176
By Elizabeth's instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband , which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself .	25.463896491806373
From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent .	86.88370013332332
I shall not say that you are mistaken , he replied , because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ;	23.709761046342862
Blame you !	358.58822040892244
She will be married !	110.26527036131566
Is he married or single ?	143.06848687765415
but she sat down , resolving within herself , to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man .	19.70812108907667
And with regard to the resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the former were excited by his marrying me , it would not give me one moment's concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn .	20.00419619525222
She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject , and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect .	27.359276558734766
The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister , will prove what she felt .	40.516489841282116
I am the less surprised at what has happened , replied Sir William , from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire .	26.449579669392172
If you are redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase Project Gutenberg associated with or appearing on the work , you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1 .	14.884459265589818
I did not think Caroline in spirits , were her words , but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London .	21.451658437214977
That reply will do for the present .	99.20937721041088
But , unluckily for her ladyship , its effect had been exactly contrariwise .	30.91384598169685
Their parties abroad were less varied than before ;	60.01511107715036
The indirect boast ;	92.85414976499443
Till I was in Kent , and saw so much both of Darcy and his relation , Colonel Fitzwilliam , I was ignorant of the truth myself .	28.99220241649613
cried Elizabeth .	274.15392210803657
YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE , STRICT LIABILITY , BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1 .	5.0330719747397685
But she had no reason to fear and Gardiner's curiosity ;	48.42531087328129
Collins , however , was not discouraged from speaking again , and Darcy's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech , and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way .	16.893460511272934
but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley's inattention .	40.70433042180562
Presuming , however , that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment , than any dislike of the proposal , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of society , a perfect willingness to accept it , she ventured to engage for her attendance , and the day after the next was fixed on .	17.112395395040185
Indeed , Eliza , you will be as welcome to me as either of them .	39.88035090010014
for on the very morning after their own arrival at Lambton , these visitors came .	45.43302767235321
This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ;	35.285263258977984
safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune .	84.63282289649074
What is your own opinion ?	150.4871985317186
and Bennet , who could by no means wish for so speedy a return , immediately said , But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here , my good sir ?	22.06266540800648
He meant to provide for me amply , and thought he had done it ;	31.79665582627587
To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew ;	33.680233626680256
If I were not afraid of judging harshly , I should be almost tempted to say , that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this .	21.765256938489102
And , my dear Jane , I never saw you look in greater beauty .	39.71635544869827
His misfortunes !	293.9925894254027
The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt .	31.59644510434426
and had this led to no suspicion , the faces of both as they hastily turned round , and moved away from each other , would have told it all .	22.446042367625996
6 .	662.9770795749859
How much I shall have to tell !	123.77683405256633
and whatever he did , done gracefully .	54.35799715702875
It was a large , well-proportioned room , handsomely fitted up .	24.446108548392896
She sat intently at work , striving to be composed , and without daring to lift up her eyes , till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister , as the servant was approaching the door .	18.7139002166727
They entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds ;	19.175454961220257
but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome .	31.771836302988735
A place too , with which so many of your acquaintance are connected .	61.67672091478556
and in spite of every thing , was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune .	28.417425478461052
Take care , Lizzy ;	213.07133475330826
And this , said she , is the end of all his friend's anxious circumspection !	41.13548156502349
for that will have more weight in the argument , Miss Bennet , than you may be aware of .	36.825485361301055
assuring him that Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ;	35.60686637798092
when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet , she turned suddenly towards him and said , By the bye , Charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield ?	26.435714240928696
She looked at Jane , to see how she bore it ;	39.994432601133944
I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which I am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before .	21.484768322137803
If one could but go to Brighton !	87.956862796407
and Elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject .	38.68917439696214
She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley .	40.997767335971815
the gentlemen being out , they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere .	59.073266460527826
Gardiner , to whom the chief of this news had been given before , in the course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with her , made her sister a slight answer , and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation .	23.751447248839778
Let me write for you , said Jane , if you dislike the trouble yourself .	38.99489848401333
The happiness which this reply produced , was such as he had probably never felt before ;	43.139670548288805
And , above all things , keep Bennet from fighting .	48.83094720391701
Oh !	298.0706733468098
I never heard any harm of her ;	53.11277276084235
By supposing such an affection , you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong , and me most unhappy .	29.032068537317702
I can recal nothing worse .	61.7179596636794
Their lodgings were not long a secret , and at length they began to know the officers themselves .	40.21194080704762
I like her appearance , said Elizabeth , struck with other ideas .	34.134584628354844
We had better go into the avenue .	66.0564758004484
I am prodigiously proud of him .	47.437082839498984
and it was not wholly without foundation .	49.71600884647248
Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune , which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day .	25.521864812713094
Those who chose to be idle , certainly might .	51.67261681470467
You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble ;	25.915070079726878
To Jane herself , she exclaimed , there could be no possibility of objection .	40.259298400730536
It was all conjecture .	96.43400528618713
Elizabeth merely curtseyed to him , without saying a word .	48.43030579275228
You taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous .	32.62398674181454
but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected .	43.27935360462434
and nothing therefore remained to be done , but to think well of them both , to defend the conduct of each , and throw into the account of accident or mistake , whatever could not be otherwise explained .	20.458990251742215
What is there of good to be expected ?	99.85763942495156
It is what every body says .	66.58305780805324
Every body is disgusted with his pride .	79.26080608637987
said her sister .	261.01119017209106
and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield , I should probably be off in five minutes .	29.469837146813532
adding , that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it .	30.1923940309095
When I am in company with him , I will not be wishing .	41.754124116735795
His surprise was great .	163.8962088605648
and they have another , who lives somewhere near Cheapside .	42.67736174746487
At length , however , his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family .	29.008740664040843
Of a fine , stout , healthy love it may .	53.23391747603185
She remembered also , that till the Netherfield family had quitted the country , he had told his story to no one but herself ;	28.591823281232
I am not ashamed of having been mistaken or , at least , it is slight , it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters .	24.984933111421313
She shall hear my opinion .	98.92730806557816
It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ;	33.262999788111536
I am far from attributing any part of Bingley's conduct to design , said Elizabeth ;	23.97717285215164
The second began .	145.2292943489099
This is a wretched beginning indeed !	71.72267013471838
a favourite with her mother , whose affection had brought her into public at an early age .	49.34874474920734
I am so happy .	94.71403868440159
He stood by her , however , for some minutes , in silence ;	43.61082834900561
She will be taken good care of .	58.542864106350045
I should like to know how he behaves among strangers .	36.53047151614899
Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Wickham .	34.25987776183627
Yes certainly .	394.47454473636594
Your's , c .	131.1823014200323
Poor dear child !	264.541534833451
Your sister I also watched .	126.773857645251
The sisters , on hearing this , repeated three or four times how much they were grieved , how shocking it was to have a bad cold , and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves ;	22.571727575673066
For the last week they had seen very little of either Lady Catherine or her daughter .	49.782624702312496
If that had been nearer , she would not have gone so soon .	48.99551541083848
It is nearly fifty miles .	54.76693188857629
Seriously , however , she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's concurrence .	30.864338846750513
Very , very much .	254.27148924778126
Charlotte did not stay much longer , and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard .	36.60323456026879
for as to Darcy's using him ill , it is perfectly false ;	49.896793108673045
Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit , but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it .	27.578070414979575
A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant ;	26.492896201265633
and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects .	39.60968497577786
Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think , without feeling that she had been blind , partial , prejudiced , absurd .	30.013184225900442
She was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when .	29.692852602801153
Her affections had been continually fluctuating , but never without an object .	36.64774926138072
You are joking , Lizzy .	75.34126419305342
You dislike an argument , and want to silence this .	41.00219028871686
Darcy , who was leaning against the mantle-piece with his eyes fixed on her face , seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise .	24.326428320180387
My dear Madam , he replied , this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what I have been hoping to receive ;	27.080241927935543
Ring the bell , Kitty , for Hill .	59.51422448676308
He was always to have gone on Saturday , and to Saturday he still meant to stay .	36.188607584678756
Believe me , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that your modesty , so far from doing you any disservice , rather adds to your other perfections .	27.005408697281126
The gentlemen arrived early ;	115.65263343010143
How is such a man to be worked on ?	54.757267366285355
Merely to the illustration of your character , said she , endeavouring to shake off her gravity .	26.659195134572627
and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned , and preparing her to be surprised , she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Darcy and herself .	20.024118061628055
but I am afraid of alarming you be assured that we are all well .	33.56865552693124
I am , said he , with a firm voice .	42.87699473701029
Let her be called down .	164.6037657280001
It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first .	25.215196317825406
Removed !	662.9770795749859
In the first place , she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter ;	31.666254626336457
My dear , dear Lydia !	91.25253971417386
Impossible .	752.6775965577506
Reynolds could interest her on no other point .	98.62772295407065
Is this , thought Elizabeth , meant for me ?	77.2666691095343
and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves , and meanly of others .	28.72767789469198
and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration of her , of her former favourite George Wickham ;	23.056786234883667
He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate , generous heart in the world ;	29.42210623016967
and after observing that he was a very gentleman-like man , asked her how she had liked him .	24.72101101682534
To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either .	45.16784193765309
Do you play and sing , Miss Bennet ?	53.128925970401355
No principle of either , would be violated by my marriage with Darcy .	45.208858282068924
You will be censured , slighted , and despised , by every one connected with him .	27.183214193367586
Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural ;	28.459187810898914
Aye , so it is , cried her mother , and Long does not come back till the day before ;	31.58230541805103
With all my heart ;	189.76258014032572
on his side even more .	191.2621554425462
Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality , especially on Lydia's side , but nothing to give him any alarm .	30.397012639379433
His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage , for Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane , in order to have the earliest assurance of it ;	21.813452610003356
But she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow .	55.199348033478145
my last letter had never reached her .	111.61666645968411
I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford .	30.922900337908263
Oh , my dear Lizzy !	88.51920522809357
He was well , but so much engaged with Darcy , that they scarcely ever saw him .	34.65492319752097
but , instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to Miss Bennet , I beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so I took the liberty of coming to ask .	18.860985587916943
but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic .	41.80467449147098
for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement , they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning , from all those who were not immediately on the spot .	27.009384251429463
After pausing on this point a considerable while , she once more continued to read .	46.403920182974495
and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her .	39.29751646575127
Her own thoughts were employing her .	72.91236257130633
1 .	384.9991185797929
and his attachment to Wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me , to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow , and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant .	20.812491826183475
Mary would not understand them ;	146.2341420513541
The situation of your mother's family , though objectionable , was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently , so almost uniformly betrayed by herself , by your three younger sisters , and occasionally even by your father .	20.526989185107464
The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Bennet's visit , and determining when they should ask him to dinner .	20.864810344643697
The country is a vast deal pleasanter , is not it , Bingley ?	42.53050283200178
I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man , without having a wish beyond it .	26.806658843821594
and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct , who will believe me ?	24.147692960037666
Smiles decked the face of Bennet , as the carriage drove up to the door ;	36.38868979784422
When convinced on that article , Miss Bennet had nothing farther to wish .	52.77384809022704
and Bennet , in the meanwhile , was giving way to all the happy schemes , which the good humour , and common politeness of Bingley , in half an hour's visit , had revived .	20.070163936622126
But her conclusion was false ;	83.46235731458509
yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Gardiner thought of him , and Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's beginning the subject .	23.961832594076267
No , she would go home .	88.57086792767207
No , never .	205.8578970748932
He is a pleasant fellow , and would jilt you creditably .	31.128840663426487
Jane had been a week in town , without either seeing or hearing from Caroline .	47.56297408075702
for though feeling almost secure , and with reason , for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging , he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday .	21.89878597112905
Well , then supposing them to be in London .	55.217866353585926
Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related .	73.26631145644744
The apothecary came , and having examined his patient , said , as might be supposed , that she had caught a violent cold , and that they must endeavour to get the better of it ;	20.32022022751362
Teazing , teazing , man !	112.11183956051488
and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Wickham's attentions .	38.035463939358564
I was right , therefore ;	104.35248109413212
I pity you , Miss Eliza , for this discovery of your favourite's guilt ;	33.241527167816685
and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see .	38.53817012938208
They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday ;	60.9959069142987
It was exactly a scene , and exactly among people , where he had apparently least to do , and least temptation to go .	22.413254240426348
The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade , and within view of his own warehouses , could have been so well bred and agreeable .	21.544451579235464
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule .	32.50586985390992
My mind however is now made up on the subject , for having received ordination at Easter , I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh , widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh , whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish , where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship , and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church of England .	11.152320932142361
No ;	670.778131953586
I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude .	29.052348215574845
The general prejudice against Darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton , to attempt to place him in an amiable light .	24.25035538410599
and as for Purvis Lodge , the attics are dreadful .	30.758211113127203
When Bennet was told of this , she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected , considering what her anxiety for his life had been before .	29.53284735896241
He spoke of it as a certain event , of which the time alone could be undecided .	43.961574475331204
Elizabeth soon observed , and instantly understood it .	55.270971524441165
But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness , is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging .	25.471861909302294
You are too hasty , Sir , she cried .	50.476796908427666
What do you keep winking at me for ?	60.86210419790552
On the very last day of the regiment's remaining in Meryton , he dined with others of the officers at Longbourn ;	32.5352938895884
Wickham of course wanted more than he could get ;	92.0126526681625
Elizabeth was glad of it ;	106.15177161955698
she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes ;	87.16721347507941
but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry .	48.624534785591436
However little Darcy might have liked such an address , he contented himself with coolly replying , that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned , no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer .	19.789350260895578
and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too !	47.46658506989884
but the ladies were ready enough to talk , and Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement , nor inclined to be silent himself .	26.11545352682805
said Jane .	432.6607428011162
You are very cautious , I suppose , as to its being created .	35.31918925748876
The feelings of the person who wrote , and the person who received it , are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circumstance attending it , ought to be forgotten .	21.116970062501686
My dearest Lizzy will , I am sure , be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment , at my expence , when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me .	21.707251645889627
though we can never be what we once were to each other .	58.502290607904655
in looking back to what they had feared , only two hours ago , she felt all the advantages of what they had gained .	38.7925566389149
Console Lady Catherine as well as you can .	65.92885452807809
Lizzy , said her father , I have given him my consent .	44.78211790200163
But good lord !	109.00486225614374
Hate you !	358.58822040892244
I pity , though I cannot help blaming her .	47.48130992487435
He left Netherfield for London , on the day following , as you , I am certain , remember , with the design of soon returning .	27.133043960135662
His sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own ;	45.10439109064973
Darcy was fixed in astonishment .	119.86842075125399
But slyness seems the fashion .	58.999700808864674
Are you quite sure , Ma'am ?	77.71135474226125
As I did the other day , said Elizabeth , with a conscious smile ;	46.18770528888868
And is such a girl to be my nephew's sister ?	53.23592439618529
His anxiety for Jane was evident , and his attentions to herself most pleasing , and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others .	25.221442731071267
What I have to say relates to poor Lydia .	59.49150999482358
and though her resolution was not to be shaken , her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation .	31.50272892677109
Pray go to see them , with Sir William and Maria .	58.51948425078629
The only pain was in leaving her father , who would certainly miss her , and who , when it came to the point , so little liked her going , that he told her to write to him , and almost promised to answer her letter .	25.039778583483795
My dear Bennet , replied his wife , how can you be so tiresome !	38.32951983626258
Affectation of candour is common enough ;	78.76237313253988
of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt .	83.36596190051735
He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him , to lay his private actions open to the world .	18.799677397416175
The whole party have left Netherfield by this time , and are on their way to town ;	38.9529313241253
I know it to be impossible .	72.14272551774033
I have written to Colonel Forster , to inform him of our present arrangements , and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Wickham in and near Brighton , with assurances of speedy payment , for which I have pledged myself .	17.41663045901073
What , has she frightened away some of your lovers ?	68.1408350985491
You have no compassion on my poor nerves .	50.20508306370751
She wanted to hear of him , when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence .	34.37631247385304
Are not you curious to hear how it was managed ?	57.639615341716805
Poor Wickham ;	416.3558167446998
for she had a lively , playful disposition , which delighted in any thing ridiculous .	36.33441943253462
What do you think ?	163.9344546955683
Her many attractions were again dwelt on , and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy , and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter .	15.730622057132951
She had instinctively turned away ;	58.36851301349872
Kitty , run down and order the carriage .	69.53996281027587
When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose , the tables were broke up , the carriage was offered to Collins , gratefully accepted , and immediately ordered .	21.012094380831556
I cannot blame myself for having done thus much .	53.206823837602656
Their situation was awkward enough ;	121.9348384836491
When you have killed all your own birds , Bingley , said her mother , I beg you will come here , and shoot as many as you please , on Bennet's manor .	23.273688549905266
and her expectations of advantage to her family , when in a happy humour , were so far beyond reason , that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day , to make his proposals .	24.50148655722027
Do not involve yourself , or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent .	27.660037461881284
There is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping , I dare say .	34.367751062853856
your name will never even be mentioned by any of us .	81.43967239311422
but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame .	52.53828011727037
Copyright laws in most countries are in a constant state of change .	38.820116216705436
Can it be possible that he will marry her ?	83.39747205326803
Oh , no .	250.0969370824154
Bennet replied that he had not .	94.54772516318452
But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister , or say half that remained to be said , for the present .	31.78542263721424
My dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts .	37.263811104412994
All that is known after this is , that they were seen to continue the London road .	40.23541517305827
Good gracious !	216.59187369776393
You must learn some of my philosophy .	58.02983723214849
But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife , as I certainly did .	19.32141021639052
Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family ;	41.39019447832469
How shall we punish him for such a speech ?	56.638844496968815
and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house , walked quietly into it herself .	28.88917607621304
But wishes were vain ;	99.58049514561255
Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety ;	90.1939603371436
It ought to be good , he replied , it has been the work of many generations .	35.173181018810475
Lydia left a few lines for his wife , informing her of their intention .	49.14388485089791
His understanding and temper , though unlike her own , would have answered all her wishes .	40.47905131633877
But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about .	37.94389253017789
Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman , who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable .	24.821256648803697
He never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much ;	34.93437700646612
blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing .	28.032700435294693
She looked at her father to entreat his interference , lest Mary should be singing all night .	26.797876532124217
From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents .	49.05802791708519
1 .	384.9991185797929
But however insincere you may choose to be , you shall not find me so .	37.68317525244897
I knew how it would be .	65.07497307129658
Why , my dear , you must know , Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England ;	21.27085880938015
Perfectly so I thank you .	106.33417628802981
and the girls had the pleasure of hearing , as they entered the drawing-room , that Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation , and was then in the house .	25.037733036153877
repeated Darcy contemptuously ;	214.98594731193583
and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling , was more openly acknowledged , for she did not scruple to call out , What is that you are saying , Fitzwilliam ?	24.304822252859054
Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined .	51.20416947049544
but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ;	38.08841917629192
Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Collins and myself on this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of another : of which we have been advertised by the same authority .	24.138372109737915
and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love , and the object of that love , her friend Eliza , she sat herself seriously to work to find it out .	25.559366843555498
Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life ;	41.51927125139253
This is not quite enough to make her understand his character .	47.80601552540459
in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise , and where he was reduced to meet , frequently meet , reason with , persuade , and finally bribe , the man whom he always most wished to avoid , and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce .	18.193626013835708
You may ask questions , which I shall not choose to answer .	36.83324841042113
It is very unlucky ;	104.22560321359842
From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Darcy had been over-rated , Elizabeth had never yet answered Gardiner's long letter , but now , having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome , she was almost ashamed to find , that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as follows : I would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as I ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory , detail of particulars ;	18.79434340218118
Your's , c .	131.1823014200323
I see your design , Bingley , said his friend .	49.98346751434618
He will be forgot , and we shall all be as we were before .	41.880993730533675
E1 through 1 .	147.104373704791
My dear , dear aunt , she rapturously cried , what delight !	38.62474669814085
And gravely glancing at Darcy , There is a fine old saying , which every body here is of course familiar with 'Keep your breath to cool your porridge , ' and I shall keep mine to swell my song .	15.406358624271036
The Lucases are very artful people indeed , sister .	38.34290837787179
Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement , but was too much oppressed to make any reply .	29.126746119241666
You need not .	126.64756448845486
You have a sweet room here , Bingley , and a charming prospect over that gravel walk .	29.461462440970237
My fingers , said Elizabeth , do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women's do .	21.31840505828855
But it was her business to be satisfied and certainly her temper to be happy ;	43.49037007971057
Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there ( an invitation moreover including the whole party ) so immediately after your arrival !	26.97080874169862
At last she recollected that she had been travelling , and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance .	22.53082913777018
Her aunt asked her , smilingly , how she liked it .	49.27127043826467
it was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small fortune , and however uncertain of giving happiness , must be their pleasantest preservative from want .	20.015173728422063
and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her , she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both , and could very sincerely wish him happy .	18.643375393115573
At present I have not room to do them justice .	62.74398176055232
She studied every sentence : and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different .	28.42156824035382
I will think no more about him .	67.9955632668006
II .	662.9770795749859
The evening passed quietly , unmarked by any thing extraordinary .	40.14355381127821
She found that she was to receive no other answer and , after a short pause , added , I think I have understood that Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again ?	24.572158383506814
She tried to recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence , that might rescue him from the attacks of Darcy ;	17.769054676098246
I comfort myself with thinking , replied Jane , that he certainly would not marry Lydia , if he had not a real regard for her .	24.55620470625086
When the gentlemen had joined them , and tea was over , the card tables were placed .	27.474391720350948
The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541 .	19.624276683948885
They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world .	41.07145180557737
They agreed that Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct ;	23.20260594637217
Is that his design in settling here ?	97.80285189597204
My dear Jane !	155.25037166536566
I assure you , I feel it exceedingly , said Lady Catherine ;	30.13063417499802
I am quite well .	80.08180211413776
VOL .	531.6294007955007
I must think your language too strong in speaking of both , replied Jane , and I hope you will be convinced of it , by seeing them happy together .	23.48426912265131
and to see dear Wickham too !	94.61218657435504
It is well .	122.30594477700181
Miss Bingley made no answer ;	82.82795274335997
Lizzy is not a bit better than the others ;	81.49478828726663
will she be as tall as I am ?	106.15211845423555
His marriage was now fast approaching , and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable , and even repeatedly to say in an ill-natured tone that she wished they might be happy .	25.01019217139593
Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation .	38.62719479754717
Every time they met , it was more decided and remarkable .	59.51600261128377
and he scarcely opened his lips .	70.33218869189902
Her sister , however , assured her , of her being perfectly well ;	40.44159974163122
It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on such occasions it is the etiquette ;	28.41487673738233
My temper I dare not vouch for .	68.30559498166265
Anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn .	45.60315426817657
You have a very small park here , returned Lady Catherine after a short silence .	28.03820238452512
They lagged behind , while Elizabeth , Kitty , and Darcy , were to entertain each other .	29.346159146206162
it was really attentive ;	162.67721462367493
That you certainly shall .	196.50153872213033
and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance , were I distractedly in love with him , I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance .	23.40025567802557
her daughters , alarmed , anxious , uneasy .	78.17669727531465
but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer , larger picture of him than this .	29.58910801999495
While Mary is adjusting her ideas , he continued , let us return to Bingley .	41.98239767049028
If he did shrug his shoulders , it was not till Sir William was out of sight .	24.815376736293267
I do not get on at all .	49.47383562379673
What should not you mind ?	143.29026765389176
And since this sad affair has taken place , it is said , that he left Meryton greatly in debt ;	27.898758173059424
Let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many mortifications , for the sake of discovering them .	18.711239022361603
it is a handsome face .	129.1360704693433
Vain indeed must be all her attentions , vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself , if he were already self-destined to another .	27.40392261509553
I don't know .	108.76148957061505
One must speak a little , you know .	110.35751949472318
Who that knows what his misfortunes have been , can help feeling an interest in him ?	48.321108313047795
and , while pretending to admire her work , said in a whisper , Go to your father , he wants you in the library .	27.596017485354846
Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character , and as she stood before the canvas , on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before ;	22.373575301974416
F1 .	662.9770795749859
I am perfectly satisfied .	77.91321410386081
Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure .	34.83494026089144
For we must attribute this happy conclusion , she added , in a great measure , to his kindness .	36.345935879206486
With astonishment did Elizabeth see , that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself .	45.02510732401985
Section 2 .	291.22471034392987
Jane was beyond competition her favourite child .	83.17135394124917
When first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him ;	38.41922256034659
Mary wished to say something very sensible , but knew not how .	61.34498217080088
Perhaps , said Darcy , I should have judged better , had I sought an introduction , but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers .	25.31093302400813
If an individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are located in the United States , we do not claim a right to prevent you from copying , distributing , performing , displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg are removed .	13.244575590965955
F4 .	662.9770795749859
Elizabeth coloured , and said A little .	68.69184060475197
She then yawned again , threw aside her book , and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement ;	20.30151649463095
Two days after Bennet's return , as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them , and , concluding that she came to call them to their mother , went forward to meet her ;	23.697398117729282
Email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and official page at <URL> For additional contact information : Gregory B Newby Chief Executive and Director gbnewby<MENTION> .	8.981380519824421
Elizabeth said no more but her mind could not acquiesce .	52.119682149496086
Collins , seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her , but Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine's being rather displeased by her staying at home .	19.444823697576954
on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree , for in Darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against another .	23.650975280111986
It is Wickham's intention to go into the regulars ;	40.4102864993228
She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at , and it was rather too early to begin .	26.784036269988256
Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house ;	59.28481643180384
and whether she wished or feared it most , she could scarcely determine .	40.09568591571717
and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss De Bourgh , which I am certain he has very much at heart .	22.075206873066083
its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines , crowded with the young and the gay , and dazzling with scarlet ;	15.855697928130668
who attended to you ?	237.28275813327784
Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way .	46.50726770195922
His character was decided .	128.34248047435545
was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs .	56.9781151221366
Come , Darcy , said he , I must have you dance .	54.70883226884119
but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , Gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible .	18.668042061148803
No , Lizzy , that is what I do not choose .	41.808274246081055
He is as fine a fellow , said Bennet , as soon as they were out of the house , as ever I saw .	24.31626006017527
and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford between our pools at quadrille , while Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh's foot-stool , that she said , 'Collins , you must marry .	17.850915874516655
They could describe an entertainment with accuracy , relate an anecdote with humour , and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit .	21.639894857434573
It would vex me , indeed , to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard .	26.53079580735583
Your cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings .	59.726586809574954
However , I recollected afterwards , that if he had been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for Darcy might have done as well .	27.672808999162793
Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets ;	57.562897824874376
Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts , sarcastic humour , reserve , and caprice , that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character .	16.322748939757716
You are mistaken .	137.96291254890224
and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that Jane must soon cease to regard it , in the enjoyment of his .	21.51879042945865
Two inferences , however , were plainly deduced from the whole ;	41.17166320132374
Oh !	298.0706733468098
He is a gentleman ;	124.61271576780115
Believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention ;	31.730806203444278
and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh , I think it will be very tolerable .	21.56293163021027
Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin's praise ;	40.06554106919206
and returned no more , till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining-parlour .	34.6439870571162
and when she rose to take leave , Elizabeth , ashamed of her mother's ungracious and reluctant good wishes , and sincerely affected herself , accompanied her out of the room .	17.56137465216469
She saw him start at this , but he said nothing , and she continued , You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it .	24.740085538940765
very true , it will be wise in me to refrain from that .	46.18414154552725
No , replied Jane , I have not forgotten him ;	50.86849424057214
Every disposition of the ground was good ;	103.7333538606722
You never see a fault in any body .	64.80557154137232
Consider Collins's respectability , and Charlotte's prudent , steady character .	36.23950447334394
I now give it to you , if you are resolved on having him .	39.58985667197041
Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy .	64.37892346537966
and as she named their relationship to herself , she stole a sly look at him , to see how he bore it ;	21.63725116653427
Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane ;	41.84422866314857
You write uncommonly fast .	96.78237365006564
Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation , but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view .	32.998776871707626
In his present behaviour to herself , moreover , she had a fresh source of displeasure , for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance , could only serve , after what had since passed , to provoke her .	19.579234342490444
Well , that was very decided indeed that does seem as if but however , it may all come to nothing you know .	33.8151745148498
Mamma would like to go too of all things !	87.75655660060117
By tea-time however the dose had been enough , and Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again , and when tea was over , glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies .	19.733260391942913
Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family , she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort .	23.503894726787927
but she was proud of him .	67.4228440033494
What are men to rocks and mountains ?	57.74877579763382
Well , much good may it do them !	78.17301284041035
If he had not had a family of his own , I and my children must have had all his money you know , and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him , except a few presents .	28.24830736494256
They met several times , for there was much to be discussed .	44.6531456066881
The quiet , the retirement of such a life , would have answered all my ideas of happiness !	30.15499544064813
I only want to think you perfect , and you set yourself against it .	38.42800777528351
Of Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well ;	63.683389567407865
Chuse properly , chuse a gentlewoman for my sake ;	49.82056293501885
Among those who are at all his equals in consequence , he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous .	29.947555277282923
Those that best pleased her , as placing his conduct in the noblest light , seemed most improbable .	30.867868921918717
His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped , and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment , maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance , and except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth , requiring no partner in his pleasure .	18.099486890128198
Collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said , thanking her for every fish he won , and apologising if he thought he won too many .	22.189940041405183
I have been a disappointed man , and my spirits will not bear solitude .	29.093058292022832
They solaced their wretchedness , however , by duets after supper , while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister .	20.534721403969815
for his chief wish at present , was to have as little trouble in the business as possible .	47.04731619620769
Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions , but answered them very composedly .	35.32795544489855
and their mother's fortune , though ample for her situation in life , could but ill supply the deficiency of his .	27.24757857526653
You must write again very soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last .	33.24965890073465
They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas ;	55.66623954754327
So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper , or her affectionate heart .	31.104706679949686
and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament ;	33.35872328355991
Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation , that he never again distressed himself , or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth , by introducing the subject of it ;	29.908954907224526
At such an assembly as this , it would be insupportable .	48.00774594783128
From what can it proceed ?	123.73813543321673
Her father was walking about the room , looking grave and anxious .	46.19361018592886
The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion .	44.48190416481766
my dear father , she cried , come back , and write immediately .	39.72047887782262
As to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say she could not positively answer but she did not know of any prepossession ;	27.573640128819264
I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed !	43.039108673887284
He has more to give .	118.3119683037114
An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched ;	73.30343276103531
Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to , it was not on her side a scheme of infamy .	46.053067057039534
Their taking her home , and affording her their personal protection and countenance , is such a sacrifice to her advantage , as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge .	21.396770755631962
and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes , but his eagerness to grasp at any thing .	19.387352276354488
I believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as I wished it in reason .	35.08474889621726
My sisters may write to me .	87.59220699847361
No , no , nonsense , Lizzy .	85.17053601220117
John told us Darcy was here when you sent for us ;	60.939275313918984
Not , however , from any fear of disadvantage from it , individually to herself ;	38.90910775572135
Many smiled ;	369.46201495802796
It is impossible .	132.23573402742448
She was convinced that she could have been happy with him ;	35.594680148677305
All !	931.8122931523299
While I can have my mornings to myself , said she , it is enough .	47.69930224568885
One day's delay she observed , would be of small importance ;	51.03886264991241
I flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so .	32.49278237393601
He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday , to say that he had arrived in safety , and to give me his directions , which I particularly begged him to do .	22.75562986078483
There could not exist in the world two men , over whom Darcy could have such boundless influence .	29.23993750257228
I never was .	157.10459239247217
Her uncle and aunt were all amazement ;	90.25744150587641
The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story , gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach ;	22.430284353941214
In 2001 , the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations .	14.715854077542959
and , as far as their acquaintance reached , there was no fault to find .	44.513955381091556
and , in the imprudence of anger , took the first opportunity of saying , with sneering civility , Pray , Miss Eliza , are not the shire militia removed from Meryton ?	19.847295297930152
It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong ;	38.904361202906806
I knew it to be a most respectable , agreeable corps , and my friend Denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters , and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them .	20.79714151750337
They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother .	46.16399919232309
They were able to love each other , even as well as they intended .	33.123765617299995
Wickham will never marry a woman without some money .	87.41625511886033
That is the most unforgiving speech , said Elizabeth , that I ever heard you utter .	31.933073413009854
How despicably have I acted !	107.4558299581699
I am sure , said she , I cried for two days together when Colonel Millar's regiment went away .	21.673760640861182
Then addressing her daughter , Oh !	77.9072166825482
she added , by far too much .	78.62626401748386
I know my own strength , and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming .	37.758218314282495
I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter , that I had known it , and purposely kept it from him .	24.648039951191016
He owns it himself without disguise .	67.4272575242327
and though , in looking forward , neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity , could be justly expected for her sister ;	24.44856386829231
Wickham's attention was caught ;	211.31831496750615
Excuse me for I must speak plainly .	113.75046391040495
cried Gardiner .	446.76554162066344
Your mother insists upon your accepting it .	55.74522732223301
so easy , that every servant will cheat you ;	72.49414281115203
Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself ?	86.37194333820246
You used us abominably ill , answered Hurst , in running away without telling us that you were coming out .	30.181335360313042
and all three being actuated by one spirit , every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled .	26.20043614870925
and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane ;	35.856864729875454
Oh !	298.0706733468098
He had always intended to visit him , though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go ;	34.7347736272691
Perhaps I am not doing her justice .	75.05400830049167
Oh !	298.0706733468098
How long has she been such a favourite ?	85.5483561119722
You had much better dance .	110.01817019165513
for she was in no cheerful humour .	96.46402098920527
I certainly have had my share of beauty , but I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now .	24.2367779760131
Elizabeth asked questions in vain ;	95.11610981595605
I am sure I do not know .	38.700869212552924
How wonderfully these sort of things occur !	54.91958752647571
Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure .	45.35446605864712
I am very glad to hear such a good account of her , said Lady Catherine ;	26.795370036802755
but I will make her know it .	77.20951860720805
I am sorry , exceedingly sorry , replied Darcy , in a tone of surprise and emotion , that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness .	23.74810275992348
But when they had withdrawn , he said to her , Bennet , before you take any , or all of these houses , for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding .	29.884979424024976
LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a defect in this electronic work within <TIME_PERIOD > of receiving it , you can receive a refund of the money ( if any ) you paid for it by sending a written explanation to the person you received the work from .	17.06112606489976
If she is half as sharp as her mother , she is saving enough .	40.0961672845886
and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate , she began to regret that he came .	30.681696128361267
If he no longer cares for me , why silent ?	47.50269609429824
and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town , as Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them , on their first coming to London , before they procured lodgings .	20.868251895959073
But I suppose you had no opportunity .	82.36251994104772
But Bennet , who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday , which would exactly finish Jane's week , could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before .	22.414643134312747
and , for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings , care not how much I may be wounding your's .	25.088663862667882
and lastly , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked .	19.557191720367573
that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders , and that the business had been compromised accordingly .	29.443571149746685
Bingley had not been of age two years , when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House .	32.20128894906993
Their journey was performed without much conversation , or any alarm ;	60.58816068316194
Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do .	50.28225131897479
but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us , if I had not perceived , by Jane's letter last Wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it , and therefore what I now tell you , can give you no fresh pain .	22.091712042850165
In the former were many good paintings ;	75.65110213028896
and if you can compass it , do cure the younger girls of running after the officers .	28.5584597734297
Collins will be very glad of your company , I am sure .	50.70368605102874
When he was gone , they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on , and their uncle promised , at parting , to prevail on Bennet to return to Longbourn , as soon as he could , to the great consolation of his sister , who considered it as the only security for her husband's not being killed in a duel .	22.009073221361536
and thirdly which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness .	18.844222706586642
Elizabeth shook her head over this letter .	74.03742525579003
Do your sisters play and sing ?	107.16119353210809
When the ladies removed after dinner , Elizabeth ran up to her sister , and seeing her well guarded from cold , attended her into the drawing-room ;	25.730581807648203
He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man ;	57.20391651337023
I hardly know how Collins was first introduced to her notice , but he certainly has not known her long .	32.182949529835376
and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters , and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense .	18.450792473737717
To Jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merit she had undervalued ;	30.50890332126694
It settled the matter ;	136.57757020773533
Collins might never make the offer , and till he did , it was useless to quarrel about him .	35.93962772401975
no , my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both .	53.795811981256804
It was more than civil ;	70.73189135995183
If it were merely a fine house richly furnished , said she , I should not care about it myself ;	29.73213996003248
She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man ;	32.07212064026978
Bennet deigned not to make any reply ;	92.06394030549747
Had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place ?	43.76804767974902
Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed , and , while her courage was high , she immediately said , Darcy , I am a very selfish creature ;	26.690277728525984
When Bennet wrote again to his brother , therefore , he sent his permission for them to come ;	35.928501650854784
but how could that be ?	117.05776755876994
And a special licence .	74.35050576723087
and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them , he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing , and called out to her , My dear Miss Eliza , why are not you dancing ?	18.744025434168556
Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all , but she could see it and write of it without material pain .	33.16277390982605
She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way .	20.770499083483895
Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from Charlotte , as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling .	33.96148146072742

My father bears it better .	83.96871403792052
Mary was obliged to mix more with the world , but she could still moralize over every morning visit ;	26.7577813567975
I am going to-morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality , who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him .	26.986786472358922
and the good-natured wishes for her well-doing , which had proceeded before , from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton , lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances , because with such an husband , her misery was considered certain .	20.0337855810526
Two offences of a very different nature , and by no means of equal magnitude , you last night laid to my charge .	29.031716278765415
She supposed , if he meant any thing , he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter .	32.9285988478714
Redistribution is subject to the trademark license , especially commercial redistribution .	38.002019972010046
but the emotion was short , and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued .	29.74886045122479
Very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia , whose own misery was extreme , and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family .	24.33443438174182
Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable ;	82.93338333021751
Do you prefer reading to cards ?	70.99170689152191
where is your sash my dear ?	112.07313542473955
but I thought I might as well buy it as not .	57.01982379322325
But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together ;	40.22079619131838
CHAPTER III .	249.51422743723455
Soon after their return , a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet ;	54.46942408870702
and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there , recurring to her mind , the few minutes in which they continued together , were some of the most uncomfortable of her life .	23.723440720950858
Jane listened with astonishment and concern ;	106.04397320498113
We must have Long and the Gouldings soon .	59.29755739009589
Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer ;	39.37492729143697
and while Sir William accompanied him , Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house , extremely well pleased , probably , to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's help .	22.056908747075635
He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance , but that is all .	38.872916959687714
It is the greatest of favours when Miss De Bourgh comes in .	33.191986960510675
They had long wished to see him .	71.11922997777276
At length the chaise arrived , the trunks were fastened on , the parcels placed within , and it was pronounced to be ready .	22.2438312292878
I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way .	37.26780309612477
for thither Collins had followed him after breakfast , and there he would continue , nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection , but really talking to Bennet , with little cessation , of his house and garden at Hunsford .	18.908359735835855
He , who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open pleasantry .	25.12146244104412
Compared with some families , I believe we were ;	75.49189283813514
In this room they were received by Miss Darcy , who was sitting there with Hurst and Miss Bingley , and the lady with whom she lived in London .	26.00794078703154
She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it ;	37.41524460009918
Do not give way to useless alarm , added he , though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain .	26.423857120558953
but Collins , after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will , and should never resent her behaviour as any affront , seated himself at another table with Bennet , and prepared for backgammon .	22.31798583788825
A younger son , you know , must be inured to self-denial and dependence .	32.32447554523508
We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word .	34.49880465334549
Yes , or I will never see her again .	64.42478243044403
You have shewn him off now much more than he did himself .	40.89297849064246
From what we have seen of him , continued Gardiner , I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body , as he has done by poor Wickham .	30.096994391196073
She had known , it seems , of their being in love with each other , many weeks .	34.81488974683932
I have , Very well .	65.7677554227049
Through letters , whatever of good or bad was to be told , would be communicated , and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance .	27.758288609436054
It is fortunate , then , that they fall to my lot instead of to yours .	26.50107174955217
Tell him what a dreadful state I am in , that I am frightened out of my wits ;	33.35760890647381
The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings dreadful .	67.22180558177217
Because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement .	52.50269231070209
She could not bear such suspense ;	62.43502191444939
And quite alone ?	198.37845568470945
Nor did that day wear out her resentment .	74.87867935166769
In ran Bennet to her daughter's room , in her dressing gown , and with her hair half finished , crying out , My dear Jane , make haste and hurry down .	17.972920685473426
what does he say ?	236.10890926670174
sir , I do indeed .	135.48402002743273
Is it true ?	233.14209115380226
They could not be untouched by his politeness , and had they drawn his character from their own feelings , and his servant's report , without any reference to any other account , the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known , would not have recognised it for Darcy .	21.721236039300415
but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right .	40.72076043743364
What made you so shy of me , when you first called , and afterwards dined here ?	38.564042395220596
If it was not allowable for him to gain my affections , because I had no money , what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about , and who was equally poor ?	23.319049577244204
and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me .	49.75080867406701
Till this moment , I never knew myself .	80.40534381774486
She looked forward to their entrance , as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend .	36.37290354273456
He was not seated by her ;	72.63916726595598
a respectable-looking , elderly woman , much less fine , and more civil , than she had any notion of finding her .	28.31926741426161
but Elizabeth , less clear-sighted perhaps in his case than in Charlotte's , did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence .	25.728536521119015
who should do it but her own uncle ?	133.55154503651403
She respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his welfare ;	26.92605005740434
He is a sweet tempered , amiable , charming man .	34.643461966837236
I want to know , said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister's , what you have learnt about Wickham .	32.74065785962432
Such a disappointment !	193.85841225112353
It is often only carelessness of opinion , and sometimes an indirect boast .	24.90320958763985
I have just had a letter from Jane , with such dreadful news .	40.90826350496985
Her heart did whisper , that he had done it for her .	46.13224770575315
Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet's general habits , she was absolutely incredulous here .	34.95671334014052
we will ask you no questions .	154.09627493595235
It was dated from Rosings , at eight o'clock in the morning , and was as follows : Be not alarmed , Madam , on receiving this letter , by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments , or renewal of those offers , which were last night so disgusting to you .	17.141260174342968
Her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating .	52.764643381228495
When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen , they returned down stairs , and taking leave of the housekeeper , were consigned over to the gardener , who met them at the hall door .	22.189401715296412
cried Gardiner , whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive .	37.2991800556557
made no mention of the business that had taken him away , and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it .	34.40363728144812
for he was discovered to be proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased ;	33.41527668263833
Every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world ;	33.050689384330184
A few days after this visit , Bingley called again , and alone .	42.640371685150086
Elizabeth was determined ;	195.16384665027837
and then was enraged against herself for being so silly !	48.89374736039893
I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly .	54.35170298505991
Wickham , Lydia , were all forgotten .	100.44488590965936
Oh !	298.0706733468098
But it is fortunate , thought she , that I have something to wish for .	36.301088470707995
He has been here this half hour , and master has had a letter .	34.48065393040489
our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered ;	104.61154687593032
But I cannot I have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly .	30.673339335807402
Charlotte had hardly time to answer , before they were joined by Kitty , who came to tell the same news , and no sooner had they entered the breakfast-room , where Bennet was alone , than she likewise began on the subject , calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion , and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family .	19.780089289588975
I have not forgot , you see ;	68.99157534121622
and during part of that time , Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Bingley , who came from the dance for a few minutes , to press his friend to join it .	23.6944072867079
cried Elizabeth , when she had finished .	70.41980673915724
But every line proved more clearly that the affair , which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent , as to render Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous , was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole .	18.95541321519856
and had any thing of the kind been perceptible , you must be aware that ours is not a family , on which it could be thrown away .	25.081394668764776
Bennet , to whose apartment they all repaired , after a few minutes conversation together , received them exactly as might be expected ;	26.7754835094348
and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air , with such a companion .	28.355846770316045
Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening .	24.867536813665925
for , if I recollect right , he went but the day before .	53.57663828941044
The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire , you must know , was at a ball and at this ball , what do you think he did ?	38.07857598987969
the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me .	44.70846229156838
I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not .	25.370402541070565
Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now .	51.01966378166324
It has often led him to be liberal and generous , to give his money freely , to display hospitality , to assist his tenants , and relieve the poor .	19.947278650404545
The discussion of Collins's offer was now nearly at an end , and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother .	19.005861020635592
and her invitation was accepted with alacrity .	52.20407607251644
On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn ;	48.501106110727015
Sir William Lucas , and his daughter Maria , a good humoured girl , but as empty-headed as himself , had nothing to say that could be worth hearing , and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise .	21.367917324776023
CHAPTER I Miss Bingley's letter arrived , and put an end to doubt .	39.653457327211775
Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph 1 .	20.292065337133536
and by a manoeuvre of Bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone , which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family .	22.626594955850457
I know your disposition , Lizzy .	75.05841023679403
When the clock struck three , Elizabeth felt that she must go ;	46.252614621579696
And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth !	47.477314360268
And I certainly never shall give it .	92.01510916374025
but we will hope at some future period , to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known , and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence .	20.691652560243593
But I have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected .	33.97620857773756
Young ladies of her age , are sometimes a little difficult to manage , and if she has the true Darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way .	29.306894635394613
to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before Collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery .	24.340629766276894
How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Darcy , for now they do appear wholly undeserved .	30.107052362625627
I understand that Collins has made you an offer of marriage .	51.39299518976493
Such was Miss Lucas's scheme ;	141.4650455317859
and she coloured at the idea ;	65.19737023956623
This room was my late master's favourite room , and these miniatures are just as they used to be then .	25.358618526682605
You promised me to insist upon her marrying him .	41.27417590287045
and I am sure if I had been you , I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it .	24.418179284579058
At length , however , the question was asked by her uncle ;	49.07947970694365
Darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours .	49.45301890003707
She wished to discredit it entirely , repeatedly exclaiming , This must be false !	29.263980991105484
for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though George Wickham has treated Darcy in a most infamous manner .	27.00080426324243
This letter gave Elizabeth some pain ;	100.90738256250685
In marrying your nephew , I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere .	34.654960810841665
I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading !	44.02528285422865
I hope your plans in favour of the shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood .	24.212608481310294
I cannot misunderstand you , but I intreat you , dear Lizzy , not to pain me by thinking that person to blame , and saying your opinion of him is sunk .	23.199556127810073
Miss Bennet , I insist on being satisfied .	59.604857535527586
Oh !	298.0706733468098
Yes , she did .	126.32594308280274
How odious I should think them !	99.87306726865607
and if he had the fortune he ought to have , I should think you could not do better .	31.108458247465556
Unless where they like women of fortune , which I think they very often do .	45.157022200228674
CHAPTER IV .	223.11563766813362
She soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt , who did call on him in her return through London , and there relate her journey to Longbourn , its motive , and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth ;	18.54693279912515
but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her .	45.061562924165756
My sole dependence was on you ;	97.16512122758009
My fingers wait your orders .	81.2301101529328
As for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin Elizabeth .	22.28720782619313
Certainly .	889.7560904378281
who can it be ?	318.3586375038572
and much as she had always been disposed to like him , she could not think without anger , hardly without contempt , on that easiness of temper , that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends , and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations .	16.37614516441071
Since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and expedite a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with Wickham , he easily learnt , had never been his design .	32.331049098037724
and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of or I may say , three very silly sisters .	28.70909258821999
you are a great deal too apt you know , to like people in general .	47.807591951077825
Before any answer could arrive from Collins , or any congratulations to Elizabeth , from his wife , the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas lodge .	28.02949195171507
His words seemed to imply it .	61.533317126172975
Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment , after such an affront to Colonel Forster ?	30.150190576351967
and Collins was to attend them , at the request of Bennet , who was most anxious to get rid of him , and have his library to himself ;	26.741655976242445
While thus engaged , Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ;	20.99852481800023
Perhaps there was some truth in this ;	113.67559733086375
was it so ?	500.85698054234575
I am glad of one thing , that he comes alone ;	43.14216094366777
He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before ;	41.22673431877739
She got up , and ran out of the room ;	36.51900406629438
There are a lot of things you can do with Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works .	15.854733803248996
Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution ;	41.05933259391812
when he spoke , his accent had none of its usual sedateness ;	50.78530927069434
The darling wish of his sisters was then gratified ;	49.22035127147952
You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper .	35.052693125325526
She had been watching him the last hour , she said , as he walked up and down the street , and had Wickham appeared Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation , but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers , who in comparison with the stranger , were become stupid , disagreeable fellows .	18.751820857750918
Money !	662.9770795749859
This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening , in summer ;	39.10292910447549
At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal , if he had not been well assured of his cousin's corroboration .	17.495039789934545
Ah !	531.6294007955007
The paling of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side .	35.745400721736466
But I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed .	29.58705201976993
1 .	384.9991185797929
she was aware that no one liked him but Jane ;	63.837838522985535
Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight ;	52.508869812473655
and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last .	29.816530602746163
I defy even Sir William Lucas himself , to produce a more valuable son-in-law .	23.567947267977544
and not a day went by without a solitary walk , in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections .	27.617428881635774
and Elizabeth began to like them herself , when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for Jane .	31.24456225894152
The gentlemen came ;	159.78385421303193
I have seen them both .	78.53296714645897
I beg your pardon .	85.38549052895718
But there were other causes of repugnance ;	50.8973009370627
This , madam , is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together ;	32.82680130820453
and yet how many things have happened !	73.21906187551694
I only fear that the sort of cautiousness , to which you , I imagine , have been alluding , is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe .	19.522122264838735
The one missent must be first attended to ;	41.67353776317629
and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia's connections , which is not likely , can I suppose her so lost to every thing ?	29.24240728984042
and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind .	22.001295590427542
and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal .	25.996882084021856
To the little town of Lambton , the scene of Gardiner's former residence , and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained , they bent their steps , after having seen all the principal wonders of the country ;	23.346577291249627
yet she received them with tolerable ease , and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment , or any unnecessary complaisance .	26.169992781718136
Come here , child , cried her father as she appeared .	55.31916157504573
Bingley , she had likewise seen for an instant , and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed .	32.202691973994355
They were , therefore , to go .	74.91910916579631
That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask .	53.2211618510439
I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere .	47.74283310461067
What are you telling Miss Bennet ?	89.58728423391757
It seems an hopeless business .	81.61182562482425
I hate such false friends .	69.59353388081404
He is come Bingley is come .	101.35597200448257
and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual , and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation .	18.519896675421094
I am not qualified to form one .	44.54921072306925
Yes , Ma'am , all .	91.9542361337691
She liked him too little to care for his approbation .	47.063228979204375
Oh !	298.0706733468098
CHAPTER VI .	223.11563766813362
I think not .	152.35988958273333
and then added , May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left and Collins well .	26.577291397226716
My dear Jane , I am in such a flutter , that I am sure I can't write ;	21.816660931798456
Where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant , distance becomes no evil .	28.10966490453311
She asked her at different times , how many sisters she had , whether they were older or younger than herself , whether any of them were likely to be married , whether they were handsome , where they had been educated , what carriage her father kept , and what had been her mother's maiden name ?	20.64428218047843
We can all plague and punish one another .	54.76209795262212
At length Darcy spoke , and in a constrained manner said , Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them , is less certain .	20.87471628158413
E1 .	678.768366515382
Towards him I have been kinder than towards myself .	52.53865118076564
Indeed , Darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire and , give me leave to say , very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate , and such things may come out , as will shock your relations to hear .	22.686736773181874
Could she exert herself it would be better , but this is not to be expected ;	41.04484539932173
A glass of wine ;	107.02000372508459
She performed her part indeed without much graciousness , but Bennet was satisfied , and soon afterwards ordered her carriage .	26.042485269083567
That is as it happens .	104.10208716988944
Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself , that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking , which ceased when he saw her no more ;	20.889332120504022
Maria would tell her nothing more , and down they ran into the dining-room , which fronted the lane , in quest of this wonder ;	26.72025120906991
Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly .	64.57719762125076
But , my dear sister , can I be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere ?	30.411492618162285
All young ladies accomplished !	159.40033504462573
Yes , vanity is a weakness indeed .	55.81847520479624
Elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again , she wanted Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her .	28.961104895015044
but whether always charming , it is not for me to determine .	46.40446374721876
In short , I will do my best .	79.54220598409054
Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday ;	157.46034103722315
Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them ;	59.81039177170431
But this idea was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw Darcy walk into the room .	24.60322289026692
And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley .	41.774175732709665
till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of Bingley , and her being the sister of Jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding , made every body eager for another , to supply the idea .	31.718105270514155
Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service .	6.257871078712323
Are they indeed ?	291.85608991412835
And then , with a slight bow , turned again into the plantation , and was soon out of sight .	26.529672771733104
CHAPTER VIII .	234.75576465601785
She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do ;	21.891499614109755
I will take care of myself , and of Wickham too .	47.313127928823995
He addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet , with a polite congratulation ;	30.170823073133935
Between the two eldest and herself especially , there subsisted a very particular regard .	49.52868135066906
She was afraid of talking longer of his friend ;	53.894409133689116
I did not think you would ;	72.93502573604052
and as a punishment for him , as well as a possible advantage to Jane , she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Darcy's sister , as , by Wickham's account , she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away .	20.326597116125637
Take whatever you like , and get away .	69.63993577731635
Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year , which , unfortunately for his daughters , was entailed in default of heirs male , on a distant relation ;	21.414475630034342
That he is as false and deceitful , as he is insinuating .	42.913237917698034
The whist party soon afterwards breaking up , the players gathered round the other table , and Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Philips .	20.625765226863592
Oxford , Blenheim , Warwick , Kenelworth , Birmingham , c .	23.56966718469928
The envelope itself was likewise full .	61.311883957740434
Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it ;	41.82280734600861
CHAPTER XV .	223.11563766813362
and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well .	39.09318237197887
cried Lydia .	387.0121116606393
The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit , and the result of it was , that the youngest should tax Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield .	21.196766018232736
You make me laugh , Charlotte ;	102.32398034886064
Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk ;	82.18088140657507
Did Charlotte dine with you ?	134.49390241370514
for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort springs from a breach of promise , for I ought not to have mentioned the subject ?	29.85762485827927
And till Colonel Forster came himself , not one of you entertained a doubt , I suppose , of their being really married ?	32.284140530014625
They had several children .	116.057865207933
But of every other neglect I can believe him capable .	65.7187922242102
and to complete the view , she saw herself seated beneath a tent , tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once .	20.20387046262819
I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance .	35.634736779309556
and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my cards .	22.120138928299415
While in their cradles , we planned the union : and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished , in their marriage , to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly unallied to the family !	21.250546811720536
It is not quite a week since they left Brighton .	48.024017627955146
I should not mind any thing at all .	48.41592526185958
You were Bingley's first choice .	94.3020074158689
I cannot see why Forster should not ask me as well as Lydia , said she , though I am not her particular friend .	25.43054490237021
Bingley was punctual to his appointment ;	67.51533763634926
my dear , dear Jane , I am so happy !	56.558499674248665
and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once .	28.784488896958838
So , do not put yourself to inconvenience .	66.3245444689761
And so , I suppose , they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead .	37.81653047894324
How I long to see her again !	98.9296660680726
To Pemberley , therefore , they were to go .	57.191185868219286
You have widely mistaken my character , if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these .	27.610394308488797
Here are officers enough at Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country .	37.62907104211798
But on the following morning , every hope of this kind was done away .	44.17048045131422
He was silent .	122.47496163570538
cried Wickham with a look which did not escape her .	63.14372912266806
I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's connections .	50.21183385270943
Well , if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own , so much the better .	32.73009552214277
Lady Catherine seemed resigned .	87.31571964783073
Your great men often are ;	141.29593543035116
He declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister's attachment ;	35.06626411702032
My dearest Lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Darcy , to be treating his father's favourite in such a manner , one , whom his father had promised to provide for .	23.038007991635748
Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks , online payments and credit card donations .	22.442935387386665
a report which highly incensed Bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood .	28.78867903988945
Do let me ask my partner to introduce you .	60.152554953586275
and while she steadily repressed it , could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing , that however long , and for whatever cause , his attentions had been withdrawn , her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal .	19.785765809436498
my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken .	74.89089469234945
The next was in these words .	93.57474704909383
Her ladyship was highly incensed .	100.08331819799051
To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate !	58.44639935002975
In this perturbed state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on ;	36.84430370934157
but , though she always kept a very good table , she did not think any thing less than two courses , could be good enough for a man , on whom she had such anxious designs , or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a-year .	20.351259872166573
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him ;	34.581175303099904
he has some friends , though perhaps not so many as he deserves .	60.10865636001454
They will ruin your happiness .	92.26848633810401
and at the age of twenty-seven , without having ever been handsome , she felt all the good luck of it .	28.44509846774052
From what I can collect , he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them .	24.747919411219236
Could she have seen half as much love in Darcy for herself , she would have ordered her wedding clothes .	38.14711717334252
The horses were post ;	83.71675748967724
Well , and what news does it bring ?	63.43466643401173
Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning , and writing to Jane , while Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village , when she was startled by a ring at the door , the certain signal of a visitor .	21.624882915283195
Thoughtlessness , want of attention to other people's feelings , and want of resolution , will do the business .	34.95614388864252
There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended ;	36.93931136150698
You doubt me , cried Jane , slightly colouring ;	44.170371744226564
The possibility of meeting Darcy , while viewing the place , instantly occurred .	35.65766219302501
No , that I am sure I shall not ;	43.51671749092275
and she made the most of the time , by visiting about with her daughter , and having very frequent parties at home .	29.851978677164748
But she had chosen it with her eyes open ;	56.875656873031
He is nothing to us , you know , and I am sure I never want to see him again .	28.133908840024326
Lydia does not leave me because she is married ;	79.70454361215522
My love , should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much ?	53.15922760499874
Another intreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the desired effect ;	33.774859055518185
We have tried two or three subjects already without success , and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine .	31.299626288905024
Of course , we hope that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work .	14.215263655908348
and the girls smiled on each other .	56.96238699263608
and if she were married to him to-morrow , I should think she had as good a chance of happiness , as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth .	28.01308257648132
Your humility , Bingley , said Elizabeth , must disarm reproof .	40.459342718103244
How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own daughters I cannot understand ;	35.30638705623249
and her features are not at all handsome .	53.25097147196547
You observed it , Darcy , I am sure , said Miss Bingley ;	31.229353405189954
I know you will do him such ample justice , that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent .	25.43026359226466
It cannot last long .	123.64786350867222
no , no , this is not likely .	151.6692178782144
If he had another motive , I am sure it would never disgrace him .	31.078191348902127
Well , well , I only hope it will last .	55.07415352622155
In a fortnight they were to go , and once gone , she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account .	32.429469435634864
I appeal to Darcy : but let me not interrupt you , You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady , whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me .	17.106691396223383
And for this we are to be thankful .	65.60557286576405
Miss Bennet still looked all amazement .	95.61013637393606
She became jealous of his esteem , when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it .	25.05975278188732
but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming , she had no wish of her recovering immediately , as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield .	23.019260113587734
I was given good principles , but left to follow them in pride and conceit .	34.643644163395535
for though I am the youngest , I'm the tallest .	44.028055310874045
You are over scrupulous surely .	56.55843969369595
and she turned away with alarm , while Reynolds replied , that he was , adding , but we expect him to-morrow , with a large party of friends .	24.083787440238865
yes .	728.0810120833138
I thank you , again and again , for not going to the Lakes .	33.629120234477014
I know them a little .	113.26920608509867
and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send .	58.768668391657016
How could you begin ?	147.1609432116393
But I am at his disposal .	55.24693357541255
There was no help for it however .	100.496731676559
Thank God !	319.32433648920636
It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth ;	41.1478817521574
oh !	662.9770795749859
what's his name .	238.61725431518255
and the pleasure of being with Charlotte , and the kind attentions she had received , must make her feel the obliged .	31.054254305485475
Well girls , said she , as soon as they were left to themselves , What say you to the day ?	35.14726538887818
Why should they not go on to Scotland , if that had been the case ?	62.468982956851775
All that I can promise you , therefore , is not to be in a hurry .	42.62510075993097
My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly , to try to discover her .	36.58318085896169
I wish I could say any thing to comfort you , replied Elizabeth ;	41.814393836986476
But you know married women have never much time for writing .	51.9371851365687
it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited ;	40.417338198403215
And you saw the old housekeeper , I suppose ?	68.1875281680625
but Wickham was as far beyond them all in person , countenance , air , and walk , as they were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips , breathing port wine , who followed them into the room .	15.697040453016822
It was consoling , that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush .	25.903340634391025
Of his former way of life , nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself .	49.03074828980156
there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her , and though by no means so clever as herself , she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her's , he might become a very agreeable companion .	21.343672943619705
he replied , and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled .	34.234060690219636
but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless .	38.61571645963279
But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment .	30.761753245782312
But I will not torment you with vain wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks .	27.746121642741542
but such of us as wished to learn , never wanted the means .	52.70909447093264
Yes , Sir ;	166.7216122301351
In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else , and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room .	21.95731112776145
Bingley urged Jones's being sent for immediately ;	60.24583766755256
though it was some time , I confess , before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice .	37.65099509891695
and from such as had been already visible below , she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcy's , in crayons , whose subjects were usually more interesting , and also more intelligible .	20.157148135427075
I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies .	27.732819342961122
The whole party before them , indeed , excited a lively attention .	35.4625308493156
I shall be back by dinner .	55.63828008069341
and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do .	30.066675715749106
You cannot have been always at Longbourn .	74.21596833576062
Well , my dear , said he , when she ceased speaking , I have no more to say .	27.663590337569772
and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view , as he meant to chuse one of the daughters , if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report .	20.408251014318783
you mean Jane , I suppose because he danced with her twice .	56.272790385476846
Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor .	43.9418509764049
Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here ;	46.51688674272784
Ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either , detection could not be in your power , and suspicion certainly not in your inclination .	25.87136169270679
Not handsome enough to dance with !	87.39848102927085
Elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak ;	34.92798788797166
How Darcy looked , therefore , she could not tell .	56.88889233316974
Elizabeth was pleased , though , when she asked herself the reason , she had very little to say in reply .	42.1594027471159
Impossible , Bennet , impossible , when I am not acquainted with him myself ;	40.945846686974505
I told him , moreover , that I believed myself mistaken in supposing , as I had done , that your sister was indifferent to him ;	30.010577093351344
and still thought there might have been time enough .	45.85758247791373
I shall not be able to keep you and so I warn you .	38.696511411870254
My dear , dear Lydia !	91.25253971417386
It was owing to him , to his reserve , and want of proper consideration , that Wickham's character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was .	17.258819384065788
It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened .	37.64958656740827
Such a countenance , such manners !	113.91949190441005
Lydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself .	30.84191471013394
I know very well , madam , said he , that when persons sit down to a card table , they must take their chance of these things , and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object .	19.007633378541545
While there was an officer in Meryton , they would flirt with him ;	52.761357174614176
they were dances of mortification .	103.22389463899013
CHAPTER XIII .	223.11563766813362
and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time .	34.86918548330273
That is very true , said Elizabeth ;	61.93771362445417
But it was not to be .	68.98043519154761
Elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced ;	70.9215283030739
She was going to the butcher's , she told me , on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday , and she has got three couple of ducks , just fit to be killed .	17.991888847593174
she replied , endeavouring to recover herself .	63.86662917309983
The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time , and the plan became perfect as plan could be .	26.619543683939426
It is enough to know they are discovered , I have seen them both Then it is , as I always hoped , cried Jane ;	31.15090409108508
Only this ;	447.0654272434712
You judge very properly , said Bennet , and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy .	25.872465937574983
But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule .	28.146728574206897
I was only confused for the moment , because I felt that I should be looked at .	28.00372853454966
She began at length to recover , to fidget about in her chair , get up , sit down again , wonder , and bless herself .	19.507358209627665
her eldest daughter , she must just mention she felt it incumbent on her to hint , was likely to be very soon engaged .	30.674191107793526
No , I believe not .	116.9097917703021
VOL .	531.6294007955007
for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone .	53.59007360808017
The far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances .	26.945366735820635
but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts , fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one , with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance .	23.287549123510217
Pray write instantly , and let me understand it unless it is , for very cogent reasons , to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary ;	25.335492277796842
The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard , his claims on Darcy , and all that he had suffered from him , was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed ;	23.639433766386073
But when Elizabeth told of his silence , it did not seem very likely , even to Charlotte's wishes , to be the case ;	33.60058034205429
Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well-bred man , and talked very pleasantly ;	25.57708081043653
Into one house in this neighbourhood , they shall never have admittance .	50.003575817189876
But with me , it is not so .	67.89900458228271
Nor was it under many , many minutes , that she could comprehend what she heard ;	47.56752237255084
It drew from her , however , the exertion of speaking , which nothing else had so effectually done before ;	28.272286435016884
Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied , Yes , you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that .	28.028461676742378
Her air was not conciliating , nor was her manner of receiving them , such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank .	30.725671093414043
When those dances were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by Darcy , who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him .	22.449346489946866
She was very equal therefore to address Bingley on the subject of the ball , and abruptly reminded him of his promise ;	23.593860579372485
Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning ;	31.149722738106977
When dinner was over , she returned directly to Jane , and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room .	21.043569180794048
This young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way , with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire , splendid property , noble kindred , and extensive patronage .	19.953385150016004
Kitty is slight and delicate , and Mary studies so much , that her hours of repose should not be broken in on .	26.53708893690809
But I have always observed , that they who are good-natured when children , are good-natured when they grow up ;	25.68544637954008
but she still thought him partial to Jane , and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend's permission , or being bold enough to come without it .	21.063435814401345
You must send John with the young ladies , Collins .	48.63927512312971
Pray read on .	252.933597831037
CHAPTER XI .	234.75576465601785
but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it , and making her sister the excuse , said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book .	19.726088594829697
but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal ;	33.38430782564591
But we must stem the tide of malice , and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other , the balm of sisterly consolation .	13.18813316518511
the happiest , wisest , most reasonable end !	91.12166521861276
At that instant she felt , that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends , for moments of such painful confusion .	32.53705553478562
Not like the wild young men now-a-days , who think of nothing but themselves .	41.26978415169029
I believe she did and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object .	28.733317610310092
and Wickham , who happened to sit near Elizabeth , began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood , with a good humoured ease , which she felt very unable to equal in her replies .	20.88940994210986
and by her connivance and aid , he so far recommended himself to Georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement .	20.53201134707198
How much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book !	48.987073710544976
Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Darcy .	78.7314382424324
it cannot be .	239.6065876116483
His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own ;	52.87506419880039
he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield , and she blushed as she answered , I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family .	24.97164474711396
The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter , and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country .	23.828611028958846
What he means to do , I am sure I know not ;	50.872869756851586
Generous , good man , I am afraid he has distressed himself .	44.95717007728605
His doing so drew her notice .	95.9204167638339
The consequence of it is , that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have , and that Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever .	27.4368042794259
Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word .	58.98228727538446
Gardiner left them soon after breakfast .	114.30134415721523
To Darcy it was welcome intelligence Elizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough .	42.83775372872404
I knew how it would be I knew he would manage every thing .	34.044468560721015
a father absent , a mother incapable of exertion , and requiring constant attendance ;	39.30095453714639
It was then disclosed in the following manner .	44.99468679961747
Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay , as they had been at first .	34.08294947296177
I need not explain myself farther ;	47.04420633306051
his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do .	40.67086618163954
Indeed you must go , for it will be impossible for us to visit him , if you do not .	36.538564201564604
Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends , that could materially lessen its weight .	27.68349987911405
and her uncle and aunt , leaving her to enjoy them in quiet , set off by themselves .	24.921257025430023
Well , he is a very undeserving young man and I do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now .	24.515862792377007
and now , I hope you are satisfied .	50.952813434372175
III .	662.9770795749859
In a doleful voice Bennet thus began the projected conversation .	32.04810811501938
But these , I suppose , are precisely what you are without .	44.72266429238172
She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love , rather than by his ;	22.163570997233887
for a few minutes he was silent ;	78.80380532275768
It is a long time , Bingley , since you went away , said Bennet .	29.091842429164448
no one was to be put in competition with him .	66.24111229694014
One has got all the goodness , and the other all the appearance of it .	36.46816633493316
the eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt , there cannot be two opinions on that point .	41.30544593351056
She answered him in the usual way , and after a moment's pause , added , My eldest sister has been in town these three months .	22.662675748297087
and Lady Lucas , who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken .	14.747762994382864
It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man .	21.87767729605396
Elizabeth , as she affectionately embraced her , whilst tears filled the eyes of both , lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives .	16.899176162833918
Long before it had taken place , my opinion of you was decided .	63.51509542131419
Dear , dear Lizzy .	194.51434502264667
But I can assure you , she added , that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy ;	22.970265260478005
When , after examining the mother , in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Darcy , she turned her eyes on the daughter , she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment , at her being so thin , and so small .	23.660705491573577
The conduct of neither , if strictly examined , will be irreproachable ;	29.722001453707183
My mind was more agreeably engaged .	81.74283998159339
She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances , and she was in no humour to indulge him .	24.913086422868133
He had certainly formed such a plan , and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend .	18.99046334219766
True ;	843.1429980086798
whenever she was alone , she gave way to it as the greatest relief ;	53.88422829770973
The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner , and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank such affability and condescension , as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine .	16.75723139417003
And pray , Lizzy , what said Lady Catherine about this report ?	38.45211484592768
By the Author of Sense and Sensibility .	44.044388545198956
But of all the views which his garden , or which the country , or the kingdom could boast , none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings , afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house .	17.85459025940821
No thanks to his gallantry for that .	99.9729881532915
and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see Darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea .	21.479694623750728
Bennet , with great civility , begged her ladyship to take some refreshment ;	45.154819396912835
An unhappy alternative is before you , Elizabeth .	81.43983994278186
and while Darcy was attending them to their carriage , Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth's person , behaviour , and dress .	21.664417568145286
Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted ?	51.32771441026481
I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband ;	29.07847409011652
Believe her to be deceived by all means .	95.92471370351751
and though more astonished than gratified herself , by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her .	25.176032175997147
for she received an invitation from Forster , the wife of the Colonel of the regiment , to accompany her to Brighton .	31.88049633551549
It is almost past belief .	69.03685473744204
LIMITED WARRANTY , DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the Right of Replacement or Refund described in paragraph 1 .	12.659873249042185
The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements , with such news as the country afforded ;	32.98887735638184
Imagine our surprise .	195.54675852146931
but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded .	40.75726683745103
Good gracious !	216.59187369776393
and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world .	27.265766953000732
A low phaeton , with a nice little pair of ponies , would be the very thing .	31.074329623727806
Your coming to Longbourn , to see me and my family , said Elizabeth , coolly , will be rather a confirmation of it ;	29.659826970850226
I am ashamed of you !	70.34813211402847
He is rich , to be sure , and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane .	28.315554178772988
Miss Darcy , though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations , readily obeyed .	26.275009430868863
he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire , and Jane and Elizabeth , in addition to every other source of happiness , were within thirty miles of each other .	21.0982135398992
That he was surprised by the connexion was evident ;	53.07085656084096
A clear ten thousand per annum .	49.733602372114426
My dear Bennet , you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother .	34.721353371753
This is the only point , I flatter myself , on which we do not agree .	39.93729787810275
Four nieces of Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means ;	40.32246700371676
Till I can forget his father , I can never defy or expose him .	38.67880992757887
But now several minutes elapsed , without bringing the sound of his voice ;	36.19119989800567
had I known what I ought , what I dared , to do !	75.3371660495786
that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance !	41.53417172751085
Her power was sinking ;	124.43009815743325
1 .	384.9991185797929
and perhaps he might be doing the same .	66.74428050850138
Yes , he had no engagement at all for to-morrow ;	48.99522286827704
When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night , she followed her , and made the important communication .	31.29828937878145
Yes , very indifferent indeed , said Elizabeth , laughingly .	36.4103337381192
Miss Elizabeth Bennet !	309.8804034463945
Elizabeth most thankfully consented , and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay , and bring back a supply of clothes .	22.38399089564157
Gardiner declared his willingness , and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation .	38.6402329440453
CHAPTER XIV .	223.11563766813362
I have no such injuries to resent .	49.1591060577224
but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion , suffered no variation of colour .	22.136734045697334
Oh , Lydia !	218.74290304695717
But now it was all too natural .	80.3652875549839
but he seemed to like his second better .	67.1012701356551
My dear sir , replied Collins , I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship's concurrence .	20.963511232453342
make haste , my love .	171.39925460481962
and he thought it an excellent one , full of eligibility and suitableness , and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part .	22.565639786324088
He enquired in a friendly , though general way , after her family , and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done .	25.61227630473351
and why not to me ?	96.18027104019991
If he fears me , why come hither ?	56.242187335298894
That will make thirteen with ourselves , so there will be just room at table for him .	37.13963163787311
Oh !	298.0706733468098
there were half hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte , and the weather was so fine for the time of year , that she had often great enjoyment out of doors .	25.721544615840916
Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form , he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing ;	18.639307078646127
No officer is ever to enter my house again , nor even to pass through the village .	40.42566491335949
Bennet , in short , was in very great spirits ;	69.86387030509496
As a child I was taught what was right , but I was not taught to correct my temper .	30.868716810134906
he drew back his chair , took a newspaper from the table , and , glancing over it , said , in a colder voice , Are you pleased with Kent ?	19.257890881081313
And there are several of the young men , too , that she likes very much .	35.73701249396879
You are then resolved to have him ?	72.10219023103427
Wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates ;	30.836547346154706
You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I hope , though you have but a short lease .	36.16818128758872
They met again on Sunday , and then I saw him too .	56.172871342187165
and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition .	26.241745433455833
You will not be fit to be seen when you get there .	39.579803840879926
The period of expectation was now doubled .	49.25942345942178
Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject .	35.551270036580334
I am going away myself .	67.018456292568
that is rather singular .	205.95277053616883
But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed ;	52.171334287903136
It was an encouragement of vice ;	63.65521263331668
Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so , said Collins very gravely but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you .	29.505403918333364
I leave it to yourself to determine , said Bennet .	56.35195844763451
Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the expression of heart-felt delight , diffused over his face , became him ;	20.36192851965293
No .	738.533535324251
Now , Lizzy , I think I have surprised you .	56.67333254500741
she repeated .	414.02781653242346
Upon my word , said her Ladyship , you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person .	36.85112364275543
I certainly saw Darcy speaking to her .	62.805334987665084
He did not leave his name , and till the next day , it was only known that a gentleman had called on business .	31.646686647401957
If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other , or ever so similar before-hand , it does not advance their felicity in the least .	20.6663319671457
I see what you are feeling , replied Charlotte , you must be surprised , very much surprised , so lately as Collins was wishing to marry you .	29.140858543991648
But are you pleased , Jane ?	110.07653077377697
do any thing rather than marry without affection .	76.67358775122435
CHAPTER XIX .	223.11563766813362
Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his countenance .	59.80796619156241
Certainly , my dear , nobody said there were ;	60.88402791228209
You know my sentiments .	130.9626416850359
that the young man's marrying her , was a patched-up business , at the expence of your father and uncles .	33.12148096981609
In the intervals of her discourse with Collins , she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth , but especially to the latter , of whose connections she knew the least , and who she observed to Collins , was a very genteel , pretty kind of girl .	20.28671933321772
She talked to Elizabeth again and again ;	98.4969313753108
Miss Bennet had slept ill , and though up , was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room .	29.942933299428187
Lady Catherine it appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings , for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Darcy .	22.080043103964353
How are you all ?	226.98414159744726
How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning , Darcy , she cried ;	47.51449485958657
I should say , one of her ladyship's carriages , for she has several .	40.53511141522367
and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time .	37.88045197517621
How grievous then was the thought that , of a situation so desirable in every respect , so replete with advantage , so promising for happiness , Jane had been deprived , by the folly and indecorum of her own family !	25.587343494988517
for though dilatory in undertaking business , he was quick in its execution .	34.27730478224808
and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet .	26.492511383024183
and if a smart young colonel , with five or six thousand a year , should want one of my girls , I shall not say nay to him ;	23.729041912105735
and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance .	40.09019123054261
I send no compliments to your mother .	61.60735121289809
I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow .	22.066029397381868
Your younger sisters must be very young ?	90.92611441966166
It was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for Longbourn , before she told her sister of Darcy's proposals .	26.742525102364358
Collins , awkward and solemn , apologising instead of attending , and often moving wrong without being aware of it , gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give .	17.96544620389672
But , though this might be imaginary , she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy , who had been set up as a rival of Jane .	22.76956897051054
Now , Kitty , you may cough as much as you chuse , said Bennet ;	43.07980033768837
No , indeed .	194.35099053968423
All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over .	72.12438547504125
Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy .	49.34898008192931
and then , unwilling to let the subject drop , added , He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire , I understand .	25.09354528125402
Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father , their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility .	25.307338345534273
and if she would give him leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them .	34.51158423867834
I should be sorry , you know , to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire .	28.510347251574768
And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry ?	61.40815297944334
But it must not , shall not be .	76.50077882307272
and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park , hurried home with the great intelligence .	28.820659590341737
After abusing you so abominably to your face , I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations .	36.62633834863355
Lizzy , said he , I was going to look for you ;	59.36210994956263
cried Elizabeth , darting from her seat as she finished the letter , in eagerness to follow him , without losing a moment of the time so precious ;	23.41465511045768
Her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction ;	21.5038556096192
From the farther disadvantage of Lydia's society she was of course carefully kept , and though Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her , with the promise of balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going .	24.20560573243035
I do not at all know ;	60.970843740183504
Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield and looked in vain for Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her .	23.718233619788343
Good Heaven !	268.16899036376185
After playing some Italian songs , Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air ;	25.741571760564874
and when I next write to her , I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account .	35.467434598871385
Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought , said Bennet ;	47.04753131843537
and with many men , I dare say , it succeeds .	36.68957003829507
Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency .	53.71845264504187
Will you be very angry with me , my dear Lizzy , if I take this opportunity of saying ( what I was never bold enough to say before ) how much I like him .	23.130166905211848
and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend .	25.932070808797622
I am glad I bought my bonnet , if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox !	27.2448517326459
That the wish of giving happiness to you , might add force to the other inducements which led me on , I shall not attempt to deny .	30.22426548892723
and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment ;	50.01335847838778
but she , who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible , gaily continued , Oh !	23.95045028737739
Surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement .	65.90704727530043
and in spite of his being a lover , Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity , to be rationally founded , because they had for basis the excellent understanding , and super-excellent disposition of Jane , and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself .	17.631241890408774
CHAPTER XXIII .	249.51422743723455
On the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband .	41.50767155993057
And who is there , whatever might be their former conduct , that she would believe capable of such an attempt , till it were proved against them ?	32.42781793624307
It was an earnest , steadfast gaze , but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind .	22.44665953422023
I will only add , God bless you .	40.85395490423541
of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance !	112.7691055183327
Wickham , perhaps , is my favourite ;	119.00842479296092
and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage , she may have less trouble in achieving a second ;	24.363532388837015
Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder , and when at last Collins allowed him time to speak , replied with an air of distant civility .	25.036350161015744
But , my dear , your father cannot spare the horses , I am sure .	32.04408754362051
His complexion became pale with anger , and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature .	23.17690457988994
It would be such a delicious scheme , and I dare say would hardly cost any thing at all .	19.389218438544116
She would not give him time to reply , but hurrying instantly to her husband , called out as she entered the library , Oh !	20.88092370249619
mamma , do the people here abouts know I am married to-day ?	49.41048292642161
She is well , and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother .	30.916036041912932
Oh !	298.0706733468098
A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe .	35.31286038567073
Perhaps she is full young to be much in company .	79.12746195070034
I know very well that nothing can be done .	59.649364066797375
She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool ;	50.085526036363454
Bennet , how can you abuse your own children in such a way ?	41.99738356468865
You refuse to obey the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude .	29.57488675862045
It is a circumstance which Darcy of course would not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady's family , it would be an unpleasant thing .	24.368947095209517
but to say the truth , I was too cross to write .	62.15817956023422
that she is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference , and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him , she means ( most kindly ) to put me on my guard ?	27.023794257531968
for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ;	31.09392998622992
You have no regard , then , for the honour and credit of my nephew !	43.81440523247965
There was no arguing upon such a project .	40.290811834822726
But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue , she could easily conjecture .	22.031040357625812
But the person who advanced , was now near enough to see her , and stepping forward with eagerness , pronounced her name .	22.440768450880007
As she went up stairs to get ready , Bennet followed her , saying , I am quite sorry , Lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself .	24.768322225825095
He heard her with astonishment .	113.82862553161699
but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets , she soon grew too much interested in the game , too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes , to have attention for any one in particular .	16.51603103823331
She is my youngest girl but one .	79.76321647168918
Lydia came to us ;	229.77326560275156
Every body was surprised ;	199.9169215592685
Her performance on the piano-forte is exquisite .	52.61641071835626
Elizabeth , construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister , was pleased ;	30.517586013452643
I did hear , too , that there was a time , when sermon-making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present ;	30.238323449990975
I must find Gardiner this moment , on business that cannot be delayed ;	42.972157864589136
And with a low bow he left her to attack Darcy , whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched , and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident .	24.31125116578827
she had no conversation , no style , no taste , no beauty .	59.13082794537953
If your feelings are still what they were last April , tell me so at once .	36.54943229901608
In pompous nothings on his side , and civil assents on that of his cousins , their time passed till they entered Meryton .	23.675997870508347
and in his manner of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment , reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh , and trusting their opinion of her their opinion of every body would always coincide , there was a solicitude , an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard ;	16.79750062639264
Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case , unknown to the society of Hertfordshire ;	24.172814528656744
Bingley and Jane were standing together , a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other .	34.31675022048066
Does that young lady know Darcy ?	108.74250756138633
I shall not sport with your impatience , by reading what he says on that point .	31.300098917421504
But whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ;	22.253430960774363
That such a consequence as this should ensue , you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts .	35.0130576428488
Pray tell your sister that I long to see her .	70.58174972477639
A single man of large fortune ;	81.66669407514095
It was the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton , and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace .	22.010867515567217
and if they are not married already , make them marry .	51.33559937331289
and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend .	24.12002436260057
Her father captivated by youth and beauty , and that appearance of good humour , which youth and beauty generally give , had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind , had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her .	19.09313705155658
and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men .	31.468013045461863
My good , kind brother !	135.7976836332142
Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character , but said nothing .	42.518340900131946
If my children are silly I must hope to be always sensible of it .	43.379955250584715
It was the favourite wish of his mother , as well as of her's .	33.02815366190468
How could I be so silly as to wish it !	83.46464674286042
Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you , as his father did before him ?	50.11660760925153
The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family .	43.22676973217353
In another minute Bingley , but without seeming to have noticed what passed , took leave and rode on with his friend .	30.337622663838047
I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family .	18.346610600794822
I can readily believe , answered he gravely , that report may vary greatly with respect to me ;	26.767504822133624
Perhaps other people have said so before , but not one with such justice .	68.4315675789921
I speak feelingly .	106.99289788398642
Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth , this was not the best method of recommending herself ;	37.348726497373974
I did not know before , continued Bingley immediately , that you were a studier of character .	32.344855593063706
Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ;	125.59341088846375
I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for I am fond of superior society ;	29.56727406572659
I always had a value for him .	67.81589822624238
You will easily comprehend , from these particulars , that Wickham's circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be .	30.774922559275645
and Jane , who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience , from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit , was delighted at her entrance .	21.564548303431735
My dear Friend , If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me , we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives , for a whole day's t te- -t te between two women can never end without a quarrel .	13.66834438320891
Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife .	56.1781443105627
She is a great deal too ill to be moved .	40.31117337527427
On distinguishing the ladies of the group , the two gentlemen came directly towards them , and began the usual civilities .	30.237119142034896
You could scarcely escape discredit and misery .	63.73397410277798
They stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece , who , astonished and confused , scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face , and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family .	18.781589753538114
Elizabeth made no answer .	95.52343724357662
They were forced to conclude , that he had no pleasing intelligence to send , but even of that they would have been glad to be certain .	23.767365840874152
One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight .	47.998549409453005
I do not believe a word of it , my dear .	41.690044169072124
we must forget it ourselves .	149.08702736680212
And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman .	37.18519251308598
Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party .	46.77702196339113
What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory , and as she recalled his very words , it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other ;	23.975214825452948
They now walked on in silence ;	98.28939122949295
Jane resolutely kept her place at the table ;	81.99436854097232
then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms .	54.833247885725356
Are you going much farther ?	104.2704615074161
I have met with two instances lately ;	46.38952579014303
I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy .	32.25288880351553
for I dare not hope , he continued in a lower and more serious tone , that he is improved in essentials .	31.262509366705988
Do you often dance at James's ?	82.10484544473626
In anticipating the happiness of Bingley , which of course was to be inferior only to his own , he continued the conversation till they reached the house .	28.49065599289062
Indeed , Bennet , said she , it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that I should be forced to make way for her , and live to see her take my place in it !	22.726027165332702
And Mary King is safe !	92.43387705366658
Jane ran to her uncle and aunt , and welcomed and thanked them both , with alternate smiles and tears .	26.401226012436126
By all means , cried Bingley ;	142.2280446662155
After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence , health , good humour and cheerfulness began to re-appear at Longbourn .	27.095493912437647
and Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again , whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them .	28.442817806439866
Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off .	47.92399741169808
if he were so , they could not succeed .	88.12173411307954
her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances , and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else Darcy was condemned as the worst of men .	17.09706423914859
In a few days Bingley returned Bennet's visit , and sat about ten minutes with him in his library .	29.812303438369323
and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister , and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them .	19.844066486717242
Besides , there was truth in his looks .	70.6539935024224
but at any rate , was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal .	36.54393940823532
were questions with which she amused herself .	93.99601169666138
I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind .	40.73789555757738
But , however , he is very welcome to come to Netherfield , if he likes it .	31.573824935422838
A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty ;	32.90955822167238
But Gardiner , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in her hopes as her fears ;	22.840979903189503
She then hastened away to her mother , who had purposely broken up the card party , and was sitting up stairs with Kitty .	24.044145152909778
and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Denny , to whom Lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned ;	23.261936890646393
but to her own more extensive information , he was the person , to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as what Jane felt for Bingley .	23.15783724073212
What would I give to hear your strictures on them !	70.16295488580477
Lizzy , said he , what are you doing ?	77.26334681423505
You will find her manners beyond any thing I can describe ;	50.21860652845809
I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had .	52.04784833672511
What an agreeable man Sir William is , Bingley is not he ?	63.89492497305957
I always said it must be so , at last .	60.1275380053902
People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking .	40.10826330123174
Though Lydia had never been a favourite with them , and Gardiner could not but be deeply affected .	37.06491121778481
But so they always are .	113.64134350934775
But to be sure , the good lady who shewed us the house , did give him a most flaming character !	32.658629335509985
He was most highly esteemed by Darcy , a most intimate , confidential friend .	34.202975305695645
Not to appear to disgrace his family , to degenerate from the popular qualities , or lose the influence of the Pemberley House , is a powerful motive .	18.93414398522047
It is too long ago .	75.60908623000788
No , my dear ;	119.17482831751903
Annesley is with her .	173.68611427400947
Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they admired her and liked her , and pronounced her to be a sweet girl , and one whom they should not object to know more of .	23.46851279641282
but since he had been in the militia , it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them .	21.510949132316174
I do not believe Long will do any such thing .	46.61904216892682
Ten thousand a year !	133.37729272737602
but allow me to assure you that I have your respected mother's permission for this address .	29.9588170030522
Darcy sends you all the love in the world , that he can spare from me .	33.54466367295296
Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk , they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance , and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance .	16.60128721633093
Yes ;	506.5076850786652
Is not he a charming man ?	118.72115977744281
Oh , Lizzy !	206.91653399511583
I came to try you .	79.69469141249425
Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes .	46.778523375810124
His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same , said Elizabeth angrily ;	35.90360228141005
which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption , she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister , had been formed before he quitted the inn , and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there , had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend .	18.71929318257583
You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing .	49.00916547908655
We shall be at Newcastle all the winter , and I dare say there will be some balls , and I will take care to get good partners for them all .	22.66108090640568
They have known her much longer than they have known me ;	73.13576391568635
What say you , Mary ?	150.8685024049884
and Charlotte , detained first by the civility of Collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear .	22.30416479640541
She was at least free from the offence of Darcy's farther notice ;	37.994610342561685
and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close ;	22.19253927695268
Read it aloud , said their father , for I hardly know myself what it is about .	39.95500786636575
But really , Ma'am , I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters , that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early .	22.83820323902344
The present always occupies you in such scenes does it ?	47.486319904194325
You do not look well .	83.92333330959862
Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this , but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head .	30.295993125026133
You are severe on us .	76.1060327693729
and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me , because you have always so much .	25.201890915293795
Very true , my dear , that is exactly what I say .	43.04997033175317
Collins was punctual to his time , and was received with great politeness by the whole family .	35.92907665319714
One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man , with family , fortune , every thing in his favour , should think highly of himself .	30.821013123790006
and if you persist in indifference , do not make me your confidante .	27.439541941866413
and when occasionally , unable to resist the impulse of curiosity , she raised her eyes to his face , she as often found him looking at Jane , as at herself , and frequently on no object but the ground .	18.883485445964432
My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this .	40.36291494220688
Elizabeth longed to explore its windings ;	39.96602264026097
and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of , she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours .	24.466529293873265
You are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room , said Darcy , looking at the eldest Miss Bennet .	23.425341348889223
But you are always giving her the preference .	75.62053949552501
I am confident that she would have performed delightfully .	29.915824388525053
You shall not defend her , though it is Charlotte Lucas .	43.3601163872387
Darcy is impatient to see his sister , and to confess the truth , we are scarcely less eager to meet her again .	33.15557860614199
After this period , every appearance of acquaintance was dropt .	60.458010186864165
As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not , she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind .	32.95857375535323
how I wanted you !	198.75276728735602
She wrote again when the visit was paid , and she had seen Miss Bingley .	32.376321963778075
This cannot be !	211.2922387336839
What think you of books ?	162.78995006272103
But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them .	41.9190408712708
And yours , he replied with a smile , is wilfully to misunderstand them .	36.34442217952349
His accompanying them was a double advantage ;	61.582304125025175
and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness .	23.705057846496643
On such encouragement to ask , Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away .	33.88118060192039
While these newly-born notions were passing in their heads , the perturbation of Elizabeth's feelings was every moment increasing .	27.529643833946974
This letter is from Collins .	176.3307595298641
Darcy , on the contrary , had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion , for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest , and from none received either attention or pleasure .	23.225391733864875
but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas .	25.441342296897705
his society was irksome , and his attachment to her must be imaginary .	43.85313576368022
It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ;	25.79523510321507
Bingley replied that he did , and made his congratulations .	66.94816309826201
Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at Brighton .	25.211828376742858
But that gentleman , looking at Darcy , seemed to think the country was nothing at all .	37.976073781918046
An airing would do me a great deal of good , I am sure .	37.05535537759773
Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew ;	39.51335020907283
and on her pausing , he asked her , if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends .	31.37529836877664
and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her , the worth of each was eclipsed by Bingley and Netherfield .	32.34983940399144
No , nothing at all .	106.63536848448348
The turn of your countenance I shall never forget , as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way , that would induce you to accept me .	29.661673113780456
Yes , almost every day .	87.44076707274196
but Bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished , was excessively disappointed .	33.31742406628975
I desire you will stay where you are .	48.72417760237759
though their kindness to Jane , such as it was , had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration .	33.374022269463374
How could his will be disregarded ?	72.80136247514918
Collins readily assented , and a book was produced ;	69.51299529944076
Darcy corroborated it with a bow , and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth , when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger , and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other , was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting .	16.63912592080685
It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now .	39.733399555478705
She dared not relate the other half of Darcy's letter , nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend .	23.350352343778145
On entering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo , and was immediately invited to join them ;	36.42894553900783
Lydia , my love , though you are the youngest , I dare say Bingley will dance with you at the next ball .	35.65940970934749
The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth .	24.335783340478237
She was sorry that Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them ;	29.204868078027573
The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , cake , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ;	15.968419183097751
She had always seen it with pain ;	81.16616130122291
I cannot do justice to his kindness .	66.47482714883668
Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party .	47.69055438333727
Your conjecture is totally wrong , I assure you .	46.02648417914267
and Lydia , self-willed and careless , would scarcely give them a hearing .	35.18573616077367
Hurst looked at her with astonishment .	122.56308425840913
As soon as ever Bingley comes , my dear , said Bennet , you will wait on him of course .	32.48902124520971
Indeed I do not dare .	99.86025482723927
But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence .	59.06563313252924
But she is perfectly amiable , and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies .	22.792265854418226
and she thought , more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire , than as she had seen him at Pemberley .	28.791047034465716
to Miss Lydia Bennet , ' without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or any thing .	36.42816575468395
but satisfying them instantly on that head , she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons , reading the two letters aloud , and dwelling on the postscript of the last , with trembling energy .	15.992083501228283
I should like balls infinitely better , she replied , if they were carried on in a different manner ;	28.687882315855756
and as Miss Bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to Wickham , Georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more .	17.760186867739936
He can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear .	47.90884500480282
There was too much to be thought ;	69.13209352589193
and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind , wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite .	15.091612571275089
What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant ?	51.950922948083566
But my dearest love , tell me what dish Darcy is particularly fond of , that I may have it to-morrow .	33.161322829165435
My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect .	38.7497660896434
I dare say I shall soon see them here .	43.39262239062935
While the family were in this confusion , Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them .	45.330560672341086
and in the nearness of the Parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lived in it , the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day .	20.22810840650926
while his sisters , convinced that no country advice could be of any service , recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians .	28.729722924182802
She was overpowered by shame and vexation .	37.74766455697372
Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town ;	53.60251986217487
there is nothing in that .	172.11191221333132
Why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ?	39.948741838300954
Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow , and though she could not hear a word of it , she felt as if hearing it all , and saw in the motion of his lips the words apology , Hunsford , and Lady Catherine de Bourgh .	17.125779767025822
and when the subject was revived the next morning , and she was again applied to , could readily answer , and with a proper air of indifference , that she had not really any dislike to the scheme .	21.275056159444894
and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints , they parted ;	33.97670464045951
For God's sake , say no more of his partners .	45.65397691655612
Whatever he said , was said well ;	108.91362928793062
They are gone off together from Brighton .	69.42724044335226
He knows of my being in town , I am certain , from something she said herself ;	39.649072133765294
He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant .	49.9192593825897
The prospect of such delights was very cheering , and they parted in mutual good spirits .	28.07990101092891
she still expected that it would all end well , and that every morning would bring some letter , either from Lydia or her father , to explain their proceedings , and perhaps announce the marriage .	27.129851026913183
Perhaps he had been civil , only because he felt himself at ease ;	45.18644641323298
and indeed I am quite of your opinion .	65.2898685770284
he will rant and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter .	32.59365463819418
Lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in Bingley's way .	37.569378435413206
You may remember what I told you on that point , when first we talked of it .	37.43629326234743
And they must marry !	178.7721453809808
Consider how important every moment is , in such a case .	61.74407798533676
From something that he told me in our journey hither , I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him .	32.57259427145594
Indeed , Collins , all praise of me will be unnecessary .	52.10504464943091
I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well , when she came into the room this morning .	34.850756471383015
My conduct may I fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own .	27.170912701294593
his style was not penitent , but haughty .	65.84388164438336
And even Mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it .	38.726941335032635
and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it .	36.943562956563454
Though she dared not depend upon the consequence , she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour .	36.78813330872451
On being made acquainted with the present Darcy's treatment of him , she tried to remember something of that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad , which might agree with it , and was confident at last , that she recollected having heard Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud , ill-natured boy .	17.52383330695772
To all the objections I have already urged , I have still another to add .	42.25586879873154
There was another reason too for her opposition .	58.76406874195109
for she only came , I suppose , to tell us the Collinses were well .	48.89729368534053
I am only resolved to act in that manner , which will , in my own opinion , constitute my happiness , without reference to you , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me .	24.529037939590943
'Ah !	662.9770795749859
She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved .	44.95345167871979
He has also brotherly pride , which with some brotherly affection , makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister ;	23.533045496621703
but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them ;	24.112002132978127
It was generally evident whenever they met , that he did admire her ;	33.82851141524588
as we went along , Kitty and me drew up all the blinds , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ;	28.137258960216517
I am talking of possibilities , Charles .	39.848800996379154
because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth .	45.388249089983724
Mama , cried Lydia , my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they first came ;	27.193761991965523
You have said quite enough , madam .	91.33515596626853
Brighton , and a whole campful of soldiers , to us , who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia , and the monthly balls of Meryton .	20.45204807540471
He readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for her distress , wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope , and leaving his compliments for her relations , with only one serious , parting , look , went away .	19.148059404688833
and unwilling for her sister's sake , to provoke him , she only said in reply , with a good-humoured smile , Come , Wickham , we are brother and sister , you know .	21.807555015446248
As he spoke there was a sort of smile , which Elizabeth fancied she understood ;	35.04521561010179
E below .	284.22119945198097
And she rose as she spoke .	101.59639089333719
Well !	856.1141632112523
There is nothing else to be done .	65.62957726264268
His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece ;	54.823301578947934
But she had never felt so strongly as now , the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage , nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents ;	19.943231446825983
I thought too ill of him , to invite him to Pemberley , or admit his society in town .	28.92567414730684
But while he was mortal , there must be a triumph .	37.135341357495854
I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest , there is no occasion for any thing more .	24.37801526614498
It is a great comfort to have you so rich , and when you have nothing else to do , I hope you will think of us .	28.05270536128294
Do not distress me by the idea .	78.80879224097106
Nothing is more deceitful , said Darcy , than the appearance of humility .	42.27715678587096
Jane was not deceived , but she was affected ;	64.14828740882143
and if you lament over him much longer , my heart will be as light as a feather .	28.316238656863188
It is a pity they are not handsome !	53.77877195148614
what is it about ?	273.17574567489106
But Jane and Elizabeth , who agreed in wishing , for the sake of their sister's feelings and consequence , that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents , urged him so earnestly , yet so rationally and so mildly , to receive her and her husband at Longbourn , as soon as they were married , that he was prevailed on to think as they thought , and act as they wished .	18.915127677312253
Her face is too thin ;	119.53871862749763
Their visits to Philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence .	44.321563354209346
of what are you thinking ?	204.99719766209495
It was in the Times and the Courier , I know ;	32.30973411084449
and fourthly , that the match might be broken off .	36.264903431409365
She felt that Jane's feelings , though fervent , were little displayed , and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner , not often united with great sensibility .	23.048475319736628
I must not decide on my own performance .	47.7772207471707
Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible ;	17.377664830465665
but when Philips understood from him what Rosings was , and who was its proprietor , when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms , and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all the force of the compliment , and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper's room .	14.17321392172231
There is nothing the matter with me .	81.16698256514684
And as to laughter , we will not expose ourselves , if you please , by attempting to laugh without a subject .	27.123161974247488
Here again I shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell .	60.996264842997476
Well , Colonel Fitzwilliam , what do I play next ?	50.38925187679808
Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp , and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table , and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley's .	18.428706005097215
He shall be mercenary , and she shall be foolish .	43.1744660421238
They were all of them warm in their admiration ;	70.99640593276429
These recollections will not do at all .	89.90383815806246
secondly , she was very sure that Collins had been taken in ;	56.1550705987712
The garden sloping to the road , the house standing in it , the green pales and the laurel hedge , every thing declared they were arriving .	16.805470461862445
Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption , while the servants remained .	50.23867734751281
Human nature is so prone to fall into it !	56.95393100212926
Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions , all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US unless a copyright notice is included .	20.202964560063116
Never mind Miss Lizzy's hair .	96.43982062180741
Wickham will soon be gone ;	199.3676826509311
but , stopping on his approach , received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome .	32.93849236013021
Oh !	298.0706733468098
Had Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle , she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself ;	29.400072575525133
Collins was also in the same state of angry pride .	50.619718025944906
Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered .	52.99120698859774
The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon , and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her that she was not enough recovered ;	21.817101160558977
and I find that the young man forgot to tell you , among his other communications , that he was the son of old Wickham , the late Darcy's steward .	21.170545222098184
But nothing can be done ;	94.68570956249535
but Elizabeth , to satisfy her mother , went to the window she looked , she saw Darcy with him , and sat down again by her sister .	27.523507219140765
He then sat down by her , and talked scarcely to any one else .	37.56988505799444
Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject .	70.97580630609826
How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day !	48.557661110036186
and if she might judge from his complexion , his mind was not very differently engaged .	36.811724869465884
I have not been accustomed to such language as this .	44.50622303376026
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection .	36.981423907394024
It was rather small , but well built and convenient ;	42.045609892157124
but Bennet was firm : it soon led to another ;	52.15050077979281
Next time you call , said she , I hope we shall be more lucky .	45.94675350439487
CHAPTER X Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter , as soon as she possibly could .	29.119446601296325
This preservative she had now obtained ;	81.08310240449202
Every thing , however , went on smoothly , and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch .	23.12448204497553
I was uncomfortable enough .	78.72726330394107
Gardiner , who was several years younger than Bennet and Philips , was an amiable , intelligent , elegant woman , and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces .	26.912654179761407
Yes ;	506.5076850786652
Undoubtedly .	752.6775965577506
Darcy smiled and said , You are perfectly right .	65.62232329628165
I wish I could call her amiable .	62.39076634699372
He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere , if not with equal regard .	49.55447912678719
but it is wholly out of my power .	61.776498002959016
There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter , which promises well .	23.07819807156112
This idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view ;	41.227037776387185
it must be my uncle's doings !	92.83715445294963
Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother , on her ladyship's entrance , though no request of introduction had been made .	33.23477761762797
He was fond of the country and of books ;	57.9779936151322
and in her postscript it was added , that if Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer , she could spare them very well .	26.858999865818962
How so ?	380.1806300289357
He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment , on account of some debts of honour , which were very pressing ;	29.876064158480894
They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation ;	30.329958290522754
Bingley was the principal spokesman , and Miss Bennet the principal object .	48.917876855333745
She blushed at the very idea ;	73.69162253206488
He is indeed but considering the inducement , my dear Miss Eliza , we cannot wonder at his complaisance ;	28.243006858737363
When they were all in the drawing-room , the questions which Elizabeth had already asked , were of course repeated by the others , and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give .	30.608779989416448
But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour ;	51.58048363567401
I should imagine not .	101.5785065533485
Darcy , you see , is the man !	124.55776235208376
Probably not ;	363.25670730606896
there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home , how she would like Lady Catherine , and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be ;	27.786987339989246
You may as well call it impertinence at once .	49.74526418953354
Away ran the girls , too eager to get in to have time for speech .	48.255562477873426
The insipidity and yet the noise ;	70.8345496712634
and from this time Bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them .	41.90639910489746
and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again .	23.113766983195358
and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world , he was caught by their easy playfulness .	18.020920295053315
Darcy , as well as Elizabeth , really loved them ;	50.29485387775597
It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends .	33.29308094719028
She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas , who often joined them , and good-naturedly engaged Collins's conversation to herself .	20.979466024085013
In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health , imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better .	27.69591971476617
Jane was distressed .	189.87266872472279
My kind friends will not hear of my returning home till I am better .	38.49883760998785
what news ?	508.1479655748987
for the curiosity excited by his long absence , burst forth in such very direct questions on his return , as required some ingenuity to evade , and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial , for he was longing to publish his prosperous love .	14.437728360965322
She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened ;	42.05545959384829
She will not be able to help calling .	45.28757223057104
His character sunk on every review of it ;	62.24804266920741
said he ;	404.09077883289314
Eliza Bennet , said Miss Bingley , when the door was closed on her , is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex , by undervaluing their own ;	24.46384847992038
On both sides it was only assertion .	79.04413374398267
though perhaps it was lucky for her husband , who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form , that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly .	21.12850488573434
Their society can afford no pleasure , that will atone for such wretchedness as this !	42.65346367377031
Let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied .	60.034206461502144
no .	1002.6479946958726
He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood ;	33.95938236088113
We seem to have been designed for each other .	44.4080555134427
I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your's .	35.14828945910123
Where is your sister ?	221.76135975497414
I did for you .	122.2163480324828
Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand ;	32.02259394516284
and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months .	50.88055809737308
Easter was approaching , and the week preceding it , was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings , which in so small a circle must be important .	26.036956509001584
There was certainly at this moment , in Elizabeth's mind , a more gentle sensation towards the original , than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance .	25.90911088300456
As he quitted the room , Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire ;	24.738788318905925
indeed , you must have seen it in the papers .	61.58378479678722
I can answer your question , said Fitzwilliam , without applying to him .	36.935403212258926
In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother , though expressed most concisely , he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done , and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him .	18.792103865648937
nor could she for a moment repent her refusal , or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again .	34.44531230506365
And so saying , he turned back with them , and walked towards the house .	32.575621034793315
How can they suit each other ?	78.95125170405431
Oh !	298.0706733468098
Can he be a sensible man , sir ?	75.71711691158596
Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room , to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself .	27.66746249001875
But , my dear Elizabeth , she added , what sort of girl is Miss King ?	33.56682003853908
But , however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination , I do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage , had it not been seconded by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving , of your sister's indifference .	19.94051720728939
Do not wish me such an evil .	72.85658666029771
But there was much to be talked of , in marrying her ;	45.99199427050294
He begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother ;	37.96262363750116
At length , quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book , which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his , she gave a great yawn and said , How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way !	20.94246158615078
To Caroline's assertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit .	32.274995566010276
and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt , than to run such a risk .	30.696379758167406
I rather wished , than believed him to be sincere ;	46.14388225954522
He heard her attentively , and then said , Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances .	25.31943402156916
Elizabeth could bear it no longer .	96.29705960358423
I assure you , that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it .	28.040165647926663
Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual .	96.14583135830648
If they had uncles enough to fill all Cheapside , cried Bingley , it would not make them one jot less agreeable .	22.43178624126095
Both , replied Elizabeth archly ;	114.16506734324021
You have now done your duty by her , and must fret no longer .	35.738776268850344
but if she is really headstrong and foolish , I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state .	27.517090472662534
Elizabeth , equally next to Jane in birth and beauty , succeeded her of course .	39.68274459206044
and the gown which had been let down to hide it , not doing its office .	28.58407946101185
Let me be rightly understood .	70.04832940603075
Because honour , decorum , prudence , nay , interest , forbid it .	27.108527334699513
and she seized the opportunity of saying , Is your sister at Pemberley still ?	29.516659833177275
on Tuesday , his wife received a letter from him ;	80.52442398770395
It was acknowledged , however , that he was a liberal man , and did much good among the poor .	22.52861605478492
The first wish of my heart , said she to herself , is never more to be in company with either of them .	33.09176746863715
in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and I dare say it would succeed , if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way .	26.40785332643846
Darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence .	70.57735070238485
she had seen enough of Bingley's behaviour to Jane , to be convinced that she would get him at last ;	35.63026292774158
About the Court , such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon .	40.647730739645695
I have not an instant to lose .	75.3517214100563
Don't think me angry , however , for I only mean to let you know , that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side .	29.127498793631773
Bennet was quite disconcerted .	147.55332890839097
A lively imagination soon settled it all .	78.91603357402649
E7 and any additional terms imposed by the copyright holder .	43.52673573997797
He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem .	39.961859588592915
When my eyes were opened to his real character .	57.12475418185798
Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged , by the scarcity of gentlemen , to sit down for two dances ;	31.958170148064468
How strange this is !	161.54091989040137
what felicity !	508.86707379346376
I should be glad to take a turn in it , if you will favour me with your company .	31.745703904025532
and I was convinced of her affection .	76.2002836342111
Her home and her housekeeping , her parish and her poultry , and all their dependent concerns , had not yet lost their charms .	29.42196078920355
and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls ;	29.389760395817618
They soon outstripped the others , and when they had reached the carriage , and Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind .	24.408000717197748
But if he returns no more this winter , my choice will never be required .	30.2718974600557
Your first position is false .	94.29669136917487
and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him .	28.53423164493218
Five daughters brought up at home without a governess !	62.85971844203895
What does Darcy mean , said she to Charlotte , by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster ?	34.620600801105
There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men .	41.21454637914394
I will go directly to Bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , I am sure .	25.556467162842303
She smiled , but made no answer .	52.60226855364105
As to his real character , had information been in her power , she had never felt a wish of enquiring .	36.82227160750571
Darcy was delighted with their engagement ;	107.9889043758662
Bingley had danced with her twice , and she had been distinguished by his sisters .	33.66800066586507
But if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal it , he must find it out .	26.742797046683247
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged , every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him .	24.01767817983175
- You provide , in accordance with paragraph 1 .	37.8322272358819
and , as he had likewise foretold , he took his seat at the bottom of the table , by her ladyship's desire , and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater .	20.125404824208488
A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her , a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude , and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter .	20.578405448985475
Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile , but Elizabeth could not return it .	41.148687848271926
It would have been strange if they had .	48.980927038699924
every thing must sink under such a proof of family weakness , such an assurance of the deepest disgrace .	23.199123927553092
She has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject , to give greater what shall I call it ?	30.241973100262296
and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance , especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again .	23.17172203248784
When the ladies returned to the drawing-room , there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk , which she did without any intermission till coffee came in , delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted .	20.764382440619112
And her neighbours at Lucas lodge , therefore , ( for through their communication with the Collinses , the report she concluded had reached lady Catherine ) had only set that down , as almost certain and immediate , which she had looked forward to as possible , at some future time .	21.38767493897203
I really cannot laugh at it .	69.16060227213059
The Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan S Fairbanks , AK , 99712 .	12.450795246041361
the door was thrown open , and she ran into the room .	37.467631914764205
Perhaps this concealment , this disguise , was beneath me .	60.11294976887856
Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion , and complimented her on bearing it so well .	30.659875550852068
But , my dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me obstinate if I still assert , that , considering what her behaviour was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion .	24.573652699744077
Do you suppose them to be in London ?	78.37681576852833
Once or twice she could discern a faint blush ;	41.37626712429028
But , however , that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here , I am determined .	24.282368619090594
But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into , was shortly relieved , and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope , by an article of news , which then began to be in circulation .	21.735062965073976
Can I speak plainer ?	153.77115781298525
Some time or other he will be but it shall not be by me .	49.73736272432096
As they went down stairs together , Charlotte said , I shall depend on hearing from you very often , Eliza .	37.47690156595428
I have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse .	41.58792290759299
By nature inoffensive , friendly and obliging , his presentation at James's had made him courteous .	31.560074976108936
he had looked at her without admiration at the ball ;	63.89647041641864
But , in my opinion , it is a paltry device , a very mean art .	32.36888513605242
His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear .	46.3755677231993
She must own that she was tired of great houses ;	41.63014332050346
But if it be only a slight , thin sort of inclination , I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away .	21.212445886510505
Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us , which becomes herself and daughter .	24.418065444962977
Laugh as much as you chuse , but you will not laugh me out of my opinion .	39.76366518637493
What do I not owe you !	93.49277673346036
Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies ;	49.13259187986227
There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire .	41.990361271490166
It is excellent news , capital news , and about a certain person that we all like .	30.10386300242493
you sly thing !	266.7940594450155
On Miss Lucas's persevering , however , she added , Very well ;	30.59268304490636
I found , said he , as the time drew near , that I had better not meet Darcy ;	38.35131887637056
She then read the first sentence aloud , which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly , and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street , where Hurst had a house .	24.805459599014057
but his father's uncommon attachment to me , irritated him I believe very early in life .	30.373041276839214
Elizabeth hoped she had silenced him ;	63.00025109731872
You want to tell me , and I have no objection to hearing it .	30.274400555132882
Amongst the most violent against him was Bennet , whose dislike of his general behaviour , was sharpened into particular resentment , by his having slighted one of her daughters .	25.74194412611739
Yes , Ma'am , that he was indeed ;	47.96056714899116
In consequence of an agreement between the sisters , Elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother , to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day .	25.45200047288487
With his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous , contained much good sense and solid reasoning .	23.46286878519913
Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education , and who has lived in the world , is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers ?	27.804469738551326
On Sunday , after morning service , the separation , so agreeable to almost all , took place .	43.86174983375851
As a brother , a landlord , a master , she considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship !	33.84955736341357
You shall have it in few words .	93.24080934824346
I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden , and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter !	22.824116544444728
In such an exigence my uncle's advice and assistance would be every thing in the world ;	26.77393664359265
So much the better .	165.5765029945374
And tell my dear Lydia , not to give any directions about her clothes , till she has seen me , for she does not know which are the best warehouses .	29.28055244278656
On Saturday he came again .	126.40079809675869
but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way , and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow evening .	18.37240999846758
Yet in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin Elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may incur , by a precipitate closure with this gentleman's proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of .	19.635429194554632
it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Bingley's being there ;	39.16403193443815
There is a gentleman with him , mamma , said Kitty ;	43.73311322931901
The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her .	28.76234047577585
After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event , which Elizabeth considered as all but certain , and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible ;	22.755103134472684
Lydia the humiliation , the misery , she was bringing on them all , soon swallowed up every private care ;	37.3237594583965
Go , my dear , cried her mother , and shew her ladyship about the different walks .	30.594791692269922
Lady Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes , and consideration for his comfort , appeared very remarkable .	22.762395461028785
it remains to be told why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where I assure you there are many amiable young women .	26.400094812546918
and he afterwards took occasion to ask her , when unattended to by any of the rest , whether all her sisters were at Longbourn .	31.672016187170048
But I was embarrassed .	94.22590547702103
A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern .	60.02274887067732
It cannot be done too much ;	73.75789515487476
Elizabeth , with a triumphant sensation , looked towards his friend .	38.99473310169423
Are you out of your senses , to be accepting this man ?	38.96791509316293
Oh !	298.0706733468098
So much the better .	165.5765029945374
Oh !	298.0706733468098
Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint ;	24.290305211889063
But he is a liberal master , I suppose , and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue .	24.786067483313097
I shall see her in January .	66.31064544042563
and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married .	28.9008862038912
He has a very satirical eye , and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself , I shall soon grow afraid of him .	19.795029757825585
Elizabeth , who knew this to be levelled at Darcy , was in such misery of shame , that she could hardly keep her seat .	27.752678160917057
how I should like to be married before any of you ;	75.81938731618509
It must be his own doing .	84.26808380194545
Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment , and then replied , The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind .	28.195768635939846
Bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Darcy ;	28.16712903563701
and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress ;	35.38039605057284
They then went away .	108.14657101771044
Their reception at home was most kind .	98.71934286892895
There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again ;	52.566409064337
Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast , and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before .	28.26196130756855
I must speak to Hill , this moment .	57.40354736660735
But I know the foundation is unjust .	56.05617767565554
It was absolutely necessary , therefore , to think of something , and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in Hertfordshire , and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure , she observed , How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November , Darcy !	16.883308540727757
Darcy is not to be laughed at !	75.66343036153471
The party did not supply much conversation .	57.54019792819944
But do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us ?	43.38534518435773
Having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and from her age and disposition , greater steadiness than first attachments often boast ;	22.766249872470617
Pleased with the preference of one , and offended by the neglect of the other , on the very beginning of our acquaintance , I have courted prepossession and ignorance , and driven reason away , where either were concerned .	19.576531569154355
When alone with Elizabeth afterwards , she spoke more on the subject .	56.56395240160865
Never , since reading Jane's second letter , had she entertained a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her .	37.41236542419807
gave her hand with an affectionate smile to Wickham , who followed his lady , and wished them both joy , with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness .	28.931861145778004
and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ;	29.059216620693352
We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect .	37.58091581899997
and , therefore , I am not afraid of speaking openly .	33.00555853795422
He then shut the door , and coming up to her , claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister .	31.232442701938336
and it might strike them that they could be more economically , though less expeditiously , married in London , than in Scotland .	29.26582893921742
Is it not clear enough ?	144.01031647531983
and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes ;	44.32475961820773
His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case , but his reliance on mine , made every thing easy .	24.288859559713526
She looked at his two sisters , and saw them making signs of derision at each other , and at Darcy , who continued however impenetrably grave .	19.22401461415947
and , after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table , they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper , who attended , in the absence of her daughters .	26.673172208667786
He was very fond of them .	62.48565354842235
And you may be certain that when I have the honour of seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualifications .	21.409152492167923
She was not rendered formidable by silence ;	44.127033334917584
It was , on the contrary , exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes ;	32.65105624679418
Do you really think so ?	126.46457604949558
I owe all that I know of it , to another , not to you .	44.3756716401377
CHAPTER XV .	223.11563766813362
A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little .	86.06652742603738
but she was flattered and pleased .	61.28912855049177
She attracted him more than he liked and Miss Bingley was uncivil to her , and more teazing than usual to himself .	25.91365278807335
And what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her ?	37.13036371244655
Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness , openness , ductility of his temper , though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own , and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied .	22.24597242814672
In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable , and Jane to make her resigned .	32.826211925157125
But perhaps Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle .	24.591748738361375
Very true , indeed ;	162.34174154288698
Her performance was pleasing , though by no means capital .	48.18046187759449
What are we to do !	158.95250413801242
I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner .	36.99916346756729
and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark .	37.74380122507557
and when Wickham walked into the room , Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before , nor thinking of him since , with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration .	22.657155845009612
Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy , drawn when she was only eight years old .	29.33051656069806
Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail .	53.40226648420073
what it contains , has surprised me a good deal .	82.8941498430506
it will then be early enough for expectation .	86.08400495802117
I will try again .	90.3105640370651
He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire .	59.16011970980703
If I wished to think slightingly of any body's children , it should not be of my own however .	35.36367628924188
There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings !	49.25951465796579
His choice is disinterested at least , for he must know my father can give her nothing .	47.74392148507777
This is an evening of wonders , indeed !	81.81792509093434
1 .	384.9991185797929
If he had been wavering before , as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy , as dignity unblemished could make him .	20.92135473650894
it was not their wish to force her communication .	46.90690488709616
You wish to think all the world respectable , and are hurt if I speak ill of any body .	30.206697822207076
F2 .	662.9770795749859
He was received by Bennet with a degree of civility , which made her two daughters ashamed , especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend .	21.03632053705374
That is the place to get husbands .	84.94266753295419
Sir , you quite misunderstand me , said Bennet , alarmed .	55.7849560192307
engaged to Darcy !	370.8170025835209
How far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs , I cannot tell ;	36.637584363945905
and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown .	45.34101610911157
only think !	635.1423667447166
But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley .	34.43639093856103
and then you may say whatever you like of me .	62.04965976237215
Gardiner was standing a little behind ;	106.78349116614523
His behaviour to her sister was such , during dinner time , as shewed an admiration of her , which , though more guarded than formerly , persuaded Elizabeth , that if left wholly to himself , Jane's happiness , and his own , would be speedily secured .	21.624436337642777
He paused in hopes of an answer ;	59.90364938526698
but I hope this may be false .	65.07405873929575
But I think Darcy improves on acquaintance .	55.82553843707545
Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , reflecting on what she had heard , and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it , when Sir William Lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family .	18.001605717137313
It is a rule with me , that a person who can write a long letter , with ease , cannot write ill .	28.570313711442473
I know little of the game , at present , said he , but I shall be glad to improve myself , for in my situation of life Philips was very thankful for his compliance , but could not wait for his reason .	22.585792145568302
For such an attachment as this , she might have sufficient charms ;	48.80155731035027
On the strength of Darcy's regard Bingley had the firmest reliance , and of his judgment the highest opinion .	27.7613857634604
With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Bingley and talked of Darcy may be guessed .	38.79532585559422
He walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind ;	24.91898746497921
I am not going to run away , Papa , said Kitty , fretfully ;	20.840646509050273
Her not objecting , does not justify him .	50.18472604081342
I am sorry to pain you but so it was .	45.20897601582839
Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in undiminished beauty ;	64.40523959120877
for Lady Catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men .	21.415107649420637
She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place , and accordingly began by observing , that his arrival had been very unexpected for your housekeeper , she added , informed us that you would certainly not be here till to-morrow ;	18.742058678448203
Oh !	298.0706733468098
there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded , and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time .	27.52103370669694
He looked surprised , displeased , alarmed ;	57.310853487912645
In a moment they were all out of the chaise , rejoicing at the sight of each other .	26.140500410010933
I wish this may be more intelligible , but though not confined for time , my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent .	26.283572746344866
and on the part of Bennet and Kitty , though she was perfectly unknown to them , even inferior to what Elizabeth felt .	32.2742240840592
Eager to be alone , and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt , she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley , and then hurried away to dress .	17.819061045833823
His countenance , voice , and manner , had established him at once in the possession of every virtue .	30.094018057551747
He assured her that as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ;	47.645833427901785
Already arisen !	284.49805305081156
an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope , that by the following Christmas , she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day , unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war-office , another regiment should be quartered in Meryton .	21.001724499149827
Ah !	531.6294007955007
On the evening before my going to London , said he I made a confession to him , which I believe I ought to have made long ago .	26.490826304974494
As they passed into other rooms , these objects were taking different positions ;	35.0624244175273
The path just admitted three .	72.0881390465863
her's lasted a little longer ;	133.59966288479671
Do not let us quarrel about the past .	50.85130499543617
He was a tall , heavy looking young man of five and twenty .	30.153209589565837
Elizabeth was not comfortable ;	110.11293479853343
But I dare not hope it .	78.6365739060046
The strangeness of Collins's making two offers of marriage within three days , was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted .	28.850878454509036
and if you are not kind to us , brother , I do not know what we shall do .	25.78778766144378
Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports , by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under .	21.31440277278344
but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship , I suspect his gratitude misleads him , and that in spite of her being his patroness , she is an arrogant , conceited woman .	20.453821600433113
But it is of small importance .	77.00706262859813
Your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct , I am sure .	42.868894812488435

Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself ;	31.04970004689531
I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one .	36.61482258178415
By all that I have ever read , I am convinced that it is very common indeed , that human nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other , real or imaginary .	16.751424223504394
At night she opened her heart to Jane .	99.17709320223182
That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Bingley and Jane , she had never doubted ;	27.41161231648075
Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner ;	64.53862466942297
I roused , and interested you , because I was so unlike them .	29.50453693664565
Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty .	33.48198145410648
and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared with his friend .	21.68819696988184
Put them next to your great uncle the judge .	76.69088110740933
She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done , and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct .	23.43005294358558
And which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty ?	39.62040726248055
My dear Lizzy , you cannot think me so weak , as to be in danger now .	36.0460660129158
She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself , in their first evening at Philips's .	36.11507872979468
I wish it may .	135.08748038978587
She approached , and saw the likeness of Wickham suspended , amongst several other miniatures , over the mantle-piece .	24.575439222319034
but on beholding it , ( for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library , ) he started back , and begging pardon , protested that he never read novels .	16.539746413529553
When she thought of her mother indeed , her confidence gave way a little , but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with Darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend's connections , than from their want of sense ;	21.590807537965016
The very last evening was spent there ;	81.40999657756473
and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to .	23.17353810274212
CHAPTER XX .	249.51422743723455
Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand .	74.89800552042597
The children have been wanting me this half hour .	41.42276219174473
To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed , she soon afterwards said , I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal .	23.430140192061117
DEAR SIR , I must trouble you once more for congratulations .	46.84863537926856
After breakfast , the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Wickham were returned , and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball .	33.32687368708451
By Hurst and Miss Bingley , they were noticed only by a curtsey ;	35.17347307114448
and she was quite decided at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining Bingley for his sister .	16.642493178670225
She could have added , A young man too , like you , whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable but she contented herself with And one , too , who had probably been his own companion from childhood , connected together , as I think you said , in the closest manner !	19.46055936504128
the ladies had crowded round the table , where Miss Bennet was making tea , and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee , in so close a confederacy , that there was not a single vacancy near her , which would admit of a chair .	20.02611756933826
She is a most charming young lady indeed .	48.224321480034725
This matter may be considered , therefore , as finally settled .	38.61482470566274
Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go , merely on that account , for in general you know they visit no new comers .	30.80683986718935
I never saw any one so shocked .	59.39360779054307
and if I were determined to get a rich husband , or any husband , I dare say I should adopt it .	22.922531559454498
I cannot find out that I hate her at all , or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl .	28.317960449844197
but Collins , much offended , laid aside his book , and said , I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp , though written solely for their benefit .	19.11468298896795
but her letters were always long expected , and always very short .	49.919453430398136
but their progress was slow , for Gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little .	16.077022240544125
has thrown herself into the power of of Wickham .	63.72951619469316
To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever .	50.622827033528566
Elizabeth had settled it that Darcy would bring his sister to visit her , the very day after her reaching Pemberley ;	42.397295175532435
He is also handsome , replied Elizabeth , which a young man ought likewise to be , if he possibly can .	29.000160560954512
and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects , which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world .	30.55236133428876
and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford , they reached Gardiner's house , where they were to remain a few days .	26.688487257288546
whether he had been aware of Jane's attachment , or whether it had escaped his observation ;	38.792642688161266
I suspected as much , replied Elizabeth .	59.58320136867509
and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there , to know the rest .	39.38043489795323
He has made me so happy , said she , one evening , by telling me , that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring !	26.13653123634344
Collins was gratified ;	198.40970124067078
She has one only daughter , the heiress of Rosings , and of very extensive property .	32.241402477497104
Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips .	32.490940080965316
and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter .	37.28157028250921
Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon .	49.70285416675284
Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty ;	68.99372899343025
but , however , do not speak to Darcy about it , if you had rather not .	35.57648066298257
Gardiner , whose manners were easy and pleasant , encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks ;	29.174225790285302
She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire ;	36.967285337510006
When they parted , Lady Catherine , with great condescension , wished them a good journey , and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year ;	25.185047140246837
said he , as he joined her .	98.63143191448708
I wonder that the very pride of this Darcy has not made him just to you !	49.470033415729894
E1 through 1 .	147.104373704791
for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing .	40.53653653718425
I will not trust myself on the subject , replied Wickham , I can hardly be just to him .	32.77729946566623
Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendance , and when immediately before my father's death , Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me , I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him , as of affection to myself .	20.84379335854962
and Elizabeth sorry for her , and sorry for her father's speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no good .	31.114832408658362
CHAPTER XII .	234.75576465601785
Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham ;	37.13718030717045
It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family .	29.485223354955085
Occupied in observing Bingley's attentions to her sister , Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend .	20.114034823995524
but his friend Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine , tall person , handsome features , noble mien ;	24.372894376276655
To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit <URL> While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements , we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate .	14.222182394332021
Hurst sang with her sister , and while they were thus employed Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument , how frequently Darcy's eyes were fixed on her .	19.962434390150893
Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him , I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds , or any thing like it , has been advanced .	23.342627473994362
After welcoming their sisters , they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords , exclaiming , Is not this nice ?	18.330949963804493
To these high flown expressions , Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ;	31.53644340894235
the satisfaction of Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face , as made her look handsomer than ever .	26.34462079410209
come into my room .	198.10251235352305
It is difficult indeed it is distressing .	49.85286839347954
And so , you like this man's sisters too , do you ?	56.30945364807845
and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern , when Kitty left them , she went boldly on with him alone .	31.084006849410283
Collins on his return highly gratified Bennet by admiring Philips's manners and politeness .	39.207091059538335
I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine , that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess , and that the most elevated rank , instead of giving her consequence , would be adorned by her .	16.22264408660559
So imprudent a match on both sides !	85.41243825751862
If I can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too .	34.53891605876238
But , Lizzy !	178.17789722336138
Seriously , I would have you be on your guard .	76.74633013347793
And do you impute it to either of those ?	61.90137622342571
but as she reached the door , it was opened by a servant , and Darcy appeared .	34.32951741962388
She complained bitterly of all this to her husband .	47.71124187416765
You are very cruel , said her sister , you will not let me smile , and are provoking me to it every moment .	25.33925777561997
I have already told her so once , by your desire .	51.97157642443629
Though I know it must be a scandalous falsehood ;	64.26597443772351
Not at all .	193.70708254992613
all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return .	48.40540689331831
My dear Charles , what do you mean ?	57.30375729869875
Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained ;	32.720851721214736
Heaven and earth !	202.73785088788532

The Miss Webbs all play , and their father has not so good an income as your's .	29.724032086088556
for while he was present , Jane had no attention to bestow on any one else ;	43.90543304350465
Come , Kitty , I want you up stairs .	62.25569739319598
I must confess myself surprised by your application ;	54.58633633582879
On opening the door , she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth , as if engaged in earnest conversation ;	30.58131258989828
He was the proudest , most disagreeable man in the world , and every body hoped that he would never come there again .	24.362542809527735
I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be .	34.1350872930641
I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours , he coldly replied .	28.59004085228043
Yes , indeed ;	180.45583651017012
Astonishment , apprehension , and even horror , oppressed her .	43.75196296213682
and her Ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey , gave them directions as to the best method of packing , and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way , that Maria thought herself obliged , on her return , to undo all the work of the morning , and pack her trunk afresh .	13.520617150688471
As for Wickham and Lydia , their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters .	31.957889430456056
I quite detest the man .	80.94773698481202
She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Darcy that Darcy might leave the country , but that he should stand his ground ;	27.081935678673517
You have a house in town , I conclude ?	55.744347269071525
Of the lady's sensations they remained a little in doubt ;	60.578865765442465
My avowed one , or what I avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which I have since made .	26.648758328002724
She saw with the creative eye of fancy , the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers .	18.79093611483455
The distance is nothing , when one has a motive ;	64.05753045710429
To know that her daughter would be married was enough .	74.95911279206952
And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing , that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood , before she was banished to the North .	22.2574031099538
You mentioned two instances .	111.0831951279439
I take up my pen again to do , what I have just told you I would not , but circumstances are such , that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here , as soon as possible .	25.28741266331205
No I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did .	47.78936715444756
Darcy said very little , and Hurst nothing at all .	63.80894291832694
and already had Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping , when an answer arrived which deferred it all .	23.138149407076035
It could not be for society , as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips ;	28.889086805469663
All this she must possess , added Darcy , and to all this she must yet add something more substantial , in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading .	28.62304846773359
It is settled between us already , that we are to be the happiest couple in the world .	29.184224326028236
But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede .	31.78254673103573
You mistake me , my dear .	68.85309818738946
And will you promise me , never to enter into such an engagement ?	46.78262990094639
The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases , and again during the chief of the day , was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Collins .	20.79448939111506
You began the evening well , Charlotte , said Bennet with civil self-command to Miss Lucas .	38.2473875609415
Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in July , and must be in London again within a month ;	27.050659842871518
Hurst thought the same , and added , She has nothing , in short , to recommend her , but being an excellent walker .	37.79899431158441
and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks .	26.2474208735503
but she was satisfied with none .	61.81338064435524
Indeed , you are mistaken , I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here .	27.196080343725516
I thought we never should have got into the coach .	43.22745671804379
She wished , she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them ;	34.92494013729733
Oh !	298.0706733468098
for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to Darcy were by no means over .	34.70504287066427
and I know I appeared distressed .	72.71046368278634
But you do not know all .	76.42114300031815
He absolutely started , and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise ;	37.592673954469205
It does seem , and it is most shocking indeed , replied Elizabeth , with tears in her eyes , that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt .	20.301542864079046
She went on .	145.2019848558853
Nay , cried Bingley , this is too much , to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning .	33.942248979546484
How thankful am I , that we never let them know what has been said against him ;	45.45514326292055
She had also to anticipate how her visit would pass , the quiet tenor of their usual employments , the vexatious interruptions of Collins , and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings .	16.5053875800617
During their walk , it was resolved that Bennet's consent should be asked in the course of the evening .	29.99067580737958
She says Lizzy had better have taken Collins ;	67.10998991583462
This information made Elizabeth smile , as she thought of poor Miss Bingley .	41.228162965129656
but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown , before they are packed up .	20.992112210528326
No sooner did he appear , than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed ;	33.191225085210284
I can safely say , that every advance to intimacy began on her side .	30.624813949789083
It was really a very handsome thought .	72.80137875162123
perhaps that was the reason of his silence ;	106.25292896868419
You know him too well to doubt the rest .	77.48408520697312
That is an uncommon advantage , and uncommon I hope it will continue , for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance .	25.016800587523804
but where other powers of entertainment are wanting , the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given .	24.20116709195979
Miss Bennet's lovely face confirmed his views , and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority ;	22.061045921780472
But no such recollection befriended her .	57.42943754747932
In this danger Kitty is also comprehended .	73.58085527389585
and then rising up , said to Elizabeth , Miss Bennet , there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn .	19.953296007381752
Is not general incivility the very essence of love ?	63.55298456549552
nonsense , how can you talk so !	100.53560990362806
We have dined nine times at Rosings , besides drinking tea there twice !	26.560913330347734
cried he , with more feeling than politeness ;	97.59666570569453
His behaviour to myself has been scandalous ;	65.1001316278903
and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire-place , that she might be farther from the door .	24.95778948522213
but his companion was not disposed to make any ;	56.91494296923859
and , at last , on the young lady's whispering to Elizabeth again , he walked away .	38.05242429210851
Allowing the case , however , to stand according to your representation , you must remember , Miss Bennet , that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house , and the delay of his plan , has merely desired it , asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety .	19.515808846494675
I feel as if I had never done you justice , or loved you as you deserve .	40.26977114800349
Their fortune on both sides is splendid .	72.66901214447827
I remain , dear sir , with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters , your well-wisher and friend , WILLIAM COLLINS .	20.779176711569587
She then ran gaily off , rejoicing as she rambled about , in the hope of being at home again in a day or two .	25.17742589010439
In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ?	41.58351009498261
susceptibility to her feelings ;	202.9482695773395
Not all that Bennet , however , with the assistance of her five daughters , could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Bingley .	23.32120337129401
It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it .	36.145994197548134
I have not been used to submit to any person's whims .	30.717815998249126
Oh !	298.0706733468098
And what sort of table do they keep ?	54.85484928855811
but this was declined , and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness .	37.25179273282794
It will pass away soon enough .	71.1089437540001
There is nothing like dancing after all .	69.11119126899897
The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to Wickham's charge , exceedingly shocked her ;	24.31275979695277
and all was soon right again .	90.91121364904704
but I dare say he may spend half his time here ;	43.39784879571301
therefore , stay quietly at Longbourn , and depend on my diligence and care .	31.483449357696657
so tall !	461.0876090022293
In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity ;	44.00271731016948
or allow her to hear it from any one but myself .	83.67357518062339
and when at length they turned in at the lodge , her spirits were in a high flutter .	31.652040148978237
First of all , he asked Miss Lucas .	101.85814035847007
She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height , or rather taller .	40.08818731252361
Elizabeth soon heard from her friend ;	111.56034333984857
None at all .	197.40502073911645
Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again .	57.24303295350155
They must all go to Brighton .	99.27520681077189
he had felt their importance in the family circle .	69.51138423534918
It may perhaps be pleasant , replied Charlotte , to be able to impose on the public in such a case ;	26.209688056665026
and in the latter object , where she feared most to fail , she was most sure of success , for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour .	25.960858135248095
The moment of her release from him was ecstacy .	44.223587035587585
Nay , said Elizabeth , this is not fair .	60.92244641423592
They left Brighton together on Sunday night , and were traced almost to London , but not beyond ;	34.09435013344222
I have not a doubt of your doing very well together .	44.40001046811108
What do you mean , Hill ?	85.89118133336169
and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away .	18.438790158826073
Nothing of the past was recollected with pain ;	76.89883860072395
it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life .	42.78607959238833
She had dressed with more than usual care , and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart , trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening .	16.5171938735013
and besides , it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body , and had so many favourites .	21.066731403246262
Unfortunately an only son , ( for many years an only child ) I was spoilt by my parents , who though good themselves , ( my father particularly , all that was benevolent and amiable , ) allowed , encouraged , almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing , to care for none beyond my own family circle , to think meanly of all the rest of the world , to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own .	18.211851404776834
You are not going to be Missish , I hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report .	18.849639117347433
Aye that is because you have the right disposition .	84.13360089357631
she longed to hear more , and was grateful to her uncle for saying , There are very few people of whom so much can be said .	32.081951960608855
Whatever I do is done in a hurry , replied he ;	80.69831679698935
No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there .	39.075220114059526
When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose , or procuring any thing you had a fancy for ?	30.78445770557434
And what did she say ?	112.6638143817253
I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long .	19.466706362318693
Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact ;	54.89761124070059
Indeed I have , Sir , was her answer .	83.30516038881183
I was afraid they might not ;	94.80936332939592
Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure , but as his brother was eager in it , he meant to assist him in pursuing it .	28.95996167711739
But her commendation , though costing her some trouble , could by no means satisfy Collins , and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship's praise into his own hands .	23.854338098265202
it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister's being in town .	28.02473774359335
but the grounds are delightful .	82.82915650524242
There are few people in England , I suppose , who have more true enjoyment of music than myself , or a better natural taste .	30.459781967805007
cried Maria , after a few minutes silence , it seems but a day or two since we first came !	40.610980002414124
I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression .	31.1246850225569
Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great Lady's attention , which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others .	29.432716933610028
Sometimes she could fancy , that he talked less than on former occasions , and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her , he was trying to trace a resemblance .	20.6408924111374
As much as I ever wish to be , cried Elizabeth warmly , I have spent four days in the same house with him , and I think him very disagreeable .	27.68167583481621
Far be it from me , he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure , to resent the behaviour of your daughter .	28.72520815308165
Nothing could be more delightful !	137.47641128052
But if otherwise , if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been exchanged , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method , in her partiality for Wickham , and that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment .	16.754606189613146
My poor mother is really ill and keeps her room .	54.71416114366272
But of this answer Lydia heard not a word .	71.79562947934659
What a delightful library you have at Pemberley , Darcy !	61.51004372602071
Oh , sister !	214.29400702193354
Of music !	410.9500349080299
His attachment to Rosings , certainly increases .	58.60845783029751
It was very little less .	93.6009325011536
She would not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried home ;	38.6981096291345
And Lydia used to want to go to London , added Kitty .	39.74569039018329
I have a high respect for your nerves .	45.848332161802254
he certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible ;	60.96853593339997
it seems but a fortnight I declare ;	131.94330025101743
and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body .	28.983664778151518
He then handed her in , Maria followed , and the door was on the point of being closed , when he suddenly reminded them , with some consternation , that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings .	21.227147839543825
and as to Miss Bennet , he could not conceive an angel more beautiful .	28.300587128405773
As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Bingley , and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to , made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane .	23.01310325900142
and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence .	24.644284519324863
Its effect was most extraordinary ;	160.28287139486773
it was to remain the whole winter , and Meryton was the head quarters .	42.520618838509655
How strange !	304.1402219345311
CHAPTER IX .	223.11563766813362
Her hair so untidy , so blowsy !	57.32950755820727
Good bye .	294.4259161294515
And what is your success ?	114.64414181915072
His character was to speak for itself .	90.69590032414354
they were brightened by the exercise .	67.57583764029748
In the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more ;	42.79045487572912
Why should he have it more than anybody else ?	68.83650762350004

We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes , on purpose to pass for a lady , only think what fun !	30.413597966521795
Has he , has my nephew , made you an offer of marriage ?	64.16836911471968
cried Bennet , shaking her head , then she is better off than many girls .	47.68664412152945
Had his character been known , this could not have happened .	71.89854487097604
At that moment , she cared for no other .	67.88135753416842
where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making , and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself , some shelves in the closets up stairs .	16.63729217954443
Her Ladyship , with great condescension , arose to receive them ;	41.3480978561828
I am sure Lizzy will be very happy I am sure she can have no objection .	28.84795760494776
for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds .	42.80778535156478
Amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment ;	31.098373381174458
but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general , since Jane united with great strength of feeling , a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner , which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent .	20.61003601973824
how ardently did she long to know , whether any of his were directed in a like manner .	39.74099674007125

but angry people are not always wise ;	63.17532669555718

but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine .	29.827318716749474
And do you really know all this ?	95.54752644512367
If from no better motive , that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest , for dishonesty I must call it .	26.17674253331294
And yet , upon my honour , I believed what I said of myself to be true , and I believe it at this moment .	31.524223139530427
I did not think Gardiner was so little to be trusted .	40.70422472302504
His brother-in-law , Hurst , merely looked the gentleman ;	61.853256231701
It was hardly enough ;	89.28302500963764
and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did not err .	29.986689805038612
It was spoken of again while they were at dinner , when Collins joining in , observed , Yes , Miss Elizabeth , you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church , and I need not say you will be delighted with her .	15.672556550202428
if one could but go to Brighton !	115.92180655062305
It was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ;	23.242064337133574
Their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like man he is a great friend of Darcy's .	51.236368554321565
After sitting for a moment in silence , she said very stiffly to Elizabeth , I hope you are well , Miss Bennet .	31.30044047121918
But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Gardiner's letter , or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him .	20.392895667221048
You cannot refuse to dance , I am sure , when so much beauty is before you .	33.18701659193733
Well , how pleased I am !	87.2231144540506
But don't imagine it was from any silly cause .	45.18675553024881
I hope not so .	130.94978899774534
Your plan is a good one , replied Elizabeth , where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married ;	41.40136676319415
I often tell young ladies , that no excellence in music is to be acquired , without constant practice .	24.614621037823568
are sufficiently known .	270.554597543898
She saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow ;	37.572060796416295
To Elizabeth , however , he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed .	25.49649359013568
In that case he would return no more .	79.7344206276838
She dared not even mention that gentleman .	65.00411939671729
But , on second thoughts , perhaps Lizzy could tell us , what relations he has now living , better than any other person .	33.32666255507185
No one but Jane , she thought , could flatter herself with such an expectation .	50.59128294134141
The girls stared at their father .	74.81544815144728
The person of whom I speak , is a gentleman and a stranger .	56.687213639253365
Whatever my connections may be , said Elizabeth , if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to you .	34.93078070326223
He smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said .	34.62446791741678
CHAPTER XIV .	223.11563766813362
My mother would have had no objection , but my father hates London .	44.829100761186
[ Illustration : MATLOCK ] PRIDE AND PREJUDICE : A Novel .	15.436105785064006
Kitty then owned , with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us , that in Lydia's last letter , she had prepared her for such a step .	26.560275228879828
Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could ;	50.224036660836205
Little more than half a day's journey .	56.00866050524484
and so it does I vow .	82.12080388855188
and therefore it will not signify to anybody here , what he really is .	36.86159273777159
and by that means , as I told Lady Catherine myself one day , has deprived the British court of its brightest ornament .	22.82500380854851
Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane , on their first arrival at Lambton ;	33.82552447197709
You may imagine what I felt and how I acted .	68.19888683766206
It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner .	38.087253048954246
He deserves to be publicly disgraced .	47.06509634341655
Of having another daughter married to Collins , she thought with equal certainty , and with considerable , though not equal , pleasure .	37.75091560598649
and it was settled , that as soon as the ceremony was over , they should proceed to Longbourn .	31.822531440997775
Bennet was quite in the fidgets .	79.71639280587333
The first part of Gardiner's business on her arrival , was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions .	22.31035460175029

Bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say , but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , I shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as I did before .	22.51036484962841
It seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence , a most country town indifference to decorum .	25.904983682077514
The idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ;	21.092093591770706
I know my dear uncle and aunt so well , that I am not afraid of requesting it , though I have still something more to ask of the former .	23.542384078611548
would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe .	47.034107974842854
They look upon it quite as their own , I dare say , whenever that happens .	32.94054099443666
The subject was pursued no farther , and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away .	30.95800072892438
Reynolds informed them , that it had been taken in his father's life time .	43.57736143358584
Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets , of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won , and Collins , in describing the civility of and Philips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist , enumerating all the dishes at supper , and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House .	13.521319701965009
His principal object must be , to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham .	25.987574601504875
But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter , depended on the will of the parents .	22.194174154895016
or that may comfort you , under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parent's mind .	39.26231039217206
But I am particularly attached to these young men ;	38.03837371685926
He inquired how far Netherfield was from Meryton ;	55.44959454063224
Her father lifted up his eyes .	78.80748765381074
That you were gone into the army , and she was afraid had not turned out well .	36.09940663254652
Having said thus much , I feel no doubt of your secrecy .	57.86332276104736
Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look ;	46.87642766208219
that , that is the worst of all .	120.96947728739674
and that friendship between a person capable of it , and such an amiable man as Bingley , was incomprehensible .	27.593438869068134
and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley , in spite of that pollution which its woods had received , not merely from the presence of such a mistress , but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city .	18.205175367651393
Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished .	64.32193205479905
and very lively hopes of Bingley's heart were entertained .	49.47398063135159
He takes them now for people of fashion .	58.734669020779535
She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry ;	23.35342656448947
how can you be so teazing ?	130.1084606586723
and be ready to believe , for every body's sake , that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin .	30.92040841756113
in every view it is unaccountable !	117.05074768882464
Jane looked a little paler than usual , but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected .	36.53221935373347
said he , taking the letter from his pocket ;	69.75352101485781
La !	561.1845026368452
he hardly ever mentioned your name .	119.00301931644532
Nay , were your friend Lady Catherine to know me , I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation .	31.114787750433067
Wickham did not play at whist , and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia .	34.047382975238875
I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made her here ;	27.375246347610283
Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for common use ;	38.95410253490283
I am not a great reader , and I have pleasure in many things .	31.12332240300701
I cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen , in the whole range of my acquaintance , that are really accomplished .	21.834570654122604

Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was .	61.53580918809023
A long dispute followed this declaration ;	73.99408698510638
Undoubtedly , replied Darcy , to whom this remark was chiefly addressed , there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation .	21.07544559490175
My affections and wishes are unchanged , but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever .	34.039117107938715
What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ?	45.22717459240783
There was novelty in the scheme , and as , with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters , home could not be faultless , a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake .	20.885633483172068
She then spoke of the letter , repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham .	23.89285180517208
They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them .	32.957832154770635
They had often attempted it before , but it was a subject on which Bennet was beyond the reach of reason ;	32.40957023240192
It is nothing in comparison of Rosings , my lady , I dare say ;	30.252164467942226

Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters , would be unpardonable in me .	39.08885086379448
One morning , soon after their arrival , as she was sitting with her two elder sisters , she said to Elizabeth , Lizzy , I never gave you an account of my wedding , I believe .	24.897427292866595
This is your final resolve !	71.25881710341642
I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good .	45.83775039754654
It will not do .	134.160939998776
You either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other's confidence and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking ;	19.099244455470487
I quite forgot !	119.53010194250898
Charlotte herself was tolerably composed .	132.25293339132696
Elizabeth was surprised , but agreed to it immediately .	55.90864965802706
and hastily seizing a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt , if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended .	17.367935306926626
Colonel Forster will , I dare say , do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head .	29.19730547989186
You are safe from me .	77.26229562054525
Here , Sarah , come to Miss Bennet this moment , and help her on with her gown .	34.93017729370628
but from every window there were beauties to be seen .	45.82905549149841
This Younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with Wickham ;	46.25521636263106
You have insulted me , in every possible method .	49.564209012921566
from thence to the library ;	154.4448427016134
to be only just tolerable .	165.80752010251072
But papa is so disagreeable .	77.9685136541489
Why must she be scampering about the country , because her sister had a cold ?	50.83796190366673
I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday .	32.50382699108303
Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley .	34.54653703398735
The vicious propensities the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which Darcy could not have .	14.044626432964144
Jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention .	48.14724295047083
Darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish , and who probably never looked at you in his life !	36.93690537925898
The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield .	53.53696996173096
Oh !	298.0706733468098
talents which rightly used , might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters , even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife .	24.67002734501168
She turned from sister to sister , demanding their congratulations , and when at length they all sat down , looked eagerly round the room , took notice of some little alteration in it , and observed , with a laugh , that it was a great while since she had been there .	18.181310182387392
Wickham's happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer , and Collins's proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could .	27.627789545857222
A great deal of good management , depend upon it .	36.77447712248366
You have done all this !	115.40760367071593
The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life , and where they were now to spend a few days , was probably as great an object of her curiosity , as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock , Chatsworth , Dovedale , or the Peak .	16.67213985919225
but depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our surest way of disappointing him , will be to ask nothing about it .	20.056906310037174
It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment , from which she had been so wholly free at first .	27.9719895490486
Gardiner had seen Pemberley , and known the late Darcy by character perfectly well .	41.961439915928466
What could be the meaning of it ?	77.29871832911351
But to be candid without ostentation or design to take the good of every body's character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad belongs to you alone .	22.423584663912557
and her residence there will probably be of some duration .	45.3706450060332
But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice .	34.01281452717389
They are generally long ;	137.33706625520495
Exceed their income !	234.7417053933197
Find such a woman as soon as you can , bring her to Hunsford , and I will visit her .	37.82040873719244
Elizabeth jumped out ;	125.8672980850604
But these are not Jane's feelings ;	73.88500264116216
Elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her .	32.526055396678274
You think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly .	50.025845481833294
But you have chosen your fault well .	53.48955526087322
All loveliness and goodness as she is !	79.15638048218635
and , to my certain knowledge , more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner .	32.659639865434684
His air was grave and stately , and his manners were very formal .	38.38348294841767
As they drove to Gardiner's door , Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival ;	38.80997757908612
Oh !	298.0706733468098
But , she continued , recollecting herself , as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him .	24.544972370581633
My mother is tolerably well , I trust ;	74.57840149479888
At such a time , much might have been said , and silence was very awkward .	35.51409352320098
and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend , met her with every appearance of composure .	34.24232628732852
as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education , and who still resides with them .	31.427410895906014
But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend , where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment , should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire , without waiting to be argued into it ?	22.501153988108683
and every dish was commended , first by him , and then by Sir William , who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said , in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear .	19.533151056091953
he had lost every point ;	145.94851372026392
The housekeeper came forward , and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman , the son of her late master's steward , who had been brought up by him at his own expence .	20.946932501017276
She accounted for it , however , by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn , had by some accident been lost .	29.62893199846082
Sometimes .	806.2902343264145
for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all .	24.31082799667547
Their reception from Bennet , to whom they then turned , was not quite so cordial .	42.04529292421853
Why , I must confess , that I love him better than I do Bingley .	45.67780870173824
Aye , there she comes , continued Bennet , looking as unconcerned as may be , and caring no more for us than if we were at York , provided she can have her own way .	25.301133379821234
it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate .	34.696815202176865
He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names .	29.373380178970503
Elizabeth saw what he was doing , and at the first convenient pause , turned to him with an arch smile , and said , You mean to frighten me , Darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me ?	21.239747780398325
And when the party entered the assembly room , it consisted of only five altogether ;	36.62206558176713
It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy .	34.072364679543966
Yes but as it happens , they are all of them very clever .	66.2277038668771
When Collins could be forgotten , there was really a great air of comfort throughout , and by Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it , Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten .	25.19123609328413
Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ;	62.049773076468675
perhaps she meant well , but , under such a misfortune as this , one cannot see too little of one's neighbours .	39.815809887986184
It is evident that you belong to the first circles .	32.44057299396484
This was one point , with regard to Lydia at least , which was now to be settled , and Bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him .	27.023235558248327
and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room .	39.25142166037853
She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter , and , without knowing or considering what their income might be , rejected many as deficient in size and importance .	18.78862158430809
CHAPTER VI .	223.11563766813362
but I verily believe I could forgive him any thing and every thing , rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father .	22.396528041982172
Oh !	298.0706733468098
Her astonishment at his coming at his coming to Netherfield , to Longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire .	24.43043169941103
The promised letter of thanks from Collins arrived on Tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted .	19.19029927183571
Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of , cried Colonel Fitzwilliam .	51.96240533168533
I deserve neither such praise nor such censure , cried Elizabeth ;	34.303411125964516
She had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire Militia , in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man , who , on meeting him accidentally in town , had there renewed a slight acquaintance .	20.775222591612113
I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these .	41.11027226996521
No , said her father , Wickham's a fool , if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds .	20.592507754618573
and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane , nor half so good humoured as Lydia .	29.621470078275287
Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter ;	34.47076919086703
it jumps from admiration to love , from love to matrimony in a moment .	41.48697814459095
As soon as I get to town , I shall go to my brother , and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street , and then we may consult together as to what is to be done .	22.698982716098378
and then , on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured , he replied , Say nothing of that .	22.544988372468215
Certainly not .	371.69597583995085
Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home .	63.99971482518474
and that being the case , I cannot consider your situation with much compassion .	39.921142809345596
He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her .	38.18715905771073
the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy , received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before ;	32.00226473045348
As she had heard no carriage , she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine , and under that apprehension was putting away her half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions , when the door opened , and to her very great surprise , Darcy , and Darcy only , entered the room .	19.39456929867442
That tall , proud man .	95.55834630684953
In the hall they parted .	123.05763327927917
They were hopeless of remedy .	66.22916316560922
After an affectionate parting between the friends , Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Collins , and as they walked down the garden , he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family , not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter , and his compliments to and Gardiner , though unknown .	19.77416930858386
but , recovering herself , said in a lively tone , And pray , what is the usual price of an Earl's younger son ?	25.09313729579869
His most particular friend , you see by Jane's account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her .	36.717543707225765
She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue , and the mere stateliness of money and rank , she thought she could witness without trepidation .	16.428429388141115
You must not disappoint your father .	66.89662583120051
Good girl !	406.05039964354177
Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection , and said something of his concern , at having been prevented by business .	33.6830096099905
You may have drawn him in .	81.5516637746793
He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying ;	41.88458680458078
But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes .	26.98785817800861
If you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence .	34.18239551055058
E3 .	662.9770795749859
I , who have prided myself on my discernment !	45.69227523787769
I beg your pardon , replied Miss Bingley , turning away with a sneer .	26.254883352017583
I am sincerely grieved for him and F but no one can throw any blame on them .	27.215813820404104
But I pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it .	22.05019171186283
He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which it seems he has been told , by some of the good-natured , gossiping Lucases .	21.673574510838538
Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly , as well as her affection for Jane ;	38.289012899537525
I am glad he dines here on Tuesday .	41.725167097927596
Each felt for the other , and of course for themselves ;	63.440496431159154
She saw herself the object of attention , to tens and to scores of them at present unknown .	32.156984838222016
on the contrary , he was all attention to every body .	56.85436089107701
and , having nothing else to say , was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him .	32.90019927621727
but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts ;	39.08528378325998
I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge .	43.20756732160865
you do not know what I suffer .	94.09931151058363
I can now say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , I have seen nothing of it .	29.143607618252492
Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education .	44.62747436157086
shocking !	809.7253208263589
She is a great fool for going away , if she liked him .	32.08525216256584
I am so pleased so happy .	68.57249560576976
Oh !	298.0706733468098
but whatever she said , was spoken in so authoritative a tone , as marked her self-importance , and brought Wickham immediately to Elizabeth's mind ;	25.495781119348585
All was joy and kindness .	126.15632196903994
I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable .	26.14318069292089
and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning .	19.432370957308557
You tear them to pieces .	71.35811579870823
she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him .	32.73871978334261
but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's .	28.143911550435348
but his sisters gave it their hearty assent , and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations .	17.446821760371282
It will be no use to us , if twenty such should come since you will not visit them .	30.808040938814557
but when Philips began to express her concern thereupon , he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance , that he considered the money as a mere trifle , and begged she would not make herself uneasy .	20.512409570628027
She seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute , and never attended to Mary at all .	24.425657040002715
but with him I believe it does not often happen .	53.091597191090095
In spite of what her sister declared , and really believed to be her feelings , in the expectation of his arrival , Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it .	23.258757490115705
but they obligingly satisfied it , with the same kind of supposition , which had appeased Bennet's curiosity ;	24.189828270022435
The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value !	32.75317710031365
but their astonishment was beyond their expectation ;	76.12728343546564
Not Lydia only , but all were concerned in it ;	86.4636220854093
They are all for what they can get .	104.05665164921896
and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared .	32.18516026240394
Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony , marriage had always been her object ;	49.95152018626067
And of this place , thought she , I might have been mistress !	44.03515141193941
Well , Monday morning came , and I was in such a fuss !	33.0711739533085
and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again .	32.99698981444999
1 .	384.9991185797929
I confess , said he , that I should not have been at all surprised by her Ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings .	21.20799378561311
determined , if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive , and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female .	15.53172566638119
and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ;	29.436199343538554
In society so superior to what she had generally known , her improvement was great .	38.44378735358923
was fonder than ever of Georgiana , almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore , and paid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth .	28.955213991112092
gone to stay .	320.42598557733857
What will you think of my vanity ?	105.10071325072802
I thought I should have broke my heart .	48.32592555981349
Oh , Lizzy !	206.91653399511583
and therefore checked her laugh .	74.78954234113205
She had never perceived , while the regiment was in Hertfordshire , that Lydia had any partiality for him , but she was convinced that Lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body .	22.80459600352418
Oh , yes !	155.41443917661368
We must not make him desperate .	90.50702220718686
and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour , that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford , she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Darcy's having both spent three weeks at Rosings , and asked him if he were acquainted with the former .	19.791123465285267
His father , Miss Bennet , the late Darcy , was one of the best men that ever breathed , and the truest friend I ever had ;	24.66541009754213
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come .	14.251465112893985
It was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too , and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it .	26.446927547034647
They were off Saturday night about twelve , as is conjectured , but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight .	25.462570791059793
What is it you are talking of ?	90.2018712217227
We all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ;	42.094870627997544
His belief of her sister's insensibility , she instantly resolved to be false , and his account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice .	23.523441151557243
and pray when am I to wish you joy ?	65.25339281756591
But I cannot find out that Jane saw any thing of him in London .	41.08961852711478
I have no right to give my opinion , said Wickham , as to his being agreeable or otherwise .	32.265032888383146
Much as I abominate writing , I would not give up Collins's correspondence for any consideration .	36.4721215385576
exclaimed Elizabeth , you are too good .	106.95877026355872
But really , and upon my honour , I will try to do what I think to be wisest ;	29.341078742268238
Lydia , my love , ring the bell .	71.91393215535832
I beg your pardon ;	90.7205443614838
Is there nothing you could take , to give you present relief ?	70.13032264026693
She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution , which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments , which she could not otherwise have failed of ;	19.298801423600494
and in spite of her youth and her manners , she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her .	23.83546245050204
it told them , that on his arrival , he had immediately found out his brother , and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch street .	26.408209413167754
but I heard nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield .	44.40900568498848
but proud and conceited .	92.05756139874825
Now be sincere ;	242.55068714151164
He only told me , what I have now told you .	47.53318781909918
Oh , that I knew how it was !	65.68275416662293
The fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious attention .	30.460126303289687
and she sat down directly to the instrument .	43.91759305723778
A short pause followed this speech , and Hurst began again .	43.53336707020986
My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them .	33.07082119785266
To no creature had it been revealed , where secresy was possible , except to Elizabeth ;	43.61372012606507
Oh !	298.0706733468098
Elizabeth thanked him from her heart , and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying .	29.863862267332934
Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility ;	42.18947796817867
The t te- -t te surprised them .	25.674542902914176
But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire , she saw him from her dressing-room window , enter the paddock , and ride towards the house .	20.26009005257207
All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man , who , but three months before , had been almost an angel of light .	28.629679959911037
said Bennet , more than once , as if the credit of making it rain were all her own .	40.676740508625016
I am excessively attentive to all those things .	47.21452414839283
There was neither in figure nor face , any likeness between the ladies .	35.90181722150368
Bennet rang the bell , and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library .	35.245002511818775
They were excessively sorry to go !	77.29974416687074
Can this be Darcy !	221.18082946785947
I know how much you dislike him .	61.90835130637485
After watching her a little , Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful .	42.593374982064546
Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case , and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts .	19.2181719922035
You are not well enough ;	89.96569341929803
About the middle of the next day , as she was in her room getting ready for a walk , a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion ;	24.304698609498647
Darcy said nothing at all .	133.29901337573878
At that moment they were met from another walk , by Hurst and Elizabeth herself .	43.332631786584514
repeated Miss Bingley .	228.0057375080036
For the liveliness of your mind , I did .	64.24582183148254
and not a note , not a line , did I receive in the mean time .	44.61480373365281
Bennet , we shall have her at Netherfield at last .	74.05331359536811
But I knew not I was afraid of doing too much .	45.65961054434854
but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing , that instead of twelve , he had brought only six with him from London , his five sisters and a cousin .	25.43155332411217
CHAPTER XII .	234.75576465601785
They talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his fruit , of every thing but himself ;	37.33666873160719
Well , he certainly is very agreeable , and I give you leave to like him .	39.854782288326064
Their first subject was her sister ;	128.17504900405186
and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them , threw a real gloom over their domestic circle ;	19.15018780077389
She wrote cheerfully , seemed surrounded with comforts , and mentioned nothing which she could not praise .	23.058868279579155
Balls will be absolutely prohibited , unless you stand up with one of your sisters .	29.796331845963405
There can be no occasion for your going so soon .	67.0385488957788
I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure .	28.109289469476348
With many compliments to them , and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter , to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ;	21.869793822555167
It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs , under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants , and heedless of the future , must be very insufficient to their support ;	21.634525306811533
Would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part , that might offer consolation to such distress .	31.360707542417764
The dinner was exceedingly handsome , and there were all the servants , and all the articles of plate which Collins had promised ;	24.027616458806275
I rather wonder now at your knowing any .	60.558855400148715
and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement .	34.60503713507683
Mary and Kitty , thank Heaven !	78.99232521479333
She could only imagine however at last , that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible , according to his ideas of right , than in any other person present .	24.039159564532223
Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room .	35.581421306573375
The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again , called it an age since they had met , and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation .	23.568053594736252
You supposed more than really existed .	64.16804395310334
and , though little more than sixteen , her figure was formed , and her appearance womanly and graceful .	25.351256239455246
and when she wrote again , Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys .	28.557819195369646
In Lydia's imagination , a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness .	33.360945343178884
I was never more annoyed !	74.5875282209043
You have .	254.9803405480609
Indeed , replied Elizabeth , I am heartily sorry for him ;	38.85440363287068
The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion , and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone .	15.484933980994011
and as to my father , I never in my life saw him so affected .	42.4589103741979

and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled , she had all the success she expected .	27.822376295800197
That is a question which I hardly know how to answer .	36.98697989463445
Are the others coming out ?	170.29305673539045
I do not know .	78.70682147296458
That it ought not to be attempted .	76.18133178829008
But at length , by Elizabeth's persuasion , he was prevailed on to overlook the offence , and seek a reconciliation ;	24.358852731194318
We are not in a way to know what Bingley likes , said her mother resentfully , since we are not to visit .	36.26502288229941
It was the prospect of constant society , and good society , he added , which was my chief inducement to enter the shire .	24.78275480223305
single , my dear , to be sure !	85.50977742846213
You will have a charming mother-in-law , indeed , and of course she will be always at Pemberley with you .	36.15057675553041
Elizabeth was now to see Wickham for the last time .	62.81556657636151
but not handsome enough to tempt me ;	59.44281363124783
US laws alone swamp our small staff .	49.385551309361944
with less of splendor , and more real elegance , than the furniture of Rosings .	44.23555251756439
she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us , and offered her services , or any of her daughters , if they could be of use to us .	26.0701437817549
What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation ?	45.43129446153139
I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned .	21.980326924444594
Hear me in silence .	186.4486752357396
Neglect !	662.9770795749859
but , to counterbalance these advantages , Darcy had considerable patronage in the church , and his cousin could have none at all .	24.100730105207816
Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place ?	50.643333542723965
It makes me very nervous and poorly , to be thwarted so in my own family , and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else .	20.281291091455923
Darcy looked up .	257.1488285285829
She was teazed by Collins , who continued most perseveringly by her side , and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again , put it out of her power to dance with others .	17.185032739493337
At four o'clock , therefore , we may expect this peace-making gentleman , said Bennet , as he folded up the letter .	24.228624826514608
How should you have liked making sermons ?	79.9913142210449
What could he mean ?	169.8869395583164
I have told Miss Bennet several times , that she will never play really well , unless she practises more ;	27.181083143823393
he is a most interesting young man ;	85.97960225847925
Well , I was so frightened I did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ;	35.13070691214125
Our habits of expence make us too dependant , and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money .	29.732740496046127
And your defect is a propensity to hate every body .	36.358931789588155
We are not rich enough , or grand enough for them ;	47.429046603797815
Elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness , with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal .	29.302606498566586
They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds .	25.75121754864228
1 .	384.9991185797929
In a short time , I shall have a daughter married .	52.64318797547761
but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art ;	57.73833778743038
Charlotte the wife of Collins , was a most humiliating picture !	58.85939112894961
With my mother up stairs .	127.14435657113435
On this subject I have nothing more to say , no other apology to offer .	51.84844901078205
Though Darcy could never receive him at Pemberley , yet , for Elizabeth's sake , he assisted him farther in his profession .	37.1293849455843
I can much more easily believe Bingley's being imposed on , than that Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night ;	23.94385500628691
I cannot acquit him of that duty ;	66.75799961985773
Good Heaven !	268.16899036376185
Maria thought speaking out of the question , and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire .	36.50234966914389
Imprudent as a marriage between Wickham and our poor Lydia would be , we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place , for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland .	24.742735488120097
I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner .	29.291397813441474
They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation , and always spending more than they ought .	24.074189712560223
and no less certain is it , that I cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it .	31.773293775105625
He only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town , which you must acknowledge to be true .	24.79511875368125
Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth , which spoke her distress at such premeditation , and her intreaty that she would not give into it .	28.317134346923346
He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him ;	44.960274089397195
and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry .	31.729175822670985
Poor Lydia's situation must , at best , be bad enough ;	74.65503135032961
and therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , I will take it on myself .	28.957950303148472
The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed , by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking ;	25.07711711249268
It was not in their direct road , nor more than a mile or two out of it .	30.84692778253265
As for Mary , she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection , soon after they were seated at table , This is a most unfortunate affair ;	22.859977665964287
Well , said Charlotte , I wish Jane success with all my heart ;	45.340809391815675
that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars , and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer .	19.474983250025257
By you , I was properly humbled .	86.69646192833318
While settling this point , she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell , and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself , who had once before called late in the evening , and might now come to enquire particularly after her .	16.673886814289144
1 .	384.9991185797929
Oh !	298.0706733468098
Whatever can give his sister any pleasure , is sure to be done in a moment .	54.361854567830164
Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves ?	51.58786752594221
but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her , that she was only exceedingly shy .	30.00728466338451
And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last November , for had it been otherwise , I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace .	20.46639764401589
' Are any of your younger sisters out , Miss Bennet ?	52.46722525117403
Multiple superscripted characters are enclosed by curly brackets ( example : M rs ) .	15.677877487634852
she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not to believe it , and could not help saying so .	21.486474361307422
He should be particularly happy at any time , c .	42.755842166975576
The perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing , or on the evenness of his lines , or on the length of his letter , with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received , formed a curious dialogue , and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each .	16.21566981360266

If he wants our society , let him seek it .	48.20523939309971
As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their aunt , and all Collins's scruples of leaving and Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted , the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton ;	23.778894365783618

With respect to Wickham , the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation ;	29.257605242705633
It did .	238.60386091955033
He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her ;	44.6751792566516
CHAPTER XIII .	223.11563766813362
They battled it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved .	30.316036671325953
but really considering his descent , one could not expect much better .	44.85276959661713
After a short pause , her companion added , You are too generous to trifle with me .	31.008732060488462
They can only wish his happiness , and if he is attached to me , no other woman can secure it .	32.15325540797509
I admire the activity of your benevolence , observed Mary , but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason ;	21.841898069903152
I hope you saw her petticoat , six inches deep in mud , I am absolutely certain ;	19.53635868177337
They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time , and though I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions , I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible .	16.55572026455191
I thought I should have died .	59.54331094170258
and , before Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt , of which her daughter sat in momentary dread , Bingley , who wanted to be alone with Jane , proposed their all walking out .	25.3136037236546
It needed all Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity .	28.154372536560253
You alluded to something else .	73.09370895495029
He promises fairly , and I hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent .	28.59567477980877
and indeed , before we left Bakewell , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country .	31.0738878678563
and on these occasions , Gardiner , rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's warm commendation of him , narrowly observed them both .	18.950624156364754
Respect , esteem , and confidence , had vanished for ever ;	47.907077183272406
and he went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town .	35.2192463452931
Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly ;	83.37190970866355
Those to her mother , contained little else , than that they were just returned from the library , where such and such officers had attended them , and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild ;	23.406893701547293
but would my giving you the wished-for promise , make their marriage at all more probable ?	41.502881459953514
Nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the United States .	20.72694910946701
But I hope you will get over it , and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood .	23.92628024194437
The recollection of what I then said , of my conduct , my manners , my expressions during the whole of it , is now , and has been many months , inexpressibly painful to me .	24.063388432303963
Aye , no doubt ;	216.14219815359326
She said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence ;	37.131907511151816
We cannot suppose he would help it , if he could .	59.75881420543353
I am the happiest creature in the world .	40.0953262127541
and then you must stay all night .	66.43343700566125
How could he spare half ten thousand pounds ?	49.229103522384285
Perhaps by and bye I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones .	34.26880210759074
Though Elizabeth would not , for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine , have answered this question ;	38.00287227764474
What you ask , said Elizabeth , is no sacrifice on my side ;	55.232884954640845
She was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ;	47.47313064378509
I must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from declaring my amazement , at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married .	18.89599604552234
to the young ladies he certainly was nothing ;	115.12139223492933
Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort , much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements .	26.654137419075617
and how Lydia could ever have attached him , had appeared incomprehensible .	43.93445426016357
My uncle is to send a servant for us .	75.0876962494771
I see the imprudence of it .	63.331201214110536
Books Oh !	234.4342980591668
I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well and indeed so I do still at my heart ;	33.1894995097178
Scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning , but their visit to Rosings .	34.64055303837636
I was ready to die of laughter .	37.97183747000648
I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible .	33.16066627964783
CHAPTER XXII .	249.51422743723455
but consider how much it must increase his disappointment .	50.16067175691441
Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall ;	38.04277253146953
Elizabeth's courage did not fail her .	90.87935307963872
and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations .	25.796064335602917
is not there a little mistake ?	137.38276908754014
The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends ;	34.60647152616738
Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above-mentioned ;	40.42300151468682
We have not met since the 26th of November , when we were all dancing together at Netherfield .	30.255956840912177
Are you not diverted ?	132.0553924685458
The communication excited many professions of concern ;	52.638351614938394
He came to tell Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both , Wickham repeatedly , Lydia once .	31.607322210168753
each of them deep in thought .	125.94775278882845
You saw me dance at Meryton , I believe , Yes , indeed , and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight .	21.695894718391408
Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother , but remained quietly in the hall , till she and Kitty were out of sight , then returned into the drawing-room .	25.1280575447917
and as she walked up and down the room , endeavouring to compose herself , saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt , as made every thing worse .	19.231506712068406
With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family , and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton , sometimes dirty and sometimes cold , did January and February pass away .	17.306858880424127
Darcy smiled ;	341.15888943154073
but to speak with such civility , to enquire after her family !	54.85140542817943
and Sir William , to Elizabeth's high diversion , was stationed in the doorway , in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him , and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that way .	13.11496579165213
Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship .	30.22436616948866
A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued , on either side calm and concise and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister , just returned from their walk .	20.703766050443676
Could I expect it to be otherwise !	96.71323328843758
and soon laying it wholly aside , she drew near the card-table , and stationed herself between Bingley and his eldest sister , to observe the game .	18.843249867850712
To and Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself .	53.1576789021747
I do , I do like him , she replied , with tears in her eyes , I love him .	30.271617679167708
Yes , she will do for him very well .	74.4688486965701
and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again .	22.23529324950919
To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted , than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement .	32.383786253764804
But if we do not venture , somebody else will ;	40.19805034029452
The invitation was accepted of course , and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine's drawing-room .	35.51471960575021
It has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling .	40.565421999301456
and she read it again .	81.3556137871695
It is impossible that he should still love me .	47.39270880100407
but though he was now established only as a tenant , Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table , nor was Hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her .	20.03054567717937
The eldest of them , a sensible , intelligent young woman , about twenty-seven , was Elizabeth's intimate friend .	28.210998677383884
Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding , and made no answer .	30.757458929408447
Her carriage remained at the door , and Elizabeth saw that her waiting-woman was in it .	35.33476354410729
In this quiet way , the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away .	42.9755539502485
but at last on Bennet's leaving them together , after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master , she could not help saying , Oh !	21.786949640213432
I rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it would happen .	34.57213064837985
and it was settled that Jones should be sent for early in the morning , if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better .	20.78179668025569
Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's meditated elopement .	52.40068715522875
I knew you would be wishing me joy .	55.216785683249256
His letter was soon dispatched ;	117.9777926171442
do we ?	625.7455091521932
To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying .	58.669992463107725
We dine at Rosings twice every week , and are never allowed to walk home .	39.00804054105798
I do not know who is good enough for him .	40.50726395363023
But Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on , in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice .	24.47037866985259
Then , perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying , she added , Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson ;	20.65093561050661
These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship , and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay .	24.20915415350383
Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit .	70.21459392594521
and were informed that it was but just done , to give pleasure to Miss Darcy , who had taken a liking to the room , when last at Pemberley .	25.320230293643082
but why did not you tell me so before ?	52.45655332944044
To walk three miles , or four miles , or five miles , or whatever it is , above her ancles in dirt , and alone , quite alone !	27.074145617502886
But , my dearest Jane , you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday , or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend .	18.80381950732605
'Tis an etiquette I despise , said he .	57.063609067655186
This part of his intelligence , though unheard by Lydia , was caught by Elizabeth , and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make .	17.519280046475085
Well , my dear , said Bennet , when Elizabeth had read the note aloud , if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness , if she should die , it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Bingley , and under your orders .	17.982503978572147
At least , you should not remind your Mother of inviting him .	37.47797787353748
Allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not disgrace you , and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear Miss Eliza , ( glancing at her sister and Bingley , ) shall take place .	20.676095039293802
but as I have actually paid the visit , we cannot escape the acquaintance now .	45.33755554386444
She is not such a simpleton .	62.234025096244615
I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs , absurd and impertinent .	28.40094687315425
but he had something to direct his search , which was more than we had ;	36.87497496723561
There he had talked to her friends , when he could not to herself .	41.13313039264708
His circumstances , he assured me , and I had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad .	37.13519236041617
My father was not only fond of this young man's society , whose manners were always engaging ;	34.242081957220236
Oh !	298.0706733468098
for mine is totally different .	107.91671795815081
It was the second week in May , in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch-street , for the town of in Hertfordshire ;	28.75984418165358
If there were but such another man for you !	75.43958198594382
Pray make my excuses to Pratt , for not keeping my engagement , and dancing with him to-night .	30.52180092245752
If I have wounded your sister's feelings , it was unknowingly done ;	32.88320637715944
Bingley followed his advice .	151.97458372091967
and after all , Long and her nieces must stand their chance ;	46.85906260198892
She declared her resolution .	127.08258310073968
He made no answer .	99.97245400949103
and really , all things considered , I begin to think it perfectly reasonable .	38.779308911404016
Promise me , therefore , to come to Hunsford .	55.53929471390943
and so generous , that you will always exceed your income .	36.665818013833515
We must not all expect Jane's good fortune .	74.8229444375837
and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued , I remember , when we first knew her in Hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ;	25.44448039719823
I beg you will not go .	62.63971369191722
A report of a most alarming nature , reached me two days ago .	40.54211705188293
His affection was proved to have been sincere , and his conduct cleared of all blame , unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend .	23.03252713354872
No ;	670.778131953586
Yes , yes .	144.85133726722304
She is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else .	37.03661047940063
whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish .	23.37897458413332
and , in my opinion , exertion should always be in proportion to what is required .	33.54271666819945
Did you speak from your own observation , said she , when you told him that my sister loved him , or merely from my information last spring ?	32.37213546004033
The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation .	34.992609060348606
Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight , but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction .	27.468219551571465
Any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn , I suppose , would appear far .	46.88878156118523
I want to talk very seriously .	74.14708715505746
Who are your uncles and aunts ?	80.61368297467011
This was agreed to , and Philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets , and a little bit of hot supper afterwards .	17.8369024606556
A man of honour could not have doubted the intention , but Darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation , and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance , imprudence , in short any thing or nothing .	21.05058107071725
Where does discretion end , and avarice begin ?	47.164028107118476
and , allowing for the loss of Sir William , and there being only one card table in the evening , every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first .	20.31470088690463
When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over , he naturally returned to all his former indolence .	25.454218258111403
CHAPTER IX .	223.11563766813362
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her sister , and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case , was almost incredible !	24.172611228834832
He saw Wickham , and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia .	40.1429185500841
Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them .	54.61983194817941
You know I have .	143.25479727522082
It will then be publicly seen , that on both sides , we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance .	34.60905146847598
He wrote last week to hurry my return .	56.2639755872435
Jane then took it from her pocket-book , and gave it to Elizabeth .	55.98441087739482
There is but such a quantity of merit between them ;	36.7106132581995
As she spoke , she observed him looking at her earnestly , and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness , convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth .	20.169193414203843
Well , and so we breakfasted at ten as usual ;	46.296961616134126
Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her .	100.08915001543663
And this is your real opinion !	106.72741723433482
and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her , was still more strange .	31.927589897469428
She felt that she had no business at Pemberley , and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it .	22.35047058038538
but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it ;	43.89399791648493
and he soon afterwards said aloud , Bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day ?	25.067714877328267
Before Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise , Bennet instantly answered , Oh dear !	49.112207887437584
and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her , was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held .	24.57330527670164
And you saw him frequently ?	113.33511227061057
DEAR SIR , The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father , always gave me much uneasiness , and since I have had the misfortune to lose him , I have frequently wished to heal the breach ;	17.194350406237017
No , I should have turned in a moment .	53.046650924233724
Could he , or the Lucases , have pitched on any man , within the circle of our acquaintance , whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related ?	26.486087812207348
we talked and laughed so loud , that any body might have heard us ten miles off !	39.98376499255259
and , on the father's , from respectable , honourable , and ancient , though untitled families .	24.09762019993214
She was now , on being settled at home , at leisure to observe the real state of her sister's spirits .	32.06061177239741
so , it will be impossible for her to introduce him , for she will not know him herself .	45.93582771354028
What think you of this sentence , my dear Lizzy ?	65.0332596805473
Jane's is nothing to it nothing at all .	100.09289172175342
How could she deny that credit to his assertions , in one instance , which she had been obliged to give in the other ?	28.608207692415537
I dare say the lace upon Hurst's gown Here she was interrupted again .	18.88636463285214
and Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn , nothing remained to be done but to go ;	33.52454377935957
Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible .	70.78839084856219
and there is no occasion for talking to him , except just now and then .	38.83183544935133
I dearly love a laugh .	68.47308750286223
but without much success .	125.78708730748815
They saw him often , and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve .	39.81369901924523
said he , with a look of doubt .	89.74632425201791
Poor Eliza !	427.9598967801693
Speak to Lizzy about it yourself .	93.60049314407158
Not at all , was her answer ;	110.72960912001697
The same anxiety to get them by themselves , was visible again in the evening .	39.832290116197896
But he is an ugly fellow !	69.20659278576134
Yes , yes , they must marry .	84.91774770814999
Thursday was to be the wedding day , and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit ;	37.62648660674764
and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future ;	22.367149750308542
but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at .	46.34259944434241
Remember that she is one of a large family ;	75.06679093370207
They called at various times of the morning , sometimes separately , sometimes together , and now and then accompanied by their aunt .	26.843197321132877
Bingley , his two sisters , the husband of the eldest , and another young man .	40.850195164668854
Intimate as you are , you must know how it is to be done .	52.59109622264849
My father supported him at school , and afterwards at Cambridge ;	34.48622612172029
for when supper was over , singing was talked of , and she had the mortification of seeing Mary , after very little entreaty , preparing to oblige the company .	24.58185907644563
and their conversation , which had been passing while and Gardiner were engaged with their children , was now put an end to , by the approach of the whole party .	25.02106247901001
But Georgiana would not join her .	60.738582806305715
With respect to that other , more weighty accusation , of having injured Wickham , I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family .	25.49235585217845
Yet the misery , for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation , received soon afterwards material relief , from observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her former lover .	26.106799806585208
Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile .	68.76272510596553
It distressed her a little , and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage .	25.536708721537238
But I have other provocations .	62.49799544191248
He studies too much for words of four syllables .	38.55776370213466
From their infancy , they have been intended for each other .	53.00069663556674
he had all the best part of beauty , a fine countenance , a good figure , and very pleasing address .	36.007685280639
and she asked Bingley , whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present .	31.95487402379513
They followed her into the dining-parlour .	73.46464874822317
and after some contrivance , the whole party , with all their boxes , workbags , and parcels , and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's and Lydia's purchases , were seated in it .	18.85671342645594
On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls , whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room , and whose shyness , as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth , prevented their coming lower .	20.461139278249618
but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour .	37.94523882180253
and on his return , brought back , with great satisfaction , a message from her Ladyship , importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her .	21.397493283537315
I have no reason , I assure you , said he , to be dissatisfied with my reception .	27.421201428607645
In essentials , I believe , he is very much what he ever was .	46.747189412592604
Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday ;	76.60391744862648
and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there ;	31.78891719055482
and they soon became sensible , that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old , and whose own manners indicated respectability , was not to be hastily rejected .	19.6135138085978
Bromley , of course .	218.83520126342674
Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth , where confidence would give pleasure ;	50.91661774511194
What congratulations will then flow in !	91.36673245157209
My dear Bennet , said his lady to him one day , have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last ?	36.21023278576416
His countenance rather gained in austerity ;	72.48815436769173
The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family , connections , or fortune .	29.516647424501752
I do not know of any other designs that he had formed : but he was in such a hurry to be gone , and his spirits so greatly discomposed , that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this .	18.91404624346564
He has always something to say to every body .	58.20868273690234
but there were two or three much uglier in the shop ;	37.49038778275423
If he wishes to avoid seeing me , he must go .	57.21254413324403
Have you not heard me say , that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ?	34.51483473818025
and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before , was now high in her good graces .	26.242866574893466
she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ;	71.00392794025636
Bennet , you are wanted immediately ;	96.5846437728543
My real purpose was to see you , and to judge , if I could , whether I might ever hope to make you love me .	38.87308104857282
Oh !	298.0706733468098
He made a little mistake to be sure ;	73.98452039878329
This event had at last been despaired of , but it was then too late to be saving .	38.537089702802426
On this subject , what can you have to say ?	81.12149379068384
But will they make you happy ?	85.7627367083566
She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment ;	52.595136171763286
There could be no conversation in the noise of Philips's supper party , but his manners recommended him to every body .	30.718009302615922
An union of a different tendency , and precluding the possibility of the other , was soon to be formed in their family .	28.179074459045395
Yes ;	506.5076850786652
Elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ;	39.619924480429205
Did you see him while you were at Lambton ?	82.51779972565747
I do comprehend a great deal in it .	46.02736738844252
Did she call to refuse her consent ?	103.72312195470165
They must have seen them together for ever .	74.26953521314819
With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew ;	83.13904080549469
I am sure my sisters must all envy me .	38.135193840861135
I hope we may often meet again .	56.92915015399531
There was not much in the question , nor in the preceding remark , but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning .	30.38958225000372
She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of Darcy's sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , she turned up the lane , which led her farther from the turnpike road .	15.937208216134398
His sister was less delicate , and directed her eye towards Darcy with a very expressive smile .	33.87232086229542
Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend .	32.78112161771661
I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Bingley .	31.505194797957635
Bingley is most unaffectedly modest .	101.25579583535048
With a renewal of tenderness , however , they repaired to her room on leaving the dining-parlour , and sat with her till summoned to coffee .	23.709047031490226
Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment .	8.40616179201232
With a glance she saw , that he had lost none of his recent civility ;	33.19348327744815
Would Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it ?	26.336590362656622
But above all , above respect and esteem , there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked .	29.43076624401573
There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others .	27.68907295942263
And as I come back , I can call on Lady Lucas and Long .	43.10947716131024
She will be down in a moment I dare say .	43.406879678463305
There is nothing he would not do for her .	67.53426193173324
and for your own , let her be an active , useful sort of person , not brought up high , but able to make a small income go a good way .	25.560040377307427
Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed .	41.02731684809727
The dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last ;	35.989231273509866
At length , in a voice of forced calmness , he said , And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting !	25.4544205485721
she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld !	75.28780546624401
The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton ;	53.295661343676855
Very odd !	348.7474771342884
Her teeth are tolerable , but not out of the common way ;	42.27835369810188
They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in ;	51.919512700181635
but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable , they are not , I hope , quite so easily changed as that implies .	27.482843955917062
[ Illustration : DOVE-DALE ] PRIDE PREJUDICE .	28.3928871239746
Lady Catherine is a very respectable , sensible woman indeed , added Charlotte , and a most attentive neighbour .	29.414581442141174
and as for Hurst , by whom Elizabeth sat , he was an indolent man , who lived only to eat , drink , and play at cards , who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout , had nothing to say to her .	20.06308018540911
and when Bingley was gone , Jane constantly sought the same means of relief .	34.96102815480818
and the kind of half-expectation which Gardiner had formed , of their being followed by a letter from him , had ended in nothing .	26.90083052945175
She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter .	38.79209038922909
After wandering along the lane for two hours , giving way to every variety of thought ;	34.37877769529044
and such I might still have been but for you , dearest , loveliest Elizabeth !	40.65740054184538
Much had been done , and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday ;	35.542307701380615
And his behaviour , so strikingly altered , what could it mean ?	55.39290076488212
My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking .	49.06370245096183
It was gratitude .	109.77481812850503
One morning , about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been formed , as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining-room , their attention was suddenly drawn to the window , by the sound of a carriage ;	22.049381229456287
Certainly , he replied , biting his lips .	53.89955052750338
I honour your circumspection .	76.64739536045592
and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general , he can have no objection , I am sure , to oblige us for one half hour .	24.20240085012842
Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these .	75.98205944640232
He is gone to my father already .	79.60512125714702
When the ladies were separating for the toilette , he said to Elizabeth , Do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your apparel .	22.783451998320878
He bore it with noble indifference , and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy , had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Darcy , with an expression of half-laughing alarm .	19.784753340756748
and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery .	20.648110497824845
and Wickham had constant admission to the house .	46.0425591247614
and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly commendable , and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate , will be kindly overlooked on your side , and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch .	15.422842065828656
she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood , nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two , to visit his relations .	30.53530859365319
but she had not got beyond the words delightful , and charming , when some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her , might be mischievously construed .	17.978540706873858
Very well and this offer of marriage you have refused ?	65.8774714532742
My dear Hill , have you heard the good news ?	64.16322789374918
They crossed it by a simple bridge , in character with the general air of the scene ;	31.08088249807454
You appear to me , Darcy , to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection .	31.234822744192268
Well , and so just as the carriage came to the door , my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Stone .	27.817297703144142
In my opinion , the younger son of an Earl can know very little of either .	41.24634075473343
and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification .	27.88045622189476
Had you then persuaded yourself that I should ?	90.32373697421264
and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling .	24.051077434101202
that if he is so , you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me .	51.10592659459213
and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night , she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon .	24.905490815890307
I do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Darcy .	30.51368647825256
Had she merely dined with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ;	32.1983549267591
but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him .	30.257958218380047
dear Lizzy , only consider what he must have suffered .	64.98830172586868
I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure .	42.70475197749186
That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side , too , was another very welcome surprise ;	34.91241509440923
In spite of having been at James's , Sir William was so completely awed , by the grandeur surrounding him , that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow , and take his seat without saying a word ;	18.125496936543236
my dear , cried his wife , I cannot bear to hear that mentioned .	42.89167918800339
You can now have nothing farther to say , she resentfully answered .	43.940585549220096
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States .	12.448293083023867
How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year !	36.32982219660017
Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Philips , and she ventured , without any permission , to do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton .	32.76390611056229
Her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour : his judgment could not err , and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth , as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable .	18.715980338702774
and he found in Philips a very attentive listener , whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard , and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could .	21.227600714689572
When Lydia went away , she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and Kitty ;	38.7736548845648
It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom .	36.20903865710491
Their eyes instantly met , and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush .	28.60761919952697
Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed , as to leave her very little attention for her book ;	35.631384715401055
She was even sensible of some pleasure , though mixed with regret , on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Darcy and herself .	22.728685390895055
and she was more grieved than astonished to hear , in reply to her minute enquiries , that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits , there were periods of dejection .	23.87065084195229
And may I ask ?	178.5836491263356
In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure , said Bingley ;	38.20464615383257
and more than once during dinner did Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth , I am glad you are come back , Lizzy .	25.549296361485997
your father of course may spare you , if your mother can .	76.64961893958566
and of late it has been shifting about pretty much .	36.05473807231111
its solace was visiting and news .	87.58118543537012
Have you seen any pleasant men ?	84.62667096828515
But Bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own .	31.180289298310903
Elizabeth hesitated , but her knees trembled under her , and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them .	21.060722417487373
You have only proved by this , cried Elizabeth , that Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition .	33.12464102727951
but I believe we must abide by our original plan .	43.10523094215988
for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health , and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight .	19.103737226935248
That is all to be forgot .	91.29294425931936
and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Bennet's being quite unable to sit alone .	19.13909152318901
You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night .	35.7121083979852
Yes , I really believe Darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care .	29.423475710520975
She is up stairs , and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all .	41.41773165164119
With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added , How long did you say that he was at Rosings ?	35.415591482053046
People did say , you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas ;	43.47655477620447
She put down the letter , weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality deliberated on the probability of each statement but with little success .	17.600814945485023
Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing , after all .	58.914192818682096
But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side , said Jane .	33.90397759225191
Implacable resentment is a shade in a character .	54.68217062138226
FITZWILLIAM DARCY .	224.51675771562586
Your reproof , so well applied , I shall never forget : 'had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner .	29.860984624481777
at first .	575.4153940444811
The letter shall certainly be burnt , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard ;	26.005654992168143
And there is something of dignity in his countenance , that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart .	29.649619005419165
Oh !	298.0706733468098
Her father , contented with laughing at them , would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters ;	22.88609055122282
Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow , and sat down again to her work , with an eagerness which it did not often command .	28.63738950131064
and , alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother , we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London .	22.26735108303021
to the last .	366.2317526476179
Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt , and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description , when Hurst called them to order , with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward .	18.988601685617475
Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea , and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies .	25.84660181543191
And you only the second .	155.6691225910466
Philips was always glad to see her nieces , and the two eldest , from their recent absence , were particularly welcome , and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home , which , as their own carriage had not fetched them , she should have known nothing about , if she had not happened to see Jones's shop boy in the street , who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away , when her civility was claimed towards Collins by Jane's introduction of him .	18.480901088773876
What a letter is this , to be written at such a moment .	50.99377788109286
for though the chief of his concerns , with the son of his patron , were imperfectly understood , it was yet a well known fact that , on his quitting Derbyshire , he had left many debts behind him , which Darcy afterwards discharged .	20.53290231612933
There are few people whom I really love , and still fewer of whom I think well .	35.44504882590939
His debts to be discharged , and something still to remain !	44.41558976306714
and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino , the two girls had the honour of assisting Jenkinson to make up her party .	20.834564855541057
It soothed , but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self-attracted by the rest of her family ;	20.853043165846568
But your family owe me nothing .	79.36655540006875
Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad ?	39.77109400845529
Oh !	298.0706733468098

Even Elizabeth began to fear not that Bingley was indifferent but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away .	34.14664070702907
The satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her husband , might then have rested in its proper place .	18.786712741818675
and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs , to think of any thing else .	19.864692268585564
but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line .	26.778339545906512
I believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as I do .	31.8250310052543
The party seemed so well selected , so suitable one with the other .	42.83891624924923
But when they see , as I trust they will , that their brother is happy with me , they will learn to be contented , and we shall be on good terms again ;	28.71275406693033
Do let us have a little music , cried Miss Bingley , tired of a conversation in which she had no share .	29.80391245501245
She answered in the affirmative , and , unable to resist the temptation , added , When you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance .	21.299307379890323
It was not known that Wickham had a single relation , with whom he kept up any connection , and it was certain that he had no near one living .	24.43796580737444
and Elizabeth , after all the misery of the morning , found herself , in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed , seated in the carriage , and on the road to Longbourn .	19.632705946266775
It is every way horrible !	65.0382878730204
cried Miss Bingley , Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable .	30.63540276338613
and the other , that she herself had been barbarously used by them all ;	32.03501926317142
The usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter .	46.71903966430601
It is unaccountable !	88.64375584630719
Bennet made no answer , and each of them , deep in thought , continued silent till they reached the house .	26.97662429961673
The others have been gone on to Scarborough , these three weeks .	39.97882429767424
I am not likely to leave Kent for some time .	37.588106054569174
I am thinking of what you have been telling me , said she .	29.211629907214746
he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen !	68.9102204017751
I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals , but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them .	21.217672010620976
About a month , said Elizabeth ;	103.4378057832438
She could think of nothing more to say ;	75.40592643667128
I am very glad you liked her .	53.570620394519665
He called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil , which had been brought on by himself .	21.48509444976064
You are all kindness , Madam ;	89.43470449250735
She will follow wherever Lydia leads .	59.78678255651248
What a contrast between him and his friend !	74.35824519355569
Ah !	531.6294007955007
indeed you have no reason .	179.15126585145532
In her own past behaviour , there was a constant source of vexation and regret ;	32.64069436476431
If I may so express it , he has a right to be proud .	46.42948227239933
Only think of its being three months , she cried , since I went away ;	40.72436668773453
if the first , I should be completely in your way ;	71.56172740747137
He was as generous , she doubted not , as the most generous of his sex .	41.07518182242083
And this , cried Darcy , as he walked with quick steps across the room , is your opinion of me !	34.72643090114365
If I , said Collins , were so fortunate as to be able to sing , I should have great pleasure , I am sure , in obliging the company with an air ;	21.61932682913565
and Lydia , in a voice rather louder than any other person's , was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her .	23.18564683877167
She seems perfectly happy , however , and in a prudential light , it is certainly a very good match for her .	22.750929533411053
E1 .	678.768366515382
Invented by M rs Bell 26 Charlotte Street Bedford Square .	18.44673906090338
and had some new extracts to admire , and some new observations of thread-bare morality to listen to .	23.266620906556522
True , said Bennet , but it is a comfort to think that , whatever of that kind may befal you , you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it .	30.862176157294055
certainly , said Elizabeth , though burning with curiosity ;	64.31602179313587
or , with a mind so occupied , she might have forgotten where she was .	45.5049677859545
Oh !	298.0706733468098
Regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure , but I wrote to Wickham , who left the place immediately , and Younge was of course removed from her charge .	24.780301657071924
I know it cannot be long .	73.06089779428338
My beauty you had early withstood , and as for my manners my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not .	24.410483082203704
But there was still something lurking behind , of which prudence forbad the disclosure .	26.79214900244112
These were the contents : MY DEAR HARRIET , You will laugh when you know where I am gone , and I cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning , as soon as I am missed .	20.35739755724429
and every body began to find out , that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness .	22.852856993385807
But I ought to beg his pardon , for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant .	30.947536545115874
With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted !	58.20465905486089
She had high animal spirits , and a sort of natural self-consequence , which the attentions of the officers , to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her , had increased into assurance .	19.080377517952922
but unable to contain herself , began scolding one of her daughters .	30.288852164298316
Heaven forbid !	273.3801452113293
and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again .	33.68044772918377
Colonel Forster came yesterday , having left Brighton the day before , not many hours after the express .	40.80214796507935
Not a word , however , passed his lips in allusion to it , till their visitor took his leave for the night ;	29.509161581508398
It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Darcy than they had before any idea of ;	30.634563902813802
I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude .	28.037088658250187
but now , as soon as they were alone together , she said , I saw you look at me to-day , Lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present report ;	24.682146361368734
Lydia was Lydia still ;	199.39490018930766
I should have considered it as part of my duty , and the exertion would soon have been nothing .	27.57323549204104
I was very uncomfortable , I may say unhappy .	54.55536969373187
And your assurance of it , I suppose , carried immediate conviction to him .	33.262155443103566
and Mary , at the end of a long concerto , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs , at the request of her younger sisters , who with some of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room .	16.34681329572238
though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them .	29.243471883102398
To work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures ;	49.81573765487844
He could even listen to Sir William Lucas , when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country , and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at James's , with very decent composure .	17.28088657754965
and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own .	24.17968820924681
and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and at first was resolved not to break it ;	27.333906489576407
Her mind was less difficult to develope .	59.19606208706011
Oh !	298.0706733468098
that of Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest ;	129.36728657200237
Instead of viewing them as a stranger , I might have rejoiced in them as my own , and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt .	28.3776156854339
and as Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her's , it was performed in a proper manner , without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary .	23.312426278193897
was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room , and from all the others when they sat down to table .	25.997330709820353
his sisters declared that they were miserable .	95.26413976275155
It had not been very great ;	109.16542094964042
You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary , compressed , marked up , nonproprietary or proprietary form , including any word processing or hypertext form .	14.793820015245513
And so , my dear sister , I find from our uncle and aunt , that you have actually seen Pemberley .	28.534299012877813
The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week ;	36.22856529843375
I do , indeed , replied Elizabeth , colouring .	37.693295910062346
A person may be proud without being vain .	65.19289240143912
For the truth of every thing here related , I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam , who from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the executors of my father's will , has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions .	17.806684858477503
I shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his constancy .	34.979593644244
I should never have said Collins was settled near her family .	52.84205539536892
Wretched , wretched , mistake !	105.55613399644035
Those who do not complain are never pitied .	55.37190750523515
Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete , old , middle-aged and new computers .	9.541818463405487
How differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned !	44.84226402024472
Elizabeth , you are not serious now .	65.78227380645825
All this was acknowledged to Gardiner ;	131.40391991747862
What a fine thing for our girls !	104.05884466891322
You did !	281.5848006591292
No man of common humanity , no man who had any value for his character , could be capable of it .	31.473667895848273
but at length was reduced to be reasonable .	51.50981730829267
It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Bingley to see you all after him so soon ;	48.26882154155563
An excellent consolation in its way , said Elizabeth , but it will not do for us .	42.13205142533015
Nothing had ever suggested it before , but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter , than by supposing a partiality for their niece .	29.723472269066065
But , he added , you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them , with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here .	25.66243305198543
Is there one among the sex , who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman ?	28.447595389182045
At length , she spoke again .	79.89714380335815
and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement .	51.59680937105151
See <URL> Transcriber's note : Text enclosed by underscores is in italics ( italics ) .	18.497228968679025
I have just as much right to be asked as she has , and more too , for I am two years older .	28.608982061122553
he shook his head when I expressed my hopes , and said he feared W was not a man to be trusted .	31.746084820410697
My dear Lizzy , where can you have been walking to ?	41.647469804528505
After a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner , and thus began , In vain have I struggled .	28.771444076116158
But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault because I would not take the trouble of practising .	25.245191994482
and , of course , I could not rest till I knew the particulars .	48.97108350637815
That lady I suppose is your mother .	110.79259878778235
and on their being seated , a pause , awkward as such pauses must always be , succeeded for a few moments .	32.335048078400646
From the former .	224.0617273024449
There was one part especially , the opening of it , which I should dread your having the power of reading again .	27.481447921743793
They came .	305.7870686303376
and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed .	23.488395595925375
Wickham is safe .	284.5649816358536
and Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem .	32.935993407186835
Many stared .	352.84716852947975
