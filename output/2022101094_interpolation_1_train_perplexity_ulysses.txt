The professor , returning by way of the files , swept his hand across Stephen’s and Mr O’Madden Burke’s loose ties .	52779.073802375766
His feet marched in sudden proud rhythm over the sand furrows , along by the boulders of the south wall .	53877.299708997816

Loyal to a lost cause .	148668.86573605234
A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes ( because it was expected in the Lady’s Pictorial that electric blue would be worn ) with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket ( in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit ) and a navy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure to perfection .	38280.691271424694

What she ?	454062.5205477112
Inshore and farther out the mirror of water whitened , spurned by lightshod hurrying feet .	61931.23375388448
The heavy noonreek tickled the top of Mr Bloom’s gullet .	79952.77985687694
She thinks .	454062.5205477112
Tommy on the clay here !	148668.86573605234
A blind stripling stood tapping the curbstone with his slender cane .	74786.41560936115
And Bass’s mare ?	269669.00293591485
The reflection that , apart from the letter in question , his magnetic face , form and address had been favourably received during the course of the preceding day by a wife ( Mrs Josephine Breen , born Josie Powell ) , a nurse , Miss Callan ( Christian name unknown ) , a maid , Gertrude ( Gerty , family name unknown ) .	39288.334920513036
Greetings from the famous son of a famous father .	86520.5193422713
Tarbarrels and bonfires were lighted along the coastline of the four seas on the summits of the Hill of Howth , Three Rock Mountain , Sugarloaf , Bray Head , the mountains of Mourne , the Galtees , the Ox and Donegal and Sperrin peaks , the Nagles and the Bograghs , the Connemara hills , the reeks of M’Gillicuddy , Slieve Aughty , Slieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom .	38853.904890054255
She fixes her bluecircled hollow eyesockets on Stephen and opens her toothless mouth uttering a silent word .	58061.315025007716
No , Stephen said .	190534.93313985676
In loose allwool garments with Harris tweed cap , price <TIME> , and useful garden boots with elastic gussets and wateringcan , planting aligned young firtrees , syringing , pruning , staking , sowing hayseed , trundling a weedladen wheelbarrow without excessive fatigue at sunset amid the scent of newmown hay , ameliorating the soil , multiplying wisdom , achieving longevity .	39584.84181390581
This is the most historic spot in all Dublin .	86520.5193422713
Like old times .	269669.00293591485
Lovely .	1082073.3456515577
He thrust back quick Agendath .	148668.86573605234
I’m coming , Stephen said , turning .	106794.09737961944
Pretend to want something awfully , then cry off for her sake .	70624.6447456167
Waterloo .	1082073.3456515577
MICHAEL , ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH : ( Pours a cruse of hairoil over Bloom’s head ) Gaudium magnum annuntio vobis .	53877.299708997816
He’s a bloody ruffian , I say , to take away poor little Willy Dignam .	61931.23375388448
He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace’s private asylum for demented gentlemen .	70624.6447456167
Prescott’s dyeworks van over there .	148668.86573605234
Good idea if you’re stuck .	148668.86573605234
Take the train there tomorrow .	148668.86573605234
Silver threads among the grey .	148668.86573605234
Good God he never heard in all his life a note like that he never did then false one we had better part so clear so God he never heard since love lives not a clinking voice lives not ask Lambert he can tell you too .	41684.80607579109
And Richie Goulding drank his Power and Leopold Bloom his cider drank , Lidwell his Guinness , second gentleman said they would partake of two more tankards if she did not mind .	45582.81356435569
Before born bliss babe had .	148668.86573605234
Blot over the other so he can’t read .	95117.79564571494
( He swoops uncertainly through the air , wheeling , uttering cries of heartening , on strong ponderous buzzard wings ) Ho , boy !	50090.76006305003
That strained look on her face !	123425.2711740012
You were not born to be a teacher , I think .	74786.41560936115
Then from the starving cagework city a horde of jerkined dwarfs , my people , with flayers’ knives , running , scaling , hacking in green blubbery whalemeat .	47484.17993176571
A fair unsullied soul had called to him and , wretch that he was , how had he answered ?	55106.355849378175
Then hastened .	454062.5205477112
One thinks of Homer .	190534.93313985676
The reverend Hugh C Love , Rathcoffey .	106794.09737961944
Tritonville road .	454062.5205477112
Sandy shrivelled smell he seems to have .	106794.09737961944
O , and will you ever forget her the evening she dressed up in her father’s suit and hat and the burned cork moustache and walked down Tritonville road , smoking a cigarette .	45185.388973043715
But that has been explained , I believe , by jurists .	74786.41560936115
Twenty years of it , regret them not .	95117.79564571494
He ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters .	123425.2711740012
Rome boose for the Bloom toff .	123425.2711740012
The word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire .	79952.77985687694
Not the jealous lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed adultery fully , eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris , with her husband’s brother ?	47484.17993176571
My country above the king .	148668.86573605234
Go and lose more .	190534.93313985676
She took a folded postcard from her handbag .	95117.79564571494
He stopped , sniffed , stalked round it , brother , nosing closer , went round it , sniffling rapidly like a dog all over the dead dog’s bedraggled fell .	46464.40882298539
He turned to J J O’Molloy and asked : Well , Jack .	70624.6447456167
O , and I forgot that latchkey too .	95117.79564571494
Such an appeal will touch him .	123425.2711740012
Italian ?	1082073.3456515577
On the slow weedy waterway he had floated on his raft coastward over Ireland drawn by a haulage rope past beds of reeds , over slime , mudchoked bottles , carrion dogs .	45582.81356435569
No .	1082073.3456515577
There he is : royal Dublin fusiliers .	106794.09737961944
Imagine trying to eat tripe and cowheel .	106794.09737961944
Of lost leaders , the betrayed , wild escapes .	86520.5193422713
Lotus ladies tend them i’the eyes , their pineal glands aglow .	74786.41560936115
Unless you’re in the know .	148668.86573605234
The gules doublet and merry saint George for me !	86520.5193422713
But being brought back to life no .	106794.09737961944
His tongue clacked in compassion .	148668.86573605234
The crooked skirt swinging , whack by whack by whack .	79952.77985687694
But , gramercy , what of those Godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibilise , which is the sin against the Holy Ghost , Very God , Lord and Giver of Life ?	46008.144883052715
( He throws a leg astride and , pressing with horseman’s knees , calls in a hard voice ) Gee up !	52779.073802375766
The harp that once or twice .	123425.2711740012
Three days !	454062.5205477112
Something new and easy .	190534.93313985676
Done to a turn .	190534.93313985676
He does look balmy .	190534.93313985676
And on our virgin sward .	148668.86573605234
Come on .	454062.5205477112
Stephen said .	454062.5205477112
And left the femme de trente ans .	106794.09737961944
Flimsy China silks .	269669.00293591485
All the beef to the heels were in .	95117.79564571494
What involuntary actions followed ?	190534.93313985676
Dreck !	1082073.3456515577
Your God was a jew .	148668.86573605234
Better add postscript .	269669.00293591485
They have no mercy on that here or infanticide .	86520.5193422713
That’s the maxim of the law .	123425.2711740012
If the second advent came to Coney Island are we ready ?	74786.41560936115
Know where that is ?	190534.93313985676
Call it , let me see .	123425.2711740012
And his old fellow before him perpetrating frauds , old Methusalem Bloom , the robbing bagman , that poisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping the country with his baubles and his penny diamonds .	44135.6671988653
No other in sight .	190534.93313985676
The Croppy Boy .	269669.00293591485
He could not leave his mother an orphan .	95117.79564571494
They say we are to have a literary surprise , the quaker librarian said , friendly and earnest .	56490.72529109286
That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it ?	123425.2711740012
Talking about violent exercise , says Alf , were you at that Keogh-Bennett match ?	64349.96385304137
She longed to go .	190534.93313985676
( He pants cringing ) I love the danger .	86520.5193422713
Tantalising for the poor dead .	148668.86573605234
Look in here .	269669.00293591485
The pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young May morning .	46464.40882298539
Rawthere !	1082073.3456515577
Absinthe the lot .	269669.00293591485
Thr BLOOM : ( Docile , gurgles ) I rererepugnosed in rerererepugnant BELLO : ( Imperiously ) O , get out , you skunk !	50090.76006305003
O’MADDEN BURKE : Free fox in a free henroost .	86520.5193422713
Cartoons .	1082073.3456515577
a voice asked .	269669.00293591485
ZOE : ( Runs to stephen and links him ) O go on !	67205.5840176548
My father’s a bird , he lapped the sweet lait chaud with pink young tongue , plump bunny’s face .	55106.355849378175
No use thinking of it any more .	106794.09737961944
To think of him house and homeless , rooked by some landlady worse than any stepmother , was really too bad at his age .	50090.76006305003
And he had experience of the like brood beasts and of springers , greasy hoggets and wether wool , having been some years before actuary for Mr Joseph Cuffe , a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by Mr Gavin Low’s yard in Prussia street .	40691.30754007079
He unbuttoned successively in reversed direction waistcoat , trousers , shirt and vest along the medial line of irregular incrispated black hairs extending in triangular convergence from the pelvic basin over the circumference of the abdomen and umbilicular fossicle along the medial line of nodes to the intersection of the sixth pectoral vertebrae , thence produced both ways at right angles and terminating in circles described about two equidistant points , right and left , on the summits of the mammary prominences .	37981.29921729178
These timely reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind somewhat distracted from Stephen’s words while the ship of the street was man uvring and Stephen went on about the highly interesting old .	44464.00094678129
Hat , tie , overcoat , nose .	106794.09737961944
No .	1082073.3456515577
No such ass .	269669.00293591485
BLOOM : Science .	269669.00293591485
Zoe and Kitty still point right .	123425.2711740012
They believe in rod , the scourger almighty , creator of hell upon earth , and in Jacky Tar , the son of a gun , who was conceived of unholy boast , born of the fighting navy , suffered under rump and dozen , was scarified , flayed and curried , yelled like bloody hell , the third day he arose again from the bed , steered into haven , sitteth on his beamend till further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid .	37573.7753600514
No-one behind .	454062.5205477112
Gone but not forgotten .	190534.93313985676
He looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen , image of his mother , which was not quite the same as the usual handsome blackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after as he was perhaps not that way built .	41877.79964778301
Yes , it is .	190534.93313985676
They can’t manage men’s intervals .	148668.86573605234
The stick fell in silted sand , stuck .	95117.79564571494
At least it’s not settled yet .	123425.2711740012
Ireland .	1082073.3456515577
Will you ever forget his goggle eye ?	106794.09737961944
It is for you , Gertrude MacDowell , and you know it .	70624.6447456167
A married man !	269669.00293591485
Good morning , sir .	190534.93313985676
The widewinged nostrils , from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected , were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest .	46008.144883052715
Why the cannibals cotton to it .	123425.2711740012
Sir Bob , I said MRS YELVERTON BARRY : ( In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength ivory gloves , wearing a sabletrimmed brickquilted dolman , a comb of brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair ) Arrest him , constable .	42750.498952976304
All trotting down with porringers and tommycans to be filled .	79952.77985687694
Time has branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite possibilities they have ousted .	55106.355849378175
Resigned he passed out with grave words and gait , saying , wellnigh with sorrow : And going forth he met Butterly .	51792.04344489804
Suppose she does ?	269669.00293591485
Very well then , I contradict myself .	106794.09737961944
It’s she !	454062.5205477112
Fat of death , Simon , Ben Dollard growled .	86520.5193422713
In a dream , silently , she had come to him , her wasted body within its loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood , her breath , bent over him with mute secret words , a faint odour of wetted ashes .	41877.79964778301
Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip .	95117.79564571494
Pier with lamps , summer evening , band .	95117.79564571494
His sleep is not natural .	148668.86573605234
He looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished .	74786.41560936115
He was too young to understand .	123425.2711740012
From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees were covered , as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible , with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse ( Ulex Europeus ) .	41324.382714844294
Look out .	454062.5205477112
Did you see that bloody chimneysweep near shove my eye out with his brush ?	64349.96385304137
And Father Cowley laughed again .	148668.86573605234
An azured harebell like her veins .	123425.2711740012
The art of being a grandfather , Mr Best gan murmur .	74786.41560936115
Kind of a general all round over me and half down my back .	67205.5840176548
L’homme qui rit !	269669.00293591485
And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians , says Joe , haven’t we had enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George the elector down to the German lad and the flatulent old bitch that’s dead ?	43258.87979258723
A E has been telling some yankee interviewer .	95117.79564571494
Yes .	1082073.3456515577
How are you at all ?	148668.86573605234
Longfelt want .	454062.5205477112
It’s always flowing in a stream , never the same , which in the stream of life we trace .	55106.355849378175
Resp .	1082073.3456515577
Where’s that bleeding awfur ?	190534.93313985676
People could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what properly riled them was a bite from a sheep .	52779.073802375766
VIRAG : We can do you all brands , mild , medium and strong .	64349.96385304137
But a man who holds so tightly to what he calls his rights over what he calls his debts will hold tightly also to what he calls his rights over her whom he calls his wife .	44135.6671988653
( He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset siding The glow leaps again .	56490.72529109286
It must have fell down , she said .	95117.79564571494
Her son was the substance .	148668.86573605234
Night he ran round to us to borrow a dress suit for that concert .	64349.96385304137
Of the offence to me , Stephen answered .	95117.79564571494
Our mighty mother !	269669.00293591485
Go thou and do likewise .	148668.86573605234
But they can go hang , says he with a wink , for me with their bully beef , a pox on it .	50900.28634166711
You and I are the fat in the fire .	86520.5193422713
What points of contact existed between these languages and between the peoples who spoke them ?	61931.23375388448
Dosing it with Edwards’ desiccated soup .	123425.2711740012
Hark !	1082073.3456515577
Easier to enlist and drill .	148668.86573605234
Then someone said something about the case of the <ABBREVATION>Lady Cairns of Swansea run into by the Mona which was on an opposite tack in rather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck .	44464.00094678129
On .	1082073.3456515577
Three days imagine groaning on a bed with a vinegared handkerchief round her forehead , her belly swollen out .	55106.355849378175
( He hesitates amid scents , music , temptations She leads him towards the steps , drawing him by the odour of her armpits , the vice of her painted eyes , the rustle of her slip in whose sinuous folds lurks the lion reek of all the male brutes that have possessed her .	40411.824888055715
Corns on his kismet however .	148668.86573605234
Live by their wits .	190534.93313985676
Pwee !	1082073.3456515577
( Through silversilent summer air the dummy of Bloom , rolled in a mummy , rolls roteatingly from the Lion’s Head cliff into the purple waiting waters ) THE DUMMYMUMMY : Bbbbblllllblblblblobschbg !	45582.81356435569
Figures wander , lurk , peer from warrens .	95117.79564571494
Walk on roseleaves .	269669.00293591485
E1 through 1 .	269669.00293591485
BLOOM : ( Over Stephen’s shoulder ) Yes , go .	79952.77985687694
There’s something up .	269669.00293591485
There’s a priest .	269669.00293591485
God’s truth , says Alf .	148668.86573605234
Other steps into his shoes when he gets his notice to quit .	70624.6447456167
Here .	1082073.3456515577
I dreamt of a watermelon .	148668.86573605234
Just keeping alive , M’Coy said .	123425.2711740012
Sir Leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what cry that it was whether of child or woman and I marvel , said he , that it be not come or now .	44135.6671988653
At the lacefringe of the tide he halted with stiff forehoofs , seawardpointed ears .	64349.96385304137
I fell foul of him one evening , I remember , at bowls .	67205.5840176548
The shreds fluttered away , sank in the dank air : a white flutter , then all sank .	56490.72529109286
The bag of Goulding , Collis , Ward led Bloom by ryebloom flowered tables .	64349.96385304137
By the way no harm .	148668.86573605234
Fair day and all the beef to the heels were in .	74786.41560936115
A scheme for the repristination of passenger and goods traffics over Irish waterways , when freed from weedbeds .	56490.72529109286
And in a ladychapel another taking housel all to his own cheek .	70624.6447456167
Occupy her .	454062.5205477112
Stephen sketched a brief gesture .	148668.86573605234
BLOOM : No , no , no .	106794.09737961944
We had to .	269669.00293591485
If they don’t see .	190534.93313985676
Fontenoy , eh ?	269669.00293591485
Valuing himself not a little upon his elegance , being indeed a proper man of person , this talkative now applied himself to his dress with animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had advanced .	41155.85169866419
His head disappeared and reappeared .	148668.86573605234
Fits me down to the ground .	123425.2711740012
Sanktus !	1082073.3456515577
Lionel , thou lost one !	148668.86573605234
On earth as it is in heaven .	106794.09737961944
You don’t grasp my point , says Bloom .	95117.79564571494
No .	1082073.3456515577
FLORRY : ( To Stephen ) I’m sure you’re a spoiled priest .	70624.6447456167
LYNCH : I’m not looking ZOE : ( Makes sheep’s eyes ) No ?	67205.5840176548
The eastern seas .	269669.00293591485
Mr O’Madden Burke asked .	190534.93313985676
( The soldiers turn their swimming eyes ) BLOOM : ( Elbowing through the crowd , plucks Stephen’s sleeve vigorously ) Come now , professor , that carman is waiting .	46464.40882298539
Haihoop !	1082073.3456515577

[ 18 ] Yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the City Arms hotel when he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his highness to make himself interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan that he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing all for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was actually afraid to lay out 4d for her methylated spirit telling me all her ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and earthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first God help the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them I suppose she was pious because no man would look at her twice I hope Ill never be like her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a welleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan here and Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her dog smelling my fur and always edging to get up under my petticoats especially then still I like that in him polite to old women like that and waiters and beggars too hes not proud out of nothing but not always if ever he got anything really serious the matter with him its much better for them to go into a hospital where everything is clean but I suppose Id have to dring it into him for a month yes and then wed have a hospital nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there till they throw him out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as much a nun as Im not yes because theyre so weak and puling when theyre sick they want a woman to get well if his nose bleeds youd think it was O tragic and that dyinglooking one off the south circular when he sprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf Mountain the day I wore that dress Miss Stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones she could find at the bottom of the basket anything at all to get into a mans bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying on account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same besides I hate bandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor paring his corns afraid hed get bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing I was sick then wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it not to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere Im sure by his appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her so either it was one of those night women if it was down there he was really and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it planning it Hynes kept me who did I meet ah yes I met do you remember Menton and who else who let me see that big babbyface I saw him and he not long married flirting with a young girl at Pooles Myriorama and turned my back on him when he slinked out looking quite conscious what harm but he had the impudence to make up to me one time well done to him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all the big stupoes I ever met and thats called a solicitor only for I hate having a long wrangle in bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as I do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a letter when I came into the front room to show him Dignams death in the paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is now so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that I care two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way though Id like to find out so long as I dont have the two of them under my nose all the time like that slut that Mary we had in Ontario terrace padding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell of those painted women off him once or twice I had a suspicion by getting him to come near me when I found the long hair on his coat without that one when I went into the kitchen pretending he was drinking water 1 woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of course ruining servants then proposing that she could eat at our table on Christmas day if you please O no thank you not in my house stealing my potatoes and the oysters <TIME> per doz going out to see her aunt if you please common robbery so it was but I was sure he had something on with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you have no proof it was her proof O yes her aunt was very fond of oysters but I told her what I thought of her suggesting me to go out to be alone with her I wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters I found in her room the Friday she was out that was enough for me a little bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when I gave her her weeks notice I saw to that better do without them altogether do out the rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out the dirt I gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house I couldnt even touch him if I thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar and sloven like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the place in the W C too because she knew she was too well off yes because he couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere and the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night Boylan gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the Tolka in my hand there steals another I just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb to squeeze back singing the young May moon shes beaming love because he has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said Im dining out and going to the Gaiety though Im not going to give him the satisfaction in any case God knows hes a change in a way not to be always and ever wearing the same old hat unless I paid some nicelooking boy to do it since I cant do it myself a young boy would like me Id confuse him a little alone with him if we were Id let him see my garters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him seduce him I know what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that frigging drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this that and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop yes I would because I told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in the jews temples gardens when I was knitting that woollen thing a stranger to Dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and he tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it tell me his name who tell me who the german Emperor is it yes imagine Im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the world about it people make its only the first time after that its just the ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man without going and marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself I wish some man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul almost paralyses you then I hate that confession when I used to go to Father Corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and I said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where you sit down yes O Lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put it I forget no father and I always think of the real father what did he want to know for when I already confessed it to God he had a nice fat hand the palm moist always I wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he Id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar I wonder did he know me in the box I could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them Id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre married hes too careful about himself then give something to H H the pope for a penance I wonder was he satisfied with me one thing I didnt like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall though I laughed Im not a horse or an ass am I I suppose he was thinking of his fathers I wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am I in it who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they stick their bills up with some liqueur Id like to sip those richlooking green and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with the opera hats I tasted once with my finger dipped out of that American that had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took the port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because I felt lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment I popped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up God be merciful to us I thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when I blessed myself and said a Hail Mary like those awful thunderbolts in Gibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and tell you theres no God what could you do if it was running and rushing about nothing only make an act of contrition the candle I lit that evening in Whitefriars street chapel for the month of May see it brought its luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to church mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only grey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when I lit the lamp because he must have come 3 or 4 times with that tremendous big red brute of a thing he has I thought the vein or whatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is not so big after I took off all my things with the blinds down after my hours dressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a thick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters I think a few dozen he was in great singing voice no I never in all my life felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must have eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with a big hole in the middle of us or like a Stallion driving it up into you because thats all they want out of you with that determined vicious look in his eye I had to halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a tremendous amount of spunk in him when I made him pull out and do it on me considering how big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt washed out properly the last time I let him finish it in me nice invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if someone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what I went through with Milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and Mina Purefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up with a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a smell of children off her the one they called budgers or something like a nigger with a shock of hair on it Jesusjack the child is a black the last time I was there a squad of them falling over one another and bawling you couldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied till they have us swollen out like elephants or I dont know what supposing I risked having another not off him though still if he was married Im sure hed have a fine strong child but I dont know Poldy has more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly I suppose it was meeting Josie Powell and the funeral and thinking about me and Boylan set him off well he can think what he likes now if thatll do him any good I know they were spooning a bit when I came on the scene he was dancing and sitting out with her the night of Georgina Simpsons housewarming and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account of not liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup row over politics he began it not me when he said about Our Lord being a carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive about everything I was fuming with myself after for giving in only for I knew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said He was he annoyed me so much I couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of mixedup things especially about the body and the inside I often wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family physician I could always hear his voice talking when the room was crowded and watch him after that I pretended I had a coolness on with her over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going to and I said over to Floey and he made me the present of Byrons poems and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that I could quite easily get him to make it up any time I know how Id even supposing he got in with her again and was going out to see her somewhere Id know if he refused to eat the onions I know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch him with my veil and gloves on going out 1 kiss then would send them all spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she of course would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him that I wouldnt so much mind Id just go to her and ask her do you love him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might imagine he was and make a declaration to her with his plabbery kind of a manner like he did to me though I had the devils own job to get it out of him though I liked him for that it showed he could hold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the night in the kitchen I was rolling the potato cake theres something I want to say to you only for I put him off letting on I was in a temper with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case I let out too much the night before talking of dreams so I didnt want to let him know more than was good for him she used to be always embracing me Josie whenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and when I said I washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did you wash possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on thick when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what spoils him I dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at that time trying to look like Lord Byron I said I liked though he was too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged afterwards though she didnt like it so much the day I was in fits of laughing with the giggles I couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling out one after another with the mass of hair I had youre always in great humour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it meant because I used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault she didnt darken the door much after we were married I wonder what shes got like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time I saw her she must have been just after a row with him because I saw on the moment she was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk about him to run him down what was it she told me O yes that sometimes he used to go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him just imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might murder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes mad Poldy anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when he comes in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he always takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and now hes going about in his slippers to look for 10000 for a postcard U p up O sweetheart May wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff to extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what could you make of a man like that Id rather die 20 times over than marry another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like me to put up with him the way I do know me come sleep with me yes and he knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that Mrs Maybrick that poisoned her husband for what I wonder in love with some other man yes it was found out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and do a thing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating drive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask us to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because they cant get on without us white Arsenic she put in his tea off flypaper wasnt it I wonder why they call it that if I asked him hed say its from the Greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have been madly in love with the other fellow to run the chance of being hanged O she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do besides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they theyre all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot he noticed at once even before he was introduced when I was in the D B C with Poldy laughing and trying to listen I was waggling my foot we both ordered 2 teas and plain bread and butter I saw him looking with his two old maids of sisters when I stood up and asked the girl where it was what do I care with it dropping out of me and that black closed breeches he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting all myself always with some brandnew fad every other week such a long one I did I forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that I never got after some robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the Irish times lost in the ladies lavatory D B C Dame street finder return to Mrs Marion Bloom and I saw his eyes on my feet going out through the turning door he was looking when I looked back and I went there for tea <TIME_PERIOD > after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him because I was crossing them when we were in the other room first he meant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that if I only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice aquamarine Ill stick him for one and a gold bracelet I dont like my foot so much still I made him spend once with my foot the night after Goodwins botchup of a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to mull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my stockings lying on the hearthrug in Lombard street west and another time it was my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung I could find but of course hes not natural like the rest of the world that I what did he say I could give 9 points in 10 to Katty Lanner and beat her what does that mean I asked him I forget what he said because the stoppress edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in the Lucan dairy thats so polite I think I saw his face before somewhere I noticed him when I was tasting the butter so I took my time Bartell DArcy too that he used to make fun of when he commenced kissing me on the choir stairs after I sang Gounods Ave Maria what are we waiting for O my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown part he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too my low notes he was always raving about if you can believe him I liked the way he used his mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a place like that I dont see anything so terrible about it Ill tell him about that some day not now and surprise him ay and Ill take him there and show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an idea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got me so cheap as he did he was 10 times worse himself anyhow begging me to give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming along Kenilworth square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and I had to take it off asking me questions is it permitted to enquire the shape of my bedroom so I let him keep it as if I forgot it to think of me when I saw him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject of drawers thats plain to be seen always skeezing at those brazenfaced things on the bicycles with their skirts blowing up to their navels even when Milly and I were out with him at the open air fete that one in the cream muslin standing right against the sun so he could see every atom she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain I saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner of the Harolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in the Zingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat looking slyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they can go and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on it and were not to ask any questions but they want to know where were you where are you going I could feel him coming along skulking after me his eyes on my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it was getting too warm for him so I halfturned and stopped then he pestered me to say yes till I took off my glove slowly watching him he said my openwork sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed time till I promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry about in his waistcoat pocket O Maria Santisima he did look a big fool dreeping in the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat I had on with the sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in the wet if I didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new raincoat you never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for it if anyone was passing so I lifted them a bit and touched his trousers outside the way I used to Gardner after with my ring hand to keep him from doing worse where it was too public I was dying to find out was he circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting all the time for his dinner he told me to say I left my purse in the butchers and had to go back for it what a Deceiver then he wrote me that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to any woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we met asking me have I offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw I wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool Henny Doyle he was always breaking or tearing something in the charades I hate an unlucky man and if I knew what it meant of course I had to say no for form sake dont understand you I said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it used to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in Gibraltar with that word I couldnt find anywhere only for children seeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice a day I liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman when he sent me the 8 big poppies because mine was the 8th then I wrote the night he kissed my heart at Dolphins barn I couldnt describe it simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to embrace well like Gardner I hope hell come on Monday as he said at the same time four I hate people who come at all hours answer the door you think its the vegetables then its somebody and you all undressed or the door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old frostyface Goodwin called about the concert in Lombard street and I just after dinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me professor I had to say Im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in his way it was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say youre out you have to peep out through the blind like the messengerboy today I thought it was a putoff first him sending the port and the peaches first and I was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was trying to make a fool of me when I knew his tattarrattat at the door he must have been a bit late because it was <TIME> after 3 when I saw the 2 Dedalus girls coming from school I never know the time even that watch he gave me never seems to go properly Id want to get it looked after when I threw the penny to that lame sailor for England home and beauty when I was whistling there is a charming girl I love and I hadnt even put on my clean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week were to go to Belfast just as well he has to go to Ennis his fathers anniversary the 27th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms at the hotel were beside each other and any fooling went on in the new bed I couldnt tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next room or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the wall then hed never believe the next day we didnt do something its all very well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we never did anything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes going where he is besides something always happens with him the time going to the Mallow concert at Maryborough ordering boiling soup for the two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with the soup splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and the waiter after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion for the engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two gentlemen in the 3rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was too hes so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a good job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd have taken us on to Cork I suppose that was done out of revenge on him O I love jaunting in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions I wonder will he take a 1st class for me he might want to do it in the train by tipping the guard well O I suppose therell be the usual idiots of men gaping at us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly be that was an exceptional man that common workman that left us alone in the carriage that day going to Howth Id like to find out something about him 1 or 2 tunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the window all the nicer then coming back suppose I never came back what would they say eloped with him that gets you on on the stage the last concert I sang at where its over a year ago when was it St Teresas hall Clarendon St little chits of missies they have now singing Kathleen Kearney and her like on account of father being in the army and my singing the absentminded beggar and wearing a brooch for Lord Roberts when I had the map of it all and Poldy not Irish enough was it him managed it this time I wouldnt put it past him like he got me on to sing in the Stabat Mater by going around saying he was putting Lead Kindly Light to music I put him up to that till the jesuits found out he was a freemason thumping the piano lead Thou me on copied from some old opera yes and he was going about with some of them Sinner Fein lately or whatever they call themselves talking his usual trash and nonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck is very intelligent the coming man Griffiths is he well he doesnt look it thats all I can say still it must have been him he knew there was a boycott I hate the mention of their politics after the war that Pretoria and Ladysmith and Bloemfontein where Gardner lieut Stanley G 8th Bn 2nd East Lancs Rgt of enteric fever he was a lovely fellow in khaki and just the right height over me Im sure he was brave too he said I was lovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my Irish beauty he was pale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the road he couldnt stand properly and I so hot as I never felt they could have made their peace in the beginning or old oom Paul and the rest of the other old Krugers go and fight it out between them instead of dragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were with their fever if he was even decently shot it wouldnt have been so bad I love to see a regiment pass in review the first time I saw the Spanish cavalry at La Roque it was lovely after looking across the bay from Algeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those sham battles on the 15 acres the Black Watch with their kilts in time at the march past the 10th hussars the prince of Wales own or the lancers O the lancers theyre grand or the Dublins that won Tugela his father made his money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me a nice present up in Belfast after what I gave him theyve lovely linen up there or one of those nice kimono things I must buy a mothball like I had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going round with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the knuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or tell the police on me but theyd think were married O let them all go and smother themselves for the fat lot I care he has plenty of money and hes not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if I could find out whether he likes me I looked a bit washy of course when I looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the expression besides scrooching down on me like that all the time with his big hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat always having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from behind the way Mrs Mastiansky told me her husband made her like the dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so quiet and mild with his tingating cither can you ever be up to men the way it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish tie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly welloff I know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he was like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the stoppress tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost 20 quid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for me on account of Lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that sponger he was making free with me after the Glencree dinner coming back that long joult over the featherbed mountain after the lord Mayor looking at me with his dirty eyes Val Dillon that big heathen I first noticed him at dessert when I was cracking the nuts with my teeth I wished I could have picked every morsel of that chicken out of my fingers it was so tasty and browned and as tender as anything only for I didnt want to eat everything on my plate those forks and fishslicers were hallmarked silver too I wish I had some I could easily have slipped a couple into my muff when I was playing with them then always hanging out of them for money in a restaurant for the bit you put down your throat we have to be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a great compliment to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case if its going to go on I want at least two other good chemises for one thing and but I dont know what kind of drawers he likes none at all I think didnt he say yes and half the girls in Gibraltar never wore them either naked as God made them that Andalusian singing her Manola she didnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second pair of silkette stockings is laddered after one days wear I could have brought them back to Lewers this morning and kicked up a row and made that one change them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into him and ruining the whole thing and one of those kidfitting corsets Id want advertised cheap in the Gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips he saved the one I have but thats no good what did they say they give a delightful figure line <TIME> obviating that unsightly broad appearance across the lower back to reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big Ill have to knock off the stout at dinner or am I getting too fond of it the last they sent from ORourkes was as flat as a pancake he makes his money easy Larry they call him the old mangy parcel he sent at Xmas a cottage cake and a bottle of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret that he couldnt get anyone to drink God spare his spit for fear hed die of the drouth or I must do a few breathing exercises I wonder is that antifat any good might overdo it the thin ones are not so much the fashion now garters that much I have the violet pair I wore today thats all he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first O no there was the face lotion I finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like new I told him over and over again get that made up in the same place and dont forget it God only knows whether he did after all I said to him Ill know by the bottle anyway if not I suppose Ill only have to wash in my piss like beeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax and violet I thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the skin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger after the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry handkerchiefs about 6 - in all sure you cant get on in this world without style all going in food and rent when I get it Ill lash it around I tell you in fine style I always want to throw a handful of tea into the pot measuring and mincing if I buy a pair of old brogues itself do you like those new shoes yes were they Ive no clothes at all the brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the cleaners 3 whats that for any woman cutting up this old hat and patching up the other the men wont look at you and women try to walk on you because they know youve no man then with all the things getting dearer every day for the <TIME_PERIOD > more I have of life up to 35 no Im what am I at all Ill be 33 in September will I what O well look at that Mrs Galbraith shes much older than me I saw her when I was out last week her beautys on the wane she was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair on her down to her waist tossing it back like that like Kitty OShea in Grantham street 1st thing I did every morning to look across see her combing it as if she loved it and was full of it pity I only got to know her the day before we left and that Mrs Langtry the jersey lily the prince of Wales was in love with I suppose hes like the first man going the roads only for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a black mans Id like to try a beauty up to what was she 45 there was some funny story about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster knife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and the prince of Wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing like that like some of those books he brings me the works of Master Francois Somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her ear because her bumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write and her a e as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant I hate that pretending of all things with that old blackguards face on him anybody can see its not true and that Ruby and Fair Tyrants he brought me that twice I remember when I came to page 50 the part about where she hangs him up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing for a woman in that all invention made up about he drinking the champagne out of her slipper after the ball was over like the infant Jesus in the crib at Inchicore in the Blessed Virgins arms sure no woman could have a child that big taken out of her and I thought first it came out of her side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and she a rich lady of course she felt honoured H R H he was in Gibraltar the year I was born I bet he found lilies there too where he planted the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me too if hed come a bit sooner then I wouldnt be here as I am he ought to chuck that Freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it and go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank where they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day of course he prefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with him any side whats your programme today I wish hed even smoke a pipe like father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching about for advertisements when he could have been in Mr Cuffes still only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up I could have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great mirada once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly Mrs Bloom only I felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that I lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming into fashion again I bought it simply to please him I knew it was no good by the finish pity I changed my mind of going to Todd and Burns as I said and not Lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a lot of trash I hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and cooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if I went by his advices every blessed hat I put on does that suit me yes take that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles off my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my backside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in Grafton street I had the misfortune to bring him into and she as insolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying Im afraid were giving you too much trouble what shes there for but I stared it out of her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second time he looked Poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but I could see him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for me it was nice of him to show me out in any case Im extremely sorry Mrs Bloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife I just half smiled I know my chest was out that way at the door when he said Im extremely sorry and Im sure you were yes I think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he made me thirsty titties he calls them I had to laugh yes this one anyhow stiff the nipple gets for the least thing Ill get him to keep that up and Ill take those eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out for him what are all those veins and things curious the way its made 2 the same in case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up there like those statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide it with her hand are they so beautiful of course compared with what a man looks like with his two bags full and his other thing hanging down out of him or sticking up at you like a hatrack no wonder they hide it with a cabbageleaf that disgusting Cameron highlander behind the meat market or that other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the statue of the fish used to be when I was passing pretending he was pissing standing out for me to see it with his babyclothes up to one side the Queens own they were a nice lot its well the Surreys relieved them theyre always trying to show it to you every time nearly I passed outside the mens greenhouse near the Harcourt street station just to try some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was 1 of the 7 wonders of the world O and the stink of those rotten places the night coming home with Poldy after the Comerfords party oranges and lemonade to make you feel nice and watery I went into 1 of them it was so biting cold I couldnt keep it when was that 93 the canal was frozen yes it was a few months after a pity a couple of the Camerons werent there to see me squatting in the mens place meadero I tried to draw a picture of it before I tore it up like a sausage or something I wonder theyre not afraid going about of getting a kick or a bang of something there the woman is beauty of course thats admitted when he said I could pose for a picture naked to some rich fellow in Holles street when he lost the job in Helys and I was selling the clothes and strumming in the coffee palace would I be like that bath of the nymph with my hair down yes only shes younger or Im a little like that dirty bitch in that Spanish photo he has nymphs used they go about like that I asked him about her and that word met something with hoses in it and he came out with some jawbreakers about the incarnation he never can explain a thing simply the way a body can understand then he goes and burns the bottom out of the pan all for his Kidney this one not so much theres the mark of his teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple I had to scream out arent they fearful trying to hurt you I had a great breast of milk with Milly enough for two what was the reason of that he said I could have got a pound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning that delicate looking student that stopped in no 28 with the Citrons Penrose nearly caught me washing through the window only for I snapped up the towel to my face that was his studenting hurt me they used to weaning her till he got doctor Brady to give me the belladonna prescription I had to get him to suck them they were so hard he said it was sweeter and thicker than cows then he wanted to milk me into the tea well hes beyond everything I declare somebody ought to put him in the budget if I only could remember the one half of the things and write a book out of it the works of Master Poldy yes and its so much smoother the skin much an hour he was at them Im sure by the clock like some kind of a big infant I had at me they want everything in their mouth all the pleasure those men get out of a woman I can feel his mouth O Lord I must stretch myself I wished he was here or somebody to let myself go with and come again like that I feel all fire inside me or if I could dream it when he made me spend the 2nd time tickling me behind with his finger I was coming for about 5 minutes with my legs round him I had to hug him after O Lord I wanted to shout out all sorts of things fuck or shit or anything at all only not to look ugly or those lines from the strain who knows the way hed take it you want to feel your way with a man theyre not all like him thank God some of them want you to be so nice about it I noticed the contrast he does it and doesnt talk I gave my eyes that look with my hair a bit loose from the tumbling and my tongue between my lips up to him the savage brute Thursday Friday one Saturday two Sunday three O Lord I cant wait till Monday frseeeeeeeefronnnng train somewhere whistling the strength those engines have in them like big giants and the water rolling all over and out of them all sides like the end of Loves old sweeeetsonnnng the poor men that have to be out all the night from their wives and families in those roasting engines stifling it was today Im glad I burned the half of those old Freemans and Photo Bits leaving things like that lying about hes getting very careless and threw the rest of them up in the W C I’ll get him to cut them tomorrow for me instead of having them there for the next year to get a few pence for them have him asking wheres last Januarys paper and all those old overcoats I bundled out of the hall making the place hotter than it is that rain was lovely and refreshing just after my beauty sleep I thought it was going to get like Gibraltar my goodness the heat there before the levanter came on black as night and the glare of the rock standing up in it like a big giant compared with their 3 Rock mountain they think is so great with the red sentries here and there the poplars and they all whitehot and the smell of the rainwater in those tanks watching the sun all the time weltering down on you faded all that lovely frock fathers friend Mrs Stanhope sent me from the B Marche paris what a shame my dearest Doggerina she wrote on it she was very nice whats this her other name was just a p c to tell you I sent the little present have just had a jolly warm bath and feel a very clean dog now enjoyed it wogger she called him wogger wd give anything to be back in Gib and hear you sing Waiting and in old Madrid Concone is the name of those exercises he bought me one of those new some word I couldnt make out shawls amusing things but tear for the least thing still there lovely I think dont you will always think of the lovely teas we had together scrumptious currant scones and raspberry wafers I adore well now dearest Doggerina be sure and write soon kind she left out regards to your father also Captain Grove with love yrs affly Hester x x x x x she didnt look a bit married just like a girl he was years older than her wogger he was awfully fond of me when he held down the wire with his foot for me to step over at the bullfight at La Linea when that matador Gomez was given the bulls ear these clothes we have to wear whoever invented them expecting you to walk up Killiney hill then for example at that picnic all staysed up you cant do a blessed thing in them in a crowd run or jump out of the way thats why I was afraid when that other ferocious old Bull began to charge the banderilleros with the sashes and the 2 things in their hats and the brutes of men shouting bravo toro sure the women were as bad in their nice white mantillas ripping all the whole insides out of those poor horses I never heard of such a thing in all my life yes he used to break his heart at me taking off the dog barking in bell lane poor brute and it sick what became of them ever I suppose theyre dead long ago the 2 of them its like all through a mist makes you feel so old I made the scones of course I had everything all to myself then a girl Hester we used to compare our hair mine was thicker than hers she showed me how to settle it at the back when I put it up and whats this else how to make a knot on a thread with the one hand we were like cousins what age was I then the night of the storm I slept in her bed she had her arms round me then we were fighting in the morning with the pillow what fun he was watching me whenever he got an opportunity at the band on the Alameda esplanade when I was with father and Captain Grove I looked up at the church first and then at the windows then down and our eyes met I felt something go through me like all needles my eyes were dancing I remember after when I looked at myself in the glass hardly recognised myself the change he was attractive to a girl in spite of his being a little bald intelligent looking disappointed and gay at the same time he was like Thomas in the shadow of Ashlydyat I had a splendid skin from the sun and the excitement like a rose I didnt get a wink of sleep it wouldnt have been nice on account of her but I could have stopped it in time she gave me the Moonstone to read that was the first I read of Wilkie Collins East Lynne I read and the shadow of Ashlydyat Mrs Henry Wood Henry Dunbar by that other woman I lent him afterwards with Mulveys photo in it so as he see I wasnt without and Lord Lytton Eugene Aram Molly bawn she gave me by Mrs Hungerford on account of the name I dont like books with a Molly in them like that one he brought me about the one from Flanders a whore always shoplifting anything she could cloth and stuff and yards of it O this blanket is too heavy on me thats better I havent even one decent nightdress this thing gets all rolled under me besides him and his fooling thats better I used to be weltering then in the heat my shift drenched with the sweat stuck in the cheeks of my bottom on the chair when I stood up they were so fattish and firm when I got up on the sofa cushions to see with my clothes up and the bugs tons of them at night and the mosquito nets I couldnt read a line Lord how long ago it seems centuries of course they never came back and she didnt put her address right on it either she may have noticed her wogger people were always going away and we never I remember that day with the waves and the boats with their high heads rocking and the smell of ship those Officers uniforms on shore leave made me seasick he didnt say anything he was very serious I had the high buttoned boots on and my skirt was blowing she kissed me six or seven times didnt I cry yes I believe I did or near it my lips were taittering when I said goodbye she had a Gorgeous wrap of some special kind of blue colour on her for the voyage made very peculiarly to one side like and it was extremely pretty it got as dull as the devil after they went I was almost planning to run away mad out of it somewhere were never easy where we are father or aunt or marriage waiting always waiting to guiiiide him toooo me waiting nor speeeed his flying feet their damn guns bursting and booming all over the shop especially the Queens birthday and throwing everything down in all directions if you didnt open the windows when general Ulysses Grant whoever he was or did supposed to be some great fellow landed off the ship and old Sprague the consul that was there from before the flood dressed up poor man and he in mourning for the son then the same old bugles for reveille in the morning and drums rolling and the unfortunate poor devils of soldiers walking about with messtins smelling the place more than the old longbearded jews in their jellibees and levites assembly and sound clear and gunfire for the men to cross the lines and the warden marching with his keys to lock the gates and the bagpipes and only captain Groves and father talking about Rorkes drift and Plevna and sir Garnet Wolseley and Gordon at Khartoum lighting their pipes for them everytime they went out drunken old devil with his grog on the windowsill catch him leaving any of it picking his nose trying to think of some other dirty story to tell up in a corner but he never forgot himself when I was there sending me out of the room on some blind excuse paying his compliments the Bushmills whisky talking of course but hed do the same to the next woman that came along I suppose he died of galloping drink ages ago the days like years not a letter from a living soul except the odd few I posted to myself with bits of paper in them so bored sometimes I could fight with my nails listening to that old Arab with the one eye and his heass of an instrument singing his heah heah aheah all my compriment on your hotchapotch of your heass as bad as now with the hands hanging off me looking out of the window if there was a nice fellow even in the opposite house that medical in Holles street the nurse was after when I put on my gloves and hat at the window to show I was going out not a notion what I meant arent they thick never understand what you say even youd want to print it up on a big poster for them not even if you shake hands twice with the left he didnt recognise me either when I half frowned at him outside Westland row chapel where does their great intelligence come in Id like to know grey matter they have it all in their tail if you ask me those country gougers up in the City Arms intelligence they had a damn sight less than the bulls and cows they were selling the meat and the coalmans bell that noisy bugger trying to swindle me with the wrong bill he took out of his hat what a pair of paws and pots and pans and kettles to mend any broken bottles for a poor man today and no visitors or post ever except his cheques or some advertisement like that wonderworker they sent him addressed dear Madam only his letter and the card from Milly this morning see she wrote a letter to him who did I get the last letter from O Mrs Dwenn now what possessed her to write from Canada after so many years to know the recipe I had for pisto madrileno Floey Dillon since she wrote to say she was married to a very rich architect if Im to believe all I hear with a villa and eight rooms her father was an awfully nice man he was near seventy always goodhumoured well now Miss Tweedy or Miss Gillespie theres the piannyer that was a solid silver coffee service he had too on the mahogany sideboard then dying so far away I hate people that have always their poor story to tell everybody has their own troubles that poor Nancy Blake died a month ago of acute neumonia well I didnt know her so well as all that she was Floeys friend more than mine poor Nancy its a bother having to answer he always tells me the wrong things and no stops to say like making a speech your sad bereavement symph athy I always make that mistake and new phew with 2 double yous in I hope hell write me a longer letter the next time if its a thing he really likes me O thanks be to the great God I got somebody to give me what I badly wanted to put some heart up into me youve no chances at all in this place like you used long ago I wish somebody would write me a loveletter his wasnt much and I told him he could write what he liked yours ever Hugh Boylan in old Madrid stuff silly women believe love is sighing I am dying still if he wrote it I suppose thered be some truth in it true or no it fills up your whole day and life always something to think about every moment and see it all round you like a new world I could write the answer in bed to let him imagine me short just a few words not those long crossed letters Atty Dillon used to write to the fellow that was something in the four courts that jilted her after out of the ladies letterwriter when I told her to say a few simple words he could twist how he liked not acting with precipat precipitancy with equal candour the greatest earthly happiness answer to a gentlemans proposal affirmatively my goodness theres nothing else its all very fine for them but as for

and ofttimes the beauty of poetry , so sad in its transient loveliness , had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the years were slipping by for her , one by one , and but for that one shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an accident coming down Dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it .	39106.30889107433

MRS BELLINGHAM : Me too .	148668.86573605234
And later on at a propitious opportunity he purposed ( Bloom did ) , without anyway prying into his private affairs on the fools step in where angels principle , advising him to sever his connection with a certain budding practitioner who , he noticed , was prone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious pretext when not present , deprecate him , or whatever you like to call it which in Bloom’s humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of a person’s character , no pun intended .	37396.86141700639
