Average perplexity: 6573.6059762735795
I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner .	6355.215926700575
and to him she had hardly courage to speak .	6038.117337181991
At that ball , while I had the honour of dancing with you , I was first made acquainted , by Sir William Lucas's accidental information , that Bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage .	4384.9568896165465
My aunt Philips came to Longbourn on Tuesday , after my father went away ;	5700.3002398917415
Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Robinson ;	7733.929680100861
I should take him , even on my slight acquaintance , to be an ill-tempered man .	4850.245376782731
The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret .	5589.098557792309
That is all very proper and civil , I am sure , said Bennet , and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman .	3813.652455855285
When I went away , I felt that it would soon happen .	6145.234586364385
and she felt capable under such circumstances , of endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters .	4611.924560432769
But that is not the case here .	6837.920829577346
Such I was , from eight to eight and twenty ;	7882.606845492171
and so extremely accomplished for her age !	6428.216391889979
or at least it was impossible not to try for information .	6791.017060720321
Nor I , I am sure , said Miss Bingley .	6569.494561648602
The day passed most pleasantly away ;	8198.321871905062
There has been many a one , I fancy , overcome in the same way .	6061.125482634854
It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week .	4910.988566650175
for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know , and read great books , and make extracts .	5421.796064217735
and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon , was such an instance of Lady Catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough .	4332.55588704799
She was quite amazed at her own discomposure ;	5734.734748893277
How abominable !	14891.117005620777
After a few minutes reflection , however , she continued , I do remember his boasting one day , at Netherfield , of the implacability of his resentments , of his having an unforgiving temper .	4508.1356235157255
Elizabeth again , and more seriously assured her of its truth .	6490.573174578448
and the effort which the formation , and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read .	4144.1525654854395
these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce ;	6890.608367827997
and I have enquired of every body too , who is likely to know .	4696.4884666177895
Here was knowledge in which no one could partake ;	8572.385705047465
C below .	21632.83805867054
The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents , about a twelvemonth ago , was now brought forward again .	4902.64668593141
but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine .	5940.195509773339
Since her being at Lambton , she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud ;	6684.304412424384
and oh !	11213.825234552001
Did you see it ?	11246.155839591678
I must be in town next Saturday .	6193.355548148088
A lady's imagination is very rapid ;	9312.947839979217
They stood for some time without speaking a word ;	6909.5572906598
The morrow produced no abatement of Bennet's ill humour or ill health .	6162.242380864301
He had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them ;	5196.272846970698
She told the story however with great spirit among her friends ;	6320.484288994233
How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter !	6898.9545302259385
If I had known as much this morning , I certainly would not have called on him .	5131.075432307864
The old lady is Jenkinson , who lives with them .	6618.13045543331
At least , therefore , I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies .	5312.613713929394
Bennet , in equal silence , was enjoying the scene .	6345.266592464451
That his two sisters and Darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough , and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable .	4295.132230057425
I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous elopement .	4548.874875153353
and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and forwarded , as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side .	3999.111480570103
and the beautiful pyramids of grapes , nectarines , and peaches , soon collected them round the table .	4587.473650194699
Transcriber's note : Spelling and hyphen changes have been made so that there is consistency within the book .	6509.535052087522
But I must tell you how it went off .	5442.212394011287
He bore it however with admirable calmness .	7133.14584540084
To be sure , you knew no actual good of me but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love .	4936.574270620912
Why should they try to influence him ?	8544.86873690138
His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others , as in his reproaches to myself .	4754.7197199637485
and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own , it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance .	3955.4191291495026
Elizabeth was not surprised at it , as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill .	4941.726779024888
that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation , than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance .	4936.145540373884
You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas .	5770.335636709548
People do not die of little trifling colds .	9686.967842588996
With all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it , am I wrong , my dearest Jane , in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many ?	4542.701983451753
And then we were so merry all the way home !	6492.315122663098
Indeed , Mama , you are mistaken , said Elizabeth , blushing for her mother .	5921.676327730607
I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat .	5719.627236165202
and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley .	4063.8228170020243
No , indeed , I did not .	7069.091159444181
Darcy's letter , she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart .	6905.8571838014495
I cannot think so very ill of Wickham .	5591.230537558779
he actually danced with her twice ;	9771.655591139865
and Jane more especially , who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself , had she been the culprit , was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure .	4347.654449964921
said Lydia stoutly , I am not afraid ;	8258.12501872967
and Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages .	4384.296062184896
Lizzy , why am I thus singled from my family , and blessed above them all !	5932.581921235286
though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present , because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character .	4109.164007645098
The idea of Collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther , and he continued : My reasons for marrying are , first , that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances ( like myself ) to set the example of matrimony in his parish .	3873.682522466329
Upon my word !	10886.552727796308
and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , she could , perhaps , believe , that remaining partiality for her , might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned .	3991.8940198781984
Her favourite walk , and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine , was along the open grove which edged that side of the park , where there was a nice sheltered path , which no one seemed to value but herself , and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity .	4148.519350184765
I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear .	3853.3622967387523
And what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail ?	5500.664998617176
Widely different was the effect of a second perusal .	9475.98293518256
We will know where we have gone we will recollect what we have seen .	5930.10502500362
Her fellow-travellers the next day , were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable .	5596.740057174866
And then when we came away it was such fun !	6492.198590194316
or rather he has not Wickham's countenance , for his features are perfectly good .	6718.8553849651635
How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence , she could not imagine .	5906.425831239253
for at any rate , there seemed a gulf impassable between them .	6601.625709132931
and she told me that it was certain true .	5258.593082712736
His regard for her was quite imaginary ;	8453.130565045667
and for the last half year , nay , for a twelvemonth , she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity .	4584.943364301557
Her astonishment , however , was extreme ;	7685.62483714544
This is the estimation in which you hold me !	6383.530145769401
when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them , and Elizabeth , looking earnestly in her face , was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever .	5016.693089531514
In short , my dear aunt , I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy ;	4905.960330661329

What will become of me .	9177.48535986169
But do you always write such charming long letters to her , Darcy ?	5472.475291047129
But how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable ?	5870.2237600006
but checking himself , he added in a gayer tone , Is it in address that he improves ?	5321.0056091255265
Professor Michael S Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone .	5651.809719104259
This account then is what he has received from Darcy .	7247.420746193597
They were interrupted by Miss Bennet , who came to fetch her mother's tea .	5366.148110497864
and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity .	5139.148688431937
she is not acting by design .	9230.990071470736
Jane was not happy .	9552.070717662977
Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers , and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed , or a really new muslin in a shop window , could recal them .	4529.04024489583
it gives such an elegance to misfortune !	8912.847479189199
Other schemes too came into her head .	10714.69959417815
I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister .	5009.704319315336
If I were as rich as Darcy , cried a young Lucas who came with his sisters , I should not care how proud I was .	4543.022352789884
I shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier .	5266.852260328426
though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm , at her lively , sportive , manner of talking to her brother .	5239.333840484149
1 .	12212.55279990698
Yes , madam , said Bennet , delighted to speak to a lady Catherine .	5482.352699817736
Pray , what is your age ?	10209.853748505426
And one of my own daughters .	8624.746504927383

I have been most highly gratified indeed , my dear Such very superior dancing is not often seen .	4282.266426828357
If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of , the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time , for from the day of the invitation , to the day of the ball , there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once .	4082.7393593018523
To this , Mary very gravely replied , Far be it from me , my dear sister , to depreciate such pleasures .	4836.912649694773
In the evening , soon after Bennet withdrew to the library , she saw Darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme .	4561.898283811923
She saw instantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage ;	5484.439480955833
Her answer was warmly in his favour .	8106.088669800178
Darcy made no answer , and seemed desirous of changing the subject .	5968.137107565333
How are they even to be discovered ?	8253.390785817257
She enquired after his sister , but could do no more .	6171.570798143824
she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined in company with him four times .	5546.250916788771
Are you much acquainted with Darcy ?	9188.611266649616
We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton .	6015.891146963037
My object then , replied Darcy , was to shew you , by every civility in my power , that I was not so mean as to resent the past ;	4696.6032237218615
How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains !	6493.8606020088755
I mean , that no man in his senses , would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a-year during my life , and fifty after I am gone .	4462.385261573594
You must not suspect me .	6833.8776270906765
Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred , during their visit , as they returned , except what had particularly interested them both .	5057.141874934412
Who would have thought it !	9754.079002632569
I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment .	4311.113743117489
Our plain manner of living , our small rooms , and few domestics , and the little we see of the world , must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself ;	4862.458895655244
You dare not , you cannot deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of dividing them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind .	4097.160241210929
When they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ;	4962.534111789515
Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow .	7620.492791820571
In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion , with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode , and the improvements it was receiving , he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them ;	4392.535104473157
I will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away , and come back again .	4309.795645417747
Well , Lizzy , said Bennet one day , what is your opinion now of this sad business of Jane's ?	4884.207815794147
But I hope you will not mind it : it is all for Jane's sake , you know ;	4271.990571510399
and it is that which makes the wonder .	5882.993807800153
She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought ;	5041.466159749244
Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment , nor were the other ladies often absent ;	5259.995298156064
Darcy danced only once with Hurst and once with Miss Bingley , declined being introduced to any other lady , and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room , speaking occasionally to one of his own party .	4418.944676828404
and though his pride was hurt , he suffered in no other way .	4988.872203620437
The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master , who was coming down in a day or two , to shoot there for several weeks .	4432.862966630476
There is a lady , it seems , a Younge , who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what .	4185.6179318253535
He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her ;	4765.187012189354
He had not been long seated before he complimented Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters , said he had heard much of their beauty , but that , in this instance , fame had fallen short of the truth ;	4113.323408592881
Miss Bingley was engrossed by Darcy , her sister scarcely less so ;	5700.582831402813
They will have nothing else to do .	7279.574049104702
In point of composition , said Mary , his letter does not seem defective .	6134.496374041455
he was lively and unreserved , danced every dance , was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield .	4961.656949513386
it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her .	5210.035672119169
That is his notion of christian forgiveness !	7114.965516272753
what hours of transport we shall spend !	9767.695682389953
Oh !	6826.5207498362
so much ease , with such perfect good breeding !	8030.166720681095
Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness .	5952.833637064835
It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night .	4992.249203818183
I cannot quite agree with you there .	5982.252215891733
it is just as he chooses .	8796.258716498663
I am not romantic you know .	4650.136786037583
Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed , a mixture of pride and impertinence ;	5736.664246955095
She was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself ;	5018.471144739237
But there are two things that I want very much to know : one is , how much money your uncle has laid down , to bring it about ;	4482.408219241587
but that is what a governess will prevent , and if I had known your mother , I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one .	4584.736258482863
There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention , while she added , When I said that he improved on acquaintance , I did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement , but that from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood .	4017.3804060806306
Colonel Forster is a sensible man , and will keep her out of any real mischief ;	5850.138828295689
The reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as I have given above .	5089.5435698820975
Both changed colour , one looked white , the other red .	8086.499086453188
It had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town ;	5089.970211148608
but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended ;	5732.419241159768
Darcy !	14999.807558074162
Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far ;	7861.744818784409
though it had not occurred to me before .	8061.439649620911
to own the truth , with Wickham !	9847.072484464205
Her hopes were answered ;	10877.465746757922
He was my godfather , and excessively attached to me .	5628.563430979856
Well , well , said he , do not make yourself unhappy .	5499.4156680219985
This is quite shocking !	9264.003228282012
How hard it is in some cases to be believed !	7200.237763787282
and he was always the sweetest-tempered , most generous-hearted , boy in the world .	4572.343659366513
and after observing Collins for a few moments , he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh .	4198.828851082894

and depend upon it , you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this , as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire .	4245.611605618759
it must be so , while he retains the use of his reason .	6213.047090817744
Vain , ignorant , idle , and absolutely uncontrouled !	8977.46562859135
but Jane happened to look round , and happened to smile : it was decided .	5469.946548905007
And is it really true ?	8794.429523835868
The letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so .	5437.177804194118
Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters .	6203.596487548915
Collins !	19628.28379738893
Without a governess you must have been neglected .	9533.8906793828
Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening , but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine , and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time .	4053.8561168122746

for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her .	5051.001815325561
after honestly telling her what she thought , she thus went on : You are too sensible a girl , Lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are warned against it ;	4959.966492911961
And so , Darcy did every thing ;	6584.824315732416

said he , smiling .	9931.999944351259
Gardiner did not write again , till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster ;	6041.031366821886
But before they heard again from Gardiner , a letter arrived for their father , from a different quarter , from Collins ;	4871.031166763162
how acutely did she now feel it .	9572.858094465937
cried Jane .	16370.179325817406
I never heard any thing so abominable .	5423.2277995732675
It was at Sir William Lucas's , where a large party were assembled .	4970.954552075182
but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield , and leave the next generation to purchase .	4013.532945639713
Her father had most cruelly mortified her , by what he said of Darcy's indifference , and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that perhaps , instead of his seeing too little , she might have fancied too much .	4150.00587847088
and though feeling no reliance on her , could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved .	4444.075657900029
Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Bingley's name had been last mentioned between them ;	5410.6628861403715
CHAPTER XVI .	13083.650239159624
Did you go by the village of Kympton ?	8280.967963318575
Bennet's expectations were fully answered .	12170.722047920483
Will you come and see me ?	10290.776415760827
1 .	12212.55279990698
As she pronounced these words , Darcy changed colour ;	7215.722309466232
They all paint tables , cover skreens and net purses .	6789.579705034644
But now we may be silent .	7194.962463061385
After a short silence , the lady first spoke .	7054.860014016078
But here , by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister's absence , I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized .	4502.15673012002
Elizabeth obeyed , and running into her own room for her parasol , attended her noble guest down stairs .	5317.655725164071
For about three years I heard little of him ;	8156.599535508477
Has your governess left you ?	12342.318502566179
but I was over-ruled , as I always am .	5757.495919802662
The family were assembled in the breakfast room , to receive them .	6162.242380864301
and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion .	5877.255831144803
Unless the elder brother is very sickly , I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds .	6400.5225609200415
If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him ;	5068.973048320999
but so we all were .	8784.497221734367
Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew , but he had never seen any thing but affability in her .	4739.927402931351
Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had , from the distress of the moment , been led to make Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister ;	4246.256091953898
Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter , that Charlotte , really rejoicing in the match , was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over .	4328.933544293711
You are to understand , Miss Bennet , that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose ;	4569.428126275447
She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs .	6320.484288994233
The farewell between herself and Wickham was perfectly friendly ;	6907.696563388866
I wonder , said he , at the next opportunity of speaking , whether he is likely to be in this country much longer .	4552.9731421609085
She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance , Hurst and Miss Bingley .	4319.015526506647
And , if I may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your lady possesses .	4667.878327903437
it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours , which the discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable ;	5057.608995920176
Let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers .	6560.038549700168
In comparing her recollection of Pemberley , with the minute description which Wickham could give , and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor , she was delighting both him and herself .	4503.930571596333
He was growing quite inattentive to other people , and wholly engrossed by her .	5112.984192489751
I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Darcy .	5177.571238631326
She had better have stayed at home , cried Elizabeth ;	5380.148271837826
On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn , your uncle had a most unexpected visitor .	5305.789836215407
and , turning to Elizabeth , said , Miss Eliza Bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room .	4126.548582696651
It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both ;	4792.983738639512
Yes ;	11624.632075734577
The favour of your company has been much felt , I assure you .	5378.541919525116
We have heard nothing from town .	7905.452728550197
Really , Collins , cried Elizabeth with some warmth , you puzzle me exceedingly .	7229.501592966791
They are gone down to Newcastle , a place quite northward , it seems , and there they are to stay , I do not know how long .	4416.640229927411
Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather , which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Wickham ;	5682.676855363189
and , in short , as the time drew near , she would have been very sorry for any delay .	4114.2116729430345
But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation , she made no answer .	4961.898591526049
Perhaps we might be deceived .	11116.320151180227
the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father ;	5880.460246025948
Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there , that day ;	5601.016457318334
E9 .	22111.518280636905
One seems so forlorn without them .	10414.726981663032
I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever .	4666.622336123766
You need not send them word at Longbourn of my going , if you do not like it , for it will make the surprise the greater , when I write to them , and sign my name Lydia Wickham .	4168.41019647695
but he never distinguished her by any particular attention , and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourites .	4060.7500782263955
Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure , and she was eagerly calling out , while her daughter read , Well , Jane , who is it from ?	5153.833814052781
I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more .	4124.211399456293
His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling .	8453.130565045667
but now as the first shock is over , shall I own that I long for your return ?	5169.5887688182775
My faults , according to this calculation , are heavy indeed !	6721.055552627115
You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for resisting every repetition of it .	4778.623663654188
She practises very constantly .	9594.870681843948
She had very little notice from any but him .	5690.250169205728
In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley , whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose .	4591.401177516915
but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at Hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of and Collins's happiness ;	4085.4604666213736
Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all ;	8901.060544562486
Upon the whole , I am much pleased with him .	7339.72681485279
Collins , you must send a servant with them .	7114.997824677645
It is a grievous affair to my poor girls , you must confess .	4550.995499046515
and when the carriage drove up to the door , the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces , and displayed itself over their whole bodies , in a variety of capers and frisks , was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome .	3886.1609395149603
It was impossible to imagine ;	6207.645481208364
That is very true , replied Elizabeth , and I could easily forgive his pride , if he had not mortified mine .	4450.276889589984
The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial , and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded , as having passed at the Netherfield ball , and as confirming all his first disapprobation , could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers .	4182.866788096306
If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room , I shall be very thankful ;	4781.411831346711
But in all , and in almost every line of each , there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style , and which , proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself , and kindly disposed towards every one , had been scarcely ever clouded .	4015.9967916327123
I saw them the night before last .	6971.646306770604
With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes , did Lydia , assisted by Kitty's hints and additions , endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn .	4754.979059333599
Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ?	6356.186328500302
I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women .	4616.959653473778
She would be in nobody's way , you know , in that part of the house .	5294.56796557686
Oh !	6826.5207498362
and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother , and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance , particularly grateful to the daughter .	4241.53361494914
the turning past , he was immediately before them .	8053.675219095342
They had frequently been staying with her in town .	6510.232060294899
They will take care not to outrun their income .	6778.367752221154
These two girls had been above an hour in the place , happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner , watching the sentinel on guard , and dressing a sallad and cucumber .	4954.976957254361
How you must have hated me after that evening ?	7557.628388468594
She is all affability and condescension , and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over .	4411.572712251118
If she heard me , it was by good luck , for I am sure she did not listen .	5315.259411411162
He smiled , looked handsome , and said many pretty things .	6128.147298288392
The very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour , and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of .	4543.555534966599
By this time she is actually with them !	8281.137363206466
Not these two or three years perhaps .	8978.136308329638
and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable .	4050.023894612133
It amazes me , I confess ;	8259.944069357607
Miss Bennet , do you know who I am ?	6673.393407538747
As they walked home , Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen ;	5323.188802152342
Its business office is located at 8<DATE> West , Salt Lake City , UT 84116 , ( 801 ) 596-1887 .	5947.092802222945
and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably , when the sound of horses drew their notice , and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street .	4144.1369043322
Supposing him to be attached to me , would my refusing to accept his hand , make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ?	5651.757374688661
That had his actions been what Wickham represented them , so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world ;	5023.136005313113
Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent ;	6173.198628592303
Dining out , said Bennet , that is very unlucky .	8679.33972775773
Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a depravity , to which the separation of two young persons , whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison .	4169.928399162497
Charlotte tried to console her .	12024.028991652165
one meets it every where .	12548.429564955046
they are even impartial towards Miss King .	9260.635088188626
You shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very dreadful .	6229.285334202565
It may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement .	4087.1476907204196
After lamenting it however at some length , she had the consolation of thinking that Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn , and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that , though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses .	4216.041817006553
For my part , I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody .	5573.476096537191
Mary , however , continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them .	5748.324770745643
I am always glad to get a young person well placed out .	4722.103069946162
She shook her head .	9213.746019387612
The park was very large , and contained great variety of ground .	6162.242380864301
what could she mean by it ?	10644.5571306853
Darcy may hug himself .	10675.31105657577
The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her .	6907.696563388866
and I am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not .	3900.1381251749494
It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing , said Bingley .	5729.165647108958
Most willingly .	20295.41770017404
But do not imagine that he is always here so often .	5674.78927491334
If you were sensible of your own good , you would not wish to quit the sphere , in which you have been brought up .	4488.013119256672
When I consider , she added , in a yet more agitated voice , that I might have prevented it !	5080.122650762675
The little Gardiners , attracted by the sight of a chaise , were standing on the steps of the house , as they entered the paddock ;	4638.357366176452
It keeps him in good humour , said she , and I am more obliged to you than I can express .	5035.944276105636
Say that urgent business calls us home immediately .	10178.436969860899
every body says that he is ate up with pride , and I dare say he had heard somehow that Long does not keep a carriage , and had come to the ball in a hack chaise .	4650.309907850856
But they did pass away , and and Gardiner , with their four children , did at length appear at Longbourn .	4932.0246341227985
He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention .	5938.637523237419
Let me mend it for you .	8563.423099724687
Her heart had been but slightly touched , and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice , had fortune permitted it .	4769.1368423693175
I do think Long is as good a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls , and not at all handsome : I like them prodigiously .	4155.403208211556
On his quitting the room , she sat down , unable to support herself , and looking so miserably ill , that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her , or to refrain from saying , in a tone of gentleness and commiseration , Let me call your maid .	4176.729480372125
1813 .	29757.454875608575
Upon this signal , the youngest of her daughters put herself forward .	7067.101735874575
Bennet had many grievances to relate , and much to complain of .	6225.236246416528
You take delight in vexing me .	8130.635954654066
For my part , Bingley , I always keep servants that can do their own work ;	5660.192296415231
Darcy , you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner .	5153.742329576734
He owed a good deal in the town , but his debts of honour were still more formidable .	5374.966820697106
Darcy's shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict , gave her a keener sense of her sister's sufferings .	5678.5308862654165
They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her , and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her , So , Miss Eliza , I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham !	4290.479674829293
yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week .	7824.8349782146615
I must have employment and society .	6282.081593173932
It would be nothing ;	7725.890532532089
and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room .	4943.225555561533
I should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me .	4784.993755769096
No , no , you shall not deceive me .	5935.9179223935
that to be in the same room , the same party with him for so many hours together , might be more than I could bear , and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself .	4669.512469388924
And then , said she , if that very improbable event should ever take place , I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself .	4333.691217494866
Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment ;	8572.385705047465
After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour , without hearing Miss Bingley's voice , Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family .	4387.600424857689
it had been written five days ago .	8912.94593649374
I do not know the particulars , but I know very well that Darcy is not in the least to blame , that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned , and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way .	3495.9250155319414
Yes , very handsome .	8053.710211770907
my uncle !	18013.10724036334
But in such cases as these , a good memory is unpardonable .	5648.604333134299
Darcy !	14999.807558074162
Collins made his declaration in form .	9548.108779207316
Lady Catherine rose also , and they turned back .	6582.976624037205
My good opinion once lost is lost for ever .	6637.370990948115
Send back your answer as soon as you can , and be careful to write explicitly .	6555.219598972507
The feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation .	4695.586559678201
They found Mary , as usual , deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature ;	5639.130842912865
CHAPTER XXI .	15231.67119605404
Their table was superlatively stupid .	10732.537798782389
Jane now came up .	11682.816353253438
She then took a large house in Edward-street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings .	5023.735249138557
CHAPTER XIX .	11746.06741553873
and now , my dear Jane , what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business ?	4349.254846952735
And what arts did he use to separate them ?	6384.327434422732
Mary and Kitty have been very kind , and would have shared in every fatigue , I am sure , but I did not think it right for either of them .	4419.0504297934785
cried Elizabeth , with the greatest satisfaction .	7227.678074705085
Again his astonishment was obvious ;	13144.561671774996
Why did not you all learn ?	9756.088946984573
Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy , though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Bingley's regard , and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it .	4583.131158623197
He was then , he said , on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her .	4795.777655439969
It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single .	5696.938488689633
At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies , by not asking them to dance , and I spoke to him twice myself , without receiving an answer .	4844.016514901269
Your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man I know ;	6051.306830822713
As it was certain , however , that somebody was coming , Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion , and walk away with him into the shrubbery .	4570.232475317535
There can be no doubt of that .	7764.3975199539345
and besides all this , she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking , the tone of her voice , her address and expressions , or the word will be but half deserved .	4227.930564098196
Good bye .	15987.831621001465
Bingley arrived .	15866.183850031004
Yes that is what makes it amusing .	8661.050323660955
yes ;	24007.2298619591
I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me ;	4694.261047410615
and from her correspondence with her sister , there was still less to be learnt for her letters to Kitty , though rather longer , were much too full of lines under the words to be made public .	4173.072180651813
but the latter half , which was dated a day later , and written in evident agitation , gave more important intelligence .	4697.931413781606
He knows where we live .	8655.16129069169
and , among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army .	4386.844813987807
In truth I must acknowledge that , with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage , I should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion , while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings .	4478.318664121942
You do not blame me , however , for refusing him ?	5825.744157850028
for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion , I should at present detest his very name , and wish him all manner of evil .	4935.554848310951
and from the observation of the day altogether , she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented .	4657.60762261229
I do not wish to avoid the walk .	4603.6925493368035
What pin-money , what jewels , what carriages you will have !	6879.355721430383
Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl , and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose .	4707.870287849345
She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Forster , and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton , where the temptations must be greater than at home .	4077.7812869859267
but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others , and she had no opportunity of detaining them .	5014.997142569849
All Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away ;	7848.760118101239
I described , and enforced them earnestly .	7192.436393339187
for , of course , they were to have a son .	6368.229662376419
But is it certain , absolutely certain ?	7569.394349723822
Mr .	29757.454875608575
CHAPTER XVII .	11746.06741553873
She was not equal , however , to much conversation , and when Miss Bingley left them together , could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with .	4052.1795501495267
so I will dictate , and you write for me .	7958.775536014851
The surprise of such an application was great indeed ;	6544.292966201631
but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much .	4834.527385197666
He has been accused of many faults at different times ;	5663.7231130527325
Have you had any flirting ?	10616.29699542704
and luckily for the others , the business of love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company .	5062.235118658694
What shall we do with him ?	9136.71341938942
First , that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion ;	6572.319082544334
and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , I hope , acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Wickham .	4149.031404086619
For your sake , turning to Charlotte , I am glad of it ;	6674.423070680194
Design !	29757.454875608575
She is a very good kind of girl , I believe .	4443.156268025224
Every savage can dance .	12484.7689842853
At length , every idea seemed to fail him ;	6440.298281648387
Oh !	6826.5207498362
END OF VOL .	15836.337524380288
F5 .	29757.454875608575
I have heard , indeed , that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two .	4430.814721893975
I will only say farther , that from what passed that evening , my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me before , to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection .	3968.6063545572115
Catherine , weak-spirited , irritable , and completely under Lydia's guidance , had been always affronted by their advice ;	6246.510457995342
The moral will be perfectly fair .	8198.321871905062
and she lay awake two whole hours , endeavouring to make them out .	4821.294229937387
F3 , this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' , WITH NO OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND , EXPRESS OR IMPLIED , INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE .	4828.5727287810405
Let me advise you then , my dear Sir , to console yourself as much as possible , to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever , and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence .	4261.484492714627
how would she have behaved ?	11505.615148230288
There , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard .	4717.340570301385
She could think of nothing but of Wickham , and of what he had told her , all the way home ;	4266.15039148955
There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley , that could provoke his ridicule , or disgust him into silence ;	4940.1448618911845
and the possibility of her deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret .	4847.692004698102
Her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely recollected her interest in the affair , and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth , seemed to have fixed them on her more , and more cheerfully .	4352.9341032706425
It does not necessarily follow that a deep , intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours .	4847.745955938363
His sense of her inferiority of its being a degradation of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination , were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding , but was very unlikely to recommend his suit .	4345.9066481664895
and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged , as by no means unpleasing , though it could not be exactly defined .	4097.953754603728
or at least , by the predominance of virtue , atone for those casual errors , under which she would endeavour to class , what Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance .	4607.645350357019
Colonel Fitzwilliam , who led the way , was about thirty , not handsome , but in person and address most truly the gentleman .	5189.8475324119745
and till the morrow , their going was deferred .	6038.059571646883
Anxious and uneasy , the period which passed in the drawing-room , before the gentlemen came , was wearisome and dull to a degree , that almost made her uncivil .	5283.952574948593
I have nothing to say against him ;	5445.475420486462
She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged .	5401.065732310691
Gardiner was surprised and concerned ;	10077.374588780109
They are my old friends .	8109.873991858827
And that I suppose is one of your sisters .	6507.579481059266
My mother means well ;	9543.772120520307
I shall like it of all things .	5982.252215891733
I do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to .	3818.034776735796
Have a little compassion on my nerves .	9847.072484464205
And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman , Ma'am ?	6057.902894622802
It was not all settled before Monday : as soon as it was , the express was sent off to Longbourn .	4214.521374057685
Their manners are not equal to his .	9025.712578995852
His behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire .	5131.912840885258
CHAPTER IV .	11746.06741553873
It is done , however , and it was done for the best .	4895.426185310377
and all that I can hope in this case is , that she is deceived herself .	5032.439459141044
and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate .	4703.97651533394
and with a more smiling solemnity replied , It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably .	4561.466523856083
But Jane could think with certainty on only one point , that Bingley , if he had been imposed on , would have much to suffer when the affair became public .	4462.059851470507
She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind .	5084.875364928698
It is a nice long walk , and Darcy has never seen the view .	4490.445250677896
our authority was too good .	13144.561671774996
Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the good will of Hurst and Miss Bingley ;	5846.024191519575
He has many friends , and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing .	4823.8607592567005
She talked on , therefore , without interruption from any of them till they were joined by Collins , who entered with an air more stately than usual , and on perceiving whom , she said to the girls , Now , I do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your tongues , and let Collins and me have a little conversation together .	3963.942690239501
that was impossible ;	14156.330524659112
It cannot be concealed from any one .	6829.231042344079
Denny addressed them directly , and entreated permission to introduce his friend , Wickham , who had returned with him the day before from town , and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps .	4817.4472269740845
but perhaps you would like to read it .	7204.1816963830615
Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance .	9475.89221511754
Oh !	6826.5207498362
said Jane faintly smiling , You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , I could not hesitate .	5230.560066667626
They were soon gone again , rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise , and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Bennet's civilities .	4398.77697633689
She held out her hand ;	8750.12651669961
the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door , and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual .	4987.303208445614
Bennet protested against any description of finery .	8571.485715523355
and pride has often been his best friend .	6792.738636346012
Elizabeth related to Jane the next day , what had passed between Wickham and herself .	5764.820129532125
When the tea-things were removed , and the card tables placed , the ladies all rose , and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him , when all her views were overthrown , by seeing him fall a victim to her mother's rapacity for whist players , and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party .	3916.3741206959444
They were to be off as soon as possible .	5872.516169130005
I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life .	4816.582852268252
Others of the party were now applied to .	10178.436969860899
I will leave him to himself .	6282.531550309453
How good it was in you , my dear Bennet !	7200.367005287026
in half a minute the letter was unfolded again , and collecting herself as well as she could , she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham , and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence .	4391.583529725012
When the engagement was for home , some of the officers always made part of it , of which officers Wickham was sure to be one ;	4762.731884946751
till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante .	6178.648049959743
E6 .	29757.454875608575
Bennet invited him to dine with them ;	8571.485715523355
You need not distress yourself .	8033.48884741572
and he was more communicative , and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him .	4721.651475406435
What do you mean , Bennet , by talking in this way ?	5382.492674103646
A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features , but he said not a word , and Elizabeth , though blaming herself for her own weakness , could not go on .	4738.139139519246
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement , the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law .	4432.244414722318
In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name ;	7409.400761143799
Elizabeth took up some needlework , and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion .	5150.772037424084
His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive ;	6159.930019651336
With great energy ;	13581.224782211164
there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day .	7260.737587069959
Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ;	5797.125111781526
She is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and I have no opinion of her .	4516.939192080162
Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit , and threw back the praise on her sister's warm affection .	5317.57522014987
My visit was not long , as Caroline and Hurst were going out .	6271.43383135477
They will never be distressed for money .	7510.033160182779
for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial .	5829.326092847015
True .	23252.575187015314
your feelings , I know , will bestow it unwillingly , but I demand it of your justice .	6324.334745218482
I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one ;	5516.276659979604
My dear Jane , Collins is a conceited , pompous , narrow-minded , silly man ;	4963.811909195136
If he does not come to me , then , said she , I shall give him up for ever .	4604.2677267387635
I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his ill-treatment ;	4992.180031223289
Well , now let us be quite comfortable and snug , and talk and laugh all the way home .	5113.933311556046
and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world .	4278.944594403745

Sir William had been delighted with him .	8189.59322734745
and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair .	5877.255831144803
said Gardiner .	16602.839986649466
The business was therefore soon settled .	7926.033265046216
and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated , I felt no doubt of their happiness together .	4368.296557046791
and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings .	5976.440283860336
but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention .	5949.419460425041
She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there , and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you .	4828.295957912136
that I had been with you , you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone .	6027.615961137013
but , with many expressions of concern , he confessed himself engaged elsewhere .	5333.219393989355
Wickham had received his commission before he left London , and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight .	5096.381348718298
I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn .	4374.181241088629
My objections to the marriage were not merely those , which I last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside , in my own case ;	4710.015839773065
Sure he will not leave London before he has found them .	8422.884624479988
Her aunt assured her that she was ;	7928.851285782608
How it could occur a second time therefore was very odd !	6898.9545302259385
it was evident that he was very much in love with her .	5482.686625007872
I know we dine with four and twenty families .	5601.050590163987
He still loves me , and we are engaged .	6974.955170522214
and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers .	4884.455181601955
Bingley of course returned with him to dinner ;	8282.660788317457
Its completion depended on others .	12342.318502566179
It pains me to offend you .	8259.944069357607
And if I had not a letter to write myself , I might sit by you , and admire the evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did .	4621.587673853666
though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible , I instantly resolved on setting off for this place , that I might make my sentiments known to you .	4569.233154519263
His apparent partiality had subsided , his attentions were over , he was the admirer of some one else .	5522.071189810513
but for your sakes , we would do any thing .	6413.654626862632
This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife ;	5066.851348473413
I who knew what he was .	7640.735496563357
All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes .	7848.760118101239
There I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it ;	6905.720720047164
That will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable ;	6889.3756125881255
Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ;	8901.060544562486
He did every thing best in the world ;	6218.824338920148
Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these , what would have been her sensations ?	5065.013908271226
Bennet and Kitty walked off , and as soon as they were gone Collins began .	5214.710787300684
Not that I have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body .	5805.234574052152
Miss Bingley told me , said Jane , that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance .	5187.247292530036
she was dying to know what could be his meaning and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him ?	5460.398948874683
I wish I might take this for a compliment ;	5330.596305578749
My father and Maria are to come to me in March , added Charlotte , and I hope you will consent to be of the party .	4343.541753944627
I saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it ;	5071.32498611331
We were always good friends ;	8984.396012911782
The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature , must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance ;	4800.106371799591
This was praise , of all others most extraordinary , most opposite to her ideas .	5612.342967319431
The Gardiners staid only one night at Longbourn , and set off the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement .	4825.549962956491
She was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia , and , removed from the influence of Lydia's example , she became , by proper attention and management , less irritable , less ignorant , and less insipid .	3984.3842191222243
My dear father , I congratulate you .	6718.883281825491
and turning round , he looked for a moment at Elizabeth , till catching her eye , he withdrew his own and coldly said , She is tolerable ;	4584.509138693351
He does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from Darcy more than once , but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only .	4547.053599904126
He made her an offer in this very room , and she refused him .	5663.076154526503
Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase , and listened with all her heart ;	5577.341626790217
It was some time , however , before a smile could be extorted from Jane .	4713.349397184265
Sometimes one officer , sometimes another had been her favourite , as their attentions raised them in her opinion .	6175.077552967053
and , therefore , abruptly changing the conversation , talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage .	4407.774542111803
My uncle and aunt and I were to go together ;	6827.946698170349

for on first hearing it , Bennet sat quite still , and unable to utter a syllable .	5573.855107645167
I never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter .	4292.797264293811

for Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law , that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion .	4328.256884554438
] PRIDE AND PREJUDICE : A Novel .	8657.525160623883
You will not , I hope , consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family , my dear Madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter's favour , without having paid yourself and Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf .	3977.006348104398
I have been used to consider poetry as the food of love , said Darcy .	4410.772029921938
She had never heard of his having had any relations , except a father and mother , both of whom had been dead many years .	4152.100393815818
Or in other words , you are determined to have him .	8422.955776328197
and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again , when Bingley , who as well as the other had sat down , suddenly rose , and whispering a few words to her sister , ran out of the room .	3672.9099882848946
and secondly , of my room .	7593.196789604626

A little .	13968.005498702467
On the contrary , there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks .	5689.7554382361295
and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly , and live in so rational a manner , as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten .	4225.641461285571
and I should be miserable to forfeit it .	5339.375767671025

It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected .	3808.635044070389
and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day .	4732.99494410689
Well , all I know is , that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him .	5039.028388471821
And what claims has Lydia , what attractions has she beyond youth , health , and good humour , that could make him for her sake , forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well ?	4323.356122126978
May I ask to what these questions tend ?	9331.696698711352
They walked on , without knowing in what direction .	7293.174137247628
CHAPTER VII .	11746.06741553873
It was a fortnight since Bennet had been down stairs , but on this happy day , she again took her seat at the head of her table , and in spirits oppressively high .	3951.311045869045
She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on which there could be no difference of sentiment .	4705.300849779342
then some time or other we shall be happy to hear you .	7840.948029716366
causes which , though still existing , and existing to an equal degree in both instances , I had myself endeavoured to forget , because they were not immediately before me .	5224.685230071366
And can you likewise declare , that there is no foundation for it ?	6174.555252557984
I knew it myself , as it was known to Miss Bingley , but her brother is even yet ignorant of it .	4554.823728223032
As long as she stays there , it is all very well .	6723.957524388435
No arguments shall be wanting on my part , that can alleviate so severe a misfortune ;	5873.781412741521
No I cannot talk of books in a ball-room ;	7497.519442848873
I mention it , because it is the living which I ought to have had .	5455.645517505931
I write without any intention of paining you , or humbling myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , cannot be too soon forgotten ;	4395.101306303097
and her calling here was prodigiously civil !	6157.77765293371
She danced next with an officer , and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham , and of hearing that he was universally liked .	4815.735008388029
A thorough , determined dislike of me a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy .	5583.163802035928
Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister , who joined her with a cheerful look , which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors , than Elizabeth .	4596.698058285548
Which do you mean ?	14586.679524877394
Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in Section 4 , Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation .	3747.8873903061412
But before she had been three minutes in her own room , her mother followed her .	5240.874582292513
And when you have given your ball , she added , I shall insist on their giving one also .	4929.063381865917
If you received the work on a physical medium , you must return the medium with your written explanation .	4984.201003855522
We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us , said Gardiner , but perhaps to the Lakes .	5004.751899635511
But the case is this .	7408.036009944366
1 .	12212.55279990698
I believe her to be both in a great degree , replied Wickham ;	5284.547570134427
I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow , in comparison with myself , I should not pay him half so much deference .	4184.963937588767
And do you really love him quite well enough ?	6289.815093157273
He has heartily forgiven me now .	7057.041271861085
Yes , indeed , cried Bennet , offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood .	5164.28274503532
My aunt told me so herself on Saturday .	7248.394027397506
As it principally concerns yourself , you ought to know its contents .	6470.0554375982765
You are not going to introduce yourself to Darcy ?	5362.971193640609
Something very much to the purpose of course .	10178.436969860899
The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family .	5148.210995758037
She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither ;	5244.148238536193
I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place .	3979.89591728629
but he saw only the father .	6958.816478820458
It would be dreadful !	7725.890532532089
Everything wore a happier aspect .	13637.93872720995
their minds were more vacant than their sisters' , and when nothing better offered , a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening ;	5075.754648964529
I told you so from the first , you may remember .	5550.477298667125
The gentlemen did approach ;	9078.7519639472
They had not been long together , before Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her ;	4918.450373368418
But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was .	5541.088599178744
and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another , might be remarked , he meant to make enquiries at Clapham .	4223.1097499091875
Were it known to the rest of my family , I should not have merely my own gratitude to express .	5831.7118000156215
If it was to be secret , said Jane , say not another word on the subject .	5041.444451424802
The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn ;	7211.596175004608
and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying there too .	4281.657512848547
she could not but say , after a moment's deliberation , I am not .	6377.778715576856
and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her , she dared not pronounce .	4793.126664384552
and what is to divide them ?	7167.280699941238
The two youngest of the family , Catherine and Lydia , were particularly frequent in these attentions ;	5189.400112034575
I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least .	4602.790046806135
I London : Printed for T Egerton , Military Library , Whitehall .	4800.993645028019
for , what with her board and pocket allowance , and the continual presents in money , which passed to her , through her mother's hands , Lydia's expences had been very little within that sum .	4445.393474596771
Dearest Lizzy , I hardly know what I would write , but I have bad news for you , and it cannot be delayed .	5590.701591118561
It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ;	4490.445250677896
No , not at all .	8341.893261188226
You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking , and thinking for your approbation alone .	5171.103620057451
Come as soon as you can on the receipt of this .	7580.891161898959
he introduced us to his sister .	9053.39939600845
Aye because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield , and he could not help answering her ;	6075.8039726572815
Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth : My dearest Lizzy , I FIND myself very unwell this morning , which , I suppose , is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday .	4691.456804386409
and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome , discontented or too poor , she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences , silence their complaints , and scold them into harmony and plenty .	4247.7946598898525
but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear .	5277.938940262603
Lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how much he will give her .	5381.545621303138
Elizabeth was delighted .	8246.069810935844
The wish of procuring her regard , which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire , could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this .	4669.89933148303
But it is always so .	6569.889733720828
I did not know before , that I had two daughters on the brink of matrimony .	4188.720821313861
And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment .	4592.485757424814
but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled , and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with .	4285.502684631836
But so we all do .	8402.041456876663
May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment , or are the result of previous study ?	5699.880289025822
But he is , beyond all comparison , the most agreeable man I ever saw and if he becomes really attached to me I believe it will be better that he should not .	4276.198049534406
how shall I bear so much happiness !	9572.858094465937
She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia , with anxious parade , walk up to her mother's right hand , and hear her say to her eldest sister , Ah !	4346.69509741371
They were natural and just .	7645.22525829039
Denny and Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Philips's house , and then made their bows , in spite of Miss Lydia's pressing entreaties that they would come in , and even in spite of Philips' throwing up the parlour window , and loudly seconding the invitation .	4499.040723870604
and if she accepted any refreshment , seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family .	4132.925856585065
He did not talk to me of his own arts , said Fitzwilliam smiling .	5225.474377675772
Pray do not talk of that odious man .	8755.170747524284
It is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half-hour's acquaintance , as to a real , strong attachment .	4491.926335976881
F 1 .	22757.11010138367
every body had been most kind and attentive to him , there had been no formality , no stiffness , he had soon felt acquainted with all the room ;	5149.206298736495
Let me first see how he behaves , said she ;	6837.969375514691
and I should have gone so all the way , if Kitty had not been sick ;	4570.432397087602
but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time , she had the same story to repeat every day .	4885.849076316184
Your daughter Elizabeth , it is presumed , will not long bear the name of Bennet , after her elder sister has resigned it , and the chosen partner of her fate , may be reasonably looked up to , as one of the most illustrious personages in this land .	4326.058892993357
I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this , and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time , without being informed that she was very accomplished .	4176.476332924498
On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared ;	5956.6731031546815
72 of La Belle Assemblee 1 st July 1815 ] PRIDE PREJUDICE .	7840.8854740350325
In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty , who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments , to make their appearance before .	4598.345440212364
Lakes , mountains , and rivers , shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations ;	7118.347151727821
But surely , said she , I may enter his county with impunity , and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me .	4590.462179000489
He took the hint , and when Mary had finished her second song , said aloud , That will do extremely well , child .	4561.9783039436425
and when we got to the George , I do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too .	3932.843450178736
Do not you , Darcy ?	8291.261566368363
The garden in which stands my humble abode , is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park , her ladyship's residence .	4953.252497282302
I shall go distracted .	7037.107981624873
If you were aware , said Elizabeth , of the very great disadvantage to us all , which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded and imprudent manner ;	4416.985728633474
Elizabeth was disgusted , and even Miss Bennet was shocked .	5654.728282817089
You both did as much as you could , in planning the marriage .	6076.984878043879
And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate ;	5104.174313175703
There's for you !	18472.368653312184
my dear , continued Bennet , I am quite delighted with him .	6142.573907630958
Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding ;	5950.400774387954
Elizabeth made no objection ;	8058.799268349236
did you admire me for my impertinence ?	10714.69959417815
The officers may not be so pleasant in General 's regiment .	6222.636253772926
By this time , my dearest sister , you have received my hurried letter ;	6385.470632098591
But not before they went to Brighton ?	7337.032582118217
When that business was over , he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for the indulgence of some music .	5566.161748024626
How much of good or evil must be done by him !	6315.111543781497
only in different lines .	14586.679524877369
Elizabeth , who had a letter to write , went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea ;	4662.8964967941265
I think she will .	6953.81239836588
It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane , said she .	5394.647001786332
Miss Bingley offered her the carriage , and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it , when Jane testified such concern in parting with her , that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present .	4079.5197792548947
Did Darcy give you his reasons for this interference ?	8409.78539583371
her uncle and aunt stopped also , and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building , the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road , which led behind it to the stables .	4696.366644881395
She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others ;	6171.622932144018
I cannot make him out .	6601.002059916849
Then , observed Elizabeth , you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman .	5638.512139645783
but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me , was a strong inducement .	4767.666024999565
She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her , but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea ;	4391.180105836641
and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society , and from our connection with Rosings , the frequent means of varying the humble home scene , I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome .	4140.234544940801
and he might imagine , from my father's behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that he would do as little , and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter .	3879.031804376666
The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage , explained to her that , by his wife at least , if not by himself , such a hope was cherished .	4531.237105620546
It ought to be so ;	7710.49632515713
Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane .	8086.499086453188
that proud and repulsive as were his manners , she had never , in the whole course of their acquaintance , an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together , and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways , seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits .	4156.0379090399665
Do you talk by rule then , while you are dancing ?	6411.534589348087
Oh , lord !	8412.633737715443
But , alas !	8077.001117556847
Your ladyship wants Darcy to marry your daughter ;	8062.427811453233
CHAPTER IX .	11746.06741553873
but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way .	6336.537710604967
It may do very well for the others , replied Bingley ;	6150.69759343297
and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke , joined to the circumstance itself , and many of the circumstances of the preceding day , opened to them a new idea on the business .	4091.640169238376
or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ?	6808.609893857516
Had I been in love , I could not have been more wretchedly blind .	6386.111599405657
But still he would be her husband .	7569.394349723822
He had found the law a most unprofitable study , and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained , if I would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for , and I could not have forgotten my revered father's intentions .	3925.983935344149
I must have my share in the conversation , if you are speaking of music .	4878.066922473426
but her sister's was involved in it , as she thought he must be sensible himself .	5304.748647362852
They shook hands with great cordiality ;	8774.131301208306
Do not charge a fee for access to , viewing , displaying , performing , copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works unless you comply with paragraph 1 .	4593.959595348689
and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance , of his having ten thousand a year .	4346.840973828395
There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer ;	5448.890199043432
and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him , as now , when all love must be vain .	4609.962752131593
Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants .	5676.828603091587
The marriage of a daughter , which had been the first object of her wishes , since Jane was sixteen , was now on the point of accomplishment , and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials , fine muslins , new carriages , and servants .	4156.5603893260095
nor could she think , without a smile , of what her ladyship's indignation would have been .	5899.557020448267
and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out .	4294.455608534335
Every thing being settled between them , Darcy's next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in Gracechurch-street the evening before I came home .	4796.400028626607
In as short a time as Collins's long speeches would allow , every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both ;	5145.531043343549
But do not be cast down .	6955.91500847032
I was so vexed to see him stand up with her ;	5129.332916655516
She is grown so brown and coarse !	6235.405864089816
I am very , very sorry .	4954.581410128493
He now wished it more than ever .	7523.634045102209
and in farther justification of Darcy , she could not but allow that Bingley , when questioned by Jane , had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair ;	4259.633501836199
The time fixed for the beginning of their Northern tour was now fast approaching ;	5820.290441830737
But what , said she , after a pause , can have been his motive ?	5242.7649467487645
they are married !	14304.537660892775
cried Elizabeth , I am excessively diverted .	7227.678063241033
Could there be finer symptoms ?	11896.123119353897
The possibility of his having really endured such unkindness , was enough to interest all her tender feelings ;	5042.812744407482
he was moving that way ;	10077.374588780109
but with a moment's recollection and a returning smile , replied , that he had formerly seen him often ;	5088.688546992658
And what am I to do on the occasion ?	6384.3885565405035
You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns , said Darcy in a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour .	4945.37294195225
I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction , and nobody but a governess can give it .	4615.4130388588455
Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth .	7127.80168117022
I expected you to stay two months .	6819.213190869561
Well , but now for my news : it is about dear Wickham ;	5774.066177451725
It was a journey of only twenty-four miles , and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch-street by noon .	4171.613677105383
They have both , said she , been deceived , I dare say , in some way or other , of which we can form no idea .	4594.343180733403
Nor was her respect for him , though it made her more quiet , at all likely to make her more elegant .	5610.701081816762
she cried .	10962.818898217341
Collins moreover adds , I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad business has been so well hushed up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place , should be so generally known .	4529.670897837277
and , as he spoke , he left the room , fatigued with the raptures of his wife .	4282.293760744478
He cannot afford it .	9480.386475234485
and after relating the circumstances , she thus went on : I am now convinced , my dear aunt , that I have never been much in love ;	4095.6050008634234
I knew that Wickham ought not to be a clergyman .	5714.86741626991
And they are really to be married !	7796.496820654397
A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other , and out of their three months' acquaintance they had been intimate two .	4878.468499531884
Your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as I said before , they had a great deal of talk together .	5087.348581586487
a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure and affection and intelligence , which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad .	5016.67361857053
Elizabeth went away with her head full of him .	7052.643594338891
and she was perpetually either making some inquiry , or looking at his page .	4356.158656703802
But the horror of what might possibly happen , almost took from me my faculties .	5170.621627999804
At any rate , she cannot grow many degrees worse , without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life .	4976.403266146022
Can you deny that you have done it ?	8524.219021383033
Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother's .	7052.643594338891
You could not have started a more happy idea , since you will not take comfort in mine .	4975.536267713701
No more have I , said Bennet ;	8252.124211044935
Jane was by no means better .	8350.979046763878
Why , at that rate , you will have been here only six weeks .	6192.824299935158
I had not an idea of it .	5798.100744482844
I never saw such a woman .	6098.326300874892
Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid , who continued , though slowly , to mend ;	5195.270684302394
In nine cases out of ten , a woman had better shew more affection than she feels .	5697.578601390227
Elizabeth would wonder , and probably would blame her ;	6864.622790699386
The present unhappy state of the family , rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary ;	5167.468348124982
Darcy took her place by her niece , and they walked on together .	6054.039736249142
But from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed , respecting each circumstance , I shall hope to be in future secured , when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read .	4278.748092384909
and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning .	4995.256664414633
but shortly recovering himself , advanced towards the party , and spoke to Elizabeth , if not in terms of perfect composure , at least of perfect civility .	4696.87726468035
I know it all ;	6628.732846139425
La !	22111.518280636905
I know of nobody that is coming I am sure , unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in , and I hope my dinners are good enough for her .	4244.636661967767
You must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm works .	4100.939528353203
Elizabeth could not but be pleased , could not but triumph .	5067.206576067401
In spite of this amendment , however , she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn , desiring her mother to visit Jane , and form her own judgment of her situation .	4441.575722069499
is not this an agreeable surprise ?	11106.801923151577
He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be , and unconsciously closed his book .	4437.83144881405
But we considered it , we talked of it as impossible .	5974.534902188805
I can hardly write for laughing .	6581.746745714497
Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment , before their approach was announced by the door-bell , and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room .	4382.782439048259
Her aunt now called her to look at a picture .	6794.940343366923
CHAPTER XI .	13083.650239159624
Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Bennet .	7400.109143036231
Come be quick , be quick !	11106.934745442433
She could neither wonder nor condemn , but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom , afforded no palliation of her distress .	4497.443146284053
Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh , said Elizabeth .	6658.852567885004
Five daughters successively entered the world , but yet the son was to come ;	6983.338505639886
I do not know when I have been more shocked , said she .	3648.085377613077
Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object .	8747.585921543756
I know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you ;	4747.252496774137
Your attendance upon her , has been too much for you .	7119.700997542955
I am sick of Bingley , cried his wife .	5019.004555079891
How can you be so silly , cried her mother , as to think of such a thing , in all this dirt !	4669.703618400356
That is a failing indeed !	7607.733701158892
The Foundation makes no representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United States .	5026.105949070496
but that Charlotte could encourage him , seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself , and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum , and she could not help crying out , Engaged to Collins !	4046.6463972526817
Had they been only ten minutes sooner , they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination , for it was plain that he was that moment arrived , that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage .	4529.862668601434
Do not be afraid of my running into any excess , of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will .	5086.7950326061755
Certainly , Sir ;	14882.342733784842
Elizabeth , feeling really anxious , was determined to go to her , though the carriage was not to be had ;	4662.219993883788
or in other words , to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more .	6166.7324416911215
I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that .	4367.960317612748
Sir William only smiled .	11023.36022813691
and his son will be just like him just as affable to the poor .	5156.114423047797
She seems a very pleasant young woman , said Bingley .	6236.389647597466
but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature , as the compliment deserved .	4523.7258608027205
but I am an idle fellow , and though I have not many , I have more than I ever look into .	4383.043066822756
Now I am quite happy , said she , for you will be as happy as myself .	6050.01854649624
but amongst other causes of disquiet , she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour ;	4945.7298035500635
It was a large , handsome , stone building , standing well on rising ground , and backed by a ridge of high woody hills ;	3993.419618612792
she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion , five and twenty years ago .	5790.465382721105
it was a better sized room , and had a pleasanter aspect ;	5960.123979707198
Do not you know that Collins wants to marry Lizzy ?	6321.988091666677
You are uniformly charming !	7736.086229944065
org Section 4 .	18472.368653312184
Elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them .	4261.456669520281
We have reason to imagine that his aunt , lady Catherine de Bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye .	4899.036084768618
For what do we live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ?	5587.0343717158885
but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley .	6660.670222438117
Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display ;	8422.955776328197
When I have a house of my own , I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library .	5240.632891856048
But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away ;	5850.902628924307
but respecting his abilities , and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself , she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook , and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which , in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children , was so highly reprehensible .	4102.798610179863
She read , with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension , and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes .	4244.947227634205
To Gardiner , Wickham had one means of affording pleasure , unconnected with his general powers .	5965.5525724093095
It is not of peculiar , but of general evils , which I am now complaining .	4387.721324004838
and I am happy to say , there will be some little money , even when all his debts are discharged , to settle on my niece , in addition to her own fortune .	3914.577216585859
This is the consequence you see , Madam , of marrying a daughter , said Elizabeth .	5007.366663824716
and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday , could have made such a Friday , Saturday , Sunday and Monday , endurable to Kitty and Lydia .	4510.765167268457
On reaching the house , they were shewn through the hall into the saloon , whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer .	5306.1216740792315
Wickham only shook his head .	11015.923983907922
where else can they be so well concealed ?	9533.8906793828
This roused a general astonishment ;	10113.896595488373
said she .	12171.146619643097
and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be as well to be silent .	4622.903801110719
But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you , who is very pretty , and I dare say , very agreeable .	4447.947796877609
but when questioned by him Denny denied knowing any thing of their plan , and would not give his real opinion about it .	4695.9916487876035
When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure , she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment .	5376.012992247649
He must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to live on .	4928.161965652334
and that his character was by no means so faulty , nor Wickham's so amiable , as they had been considered in Hertfordshire .	4408.287135076274
Till I have your disposition , your goodness , I never can have your happiness .	6488.647998470657
I do not like to boast of my own child , but to be sure , Jane one does not often see any body better looking .	3934.2536329924446
and when they next met , he looked at her only to criticise .	4928.482194594369
Were it for nothing but his love of you , I must always have esteemed him ;	6404.723362594135
his formal civility was just what it had been , and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family .	5048.336995871769
and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents .	5617.233598292425
but , alas !	8566.291304032186
This invaluable friend was a very young woman , and very lately married .	6455.210026439524
Of whom does Jane ever think ill ?	9518.54716351531
The faces of both , however , were tolerably calm ;	6618.189855879989
I am only ashamed of his asking so little .	4792.354359406173
F3 .	26108.01995875992
Your uncle !	15921.868411023786
but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme .	7056.200160683738
I never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses .	4486.31240766529
I told my sister Philips so the other day .	6068.340710802393
It is useless to talk of it .	5910.328749119172
If we thought alike of Miss Bingley , replied Jane , your representation of all this , might make me quite easy .	5132.083862945614
and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give the praise where it was due .	4068.907040287167
Did not you ?	15140.164344500212
It must be an amusing study .	6752.009083454888
and after a short silence Bennet began repeating her thanks to Bingley for his kindness to Jane , with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy .	4390.381828451559
He is the kind of man , indeed , to whom I should never dare refuse any thing , which he condescended to ask .	4502.965678814203
that abominable Darcy !	14156.330524659112
What an excellent father you have , girls , said she , when the door was shut .	5368.523903930766
Does she live near you , sir ?	10302.065429185526
I see no occasion for that .	6741.118612022062
Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty , but she smiled too much .	5944.575004219089
She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable .	4938.380862691414
but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood , and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess .	4293.364904710464
and when he did speak , it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety , not a pleasure to himself .	4333.991574379005
but on the third , her repining was over , and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once , on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere .	4300.335678228431
and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds .	4438.816589125539
Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you , and wants him to marry Miss Darcy .	5022.9805092208235
and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice .	4164.161313892986
With them he is remarkably agreeable .	9663.752593329391
I never met with anybody who delighted me so much .	5535.491305575367
CHAPTER VII .	11746.06741553873
Why must their marriage be private ?	9756.088946984573
I speak nothing but the truth .	7386.9658524529195
The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart ;	6162.242380864301
If Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin , why is not he to make another choice ?	5285.01042155738
Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight , when she should enter the room .	7621.616776307488
In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society .	5751.808468595169
cried Elizabeth .	9945.194991360355
and what with the Philipses , the Lucases , and the officers , there was not a day without its engagement .	4727.441800715125
I am sorry you think so ;	4852.013300634179
There are a few things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works even without complying with the full terms of this agreement .	4704.357057186637
On that head , therefore , I shall be uniformly silent ;	7144.568010441402
and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust , naturally inclined my father to be of service to him , and on George Wickham , who was his god-son , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed .	4306.56073801623
You persist , then , in supposing his sisters influence him .	6488.413725397048
The surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great ;	4879.34562538106
Ten thousand a year , and very likely more !	7967.207055441818
It was first broken by Annesley , a genteel , agreeable-looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse , proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others ;	4065.8460064298442
Lady Catherine observed , after dinner , that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits , and immediately accounting for it herself , by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon , she added , But if that is the case , you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer .	4015.3624465621024
His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention , the first to listen and to pity , the first to be admired ;	4612.366140980887
I cannot but wonder , however , at her having any such fears now , because , if he had at all cared about me , we must have met long , long ago .	4151.271588039971
What will Wickham say ?	10111.589505007983
Elizabeth , though she did not credit above half of what was said , believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister's ruin still more certain ;	4442.764314461222
And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice ?	7193.667351437841
Another time , Lizzy , said her mother , I would not dance with him , if I were you .	5675.551677145773
She had ventured only one glance at Darcy .	5893.478651937946
My dear Lizzy , they must have passed within ten miles of us .	4957.477802278962
His affection for her soon sunk into indifference ;	7707.723797180081
but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty .	4967.444483922664
Kitty simpered and smiled , and hoped her turn was coming soon .	7260.25641640399
and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another , and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be .	4029.4942580323136
What did Colonel Forster say ?	9974.31450364193
and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths , quite mistake the matter .	5141.5673313697325
But to expose the former faults of any person , without knowing what their present feelings were , seemed unjustifiable .	4921.244469519943
Not so much as I could wish , Sir ;	7702.069539319129
Both sisters were uncomfortable enough .	12805.416551947083
she cried .	10962.818898217341
Pray do , my dear Miss Lucas , she added in a melancholy tone , for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me , I am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves .	4596.886628463235
With no expectation of pleasure , but with the strongest curiosity , Elizabeth opened the letter , and to her still increasing wonder , perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper , written quite through , in a very close hand .	4433.614787664581
Ever since I have known it , I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it .	6072.376973895545
Nobody can tell what I suffer !	11766.965116428715
Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister ;	5904.68185124924
Very much .	18193.912977931544
I do not deserve it .	4968.199373103759
Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman , and he was thinking of her with some complacency , when thus accosted by Miss Bingley , I can guess the subject of your reverie .	4596.778502837901
He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room .	4810.918047553097
On finding Bennet , Elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words , May I hope , Madam , for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth , when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ?	4175.61783265904
Kitty and me were to spend the day there , and Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening ;	5598.05529771267
Darcy bowed .	14860.645851626425
but her spirits returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be duped , by the sister at least .	4971.920719099032
Where shall you change horses ?	12548.429564955046
We all love to instruct , though we can teach only what is not worth knowing .	5830.52043452614
They attacked him in various ways ;	8774.131301208306
That he should even speak to her was amazing !	6939.0319166939435
He was struggling for the appearance of composure , and would not open his lips , till he believed himself to have attained it .	4498.23966408284
She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight , and was certain of a willing listener in Jane , whenever she might wish to talk again of either .	4132.33990381939
The tumult of her mind was now painfully great .	6544.292966201631
Oh , yes !	6953.750776902737
and the respect which he felt for her high rank , and his veneration for her as his patroness , mingling with a very good opinion of himself , of his authority as a clergyman , and his rights as a rector , made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness , self-importance and humility .	3848.6215198193845
But , perhaps his sister does as well for the present , and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her .	4248.668442634515
but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to .	5360.191725941793
The first week of their return was soon gone .	6420.100047833834
It mortifies me .	11016.593944765506
Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood ;	6352.071622049007
I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more about it , and to ask when Denny comes back from town .	4518.162917267964
but if that be the case , there can at least be no want of subject .	5304.748647362852
It must have been his sister's doing .	6468.741969801533
and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning .	4316.593602606205
Collins's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter , to whom they could give little fortune ;	6040.563554369104
but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish .	4310.419967946876
and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship's carriage was ready to take them all home .	4583.566035694236
The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent , had made a great difference in the country , and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees .	4562.770661595742
But you are not entitled to know mine ;	6201.608555733692
cried Elizabeth .	9945.194991360355
Jane looked at her doubtingly .	9280.839867249482
E9 .	22111.518280636905
The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished ;	6618.13045543331
Had she found Jane in any apparent danger , Bennet would have been very miserable ;	6055.000786601916
These are home questions and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature .	5761.58563118617
And if not able to please himself in the arrangement , he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice .	5062.122537628649
In the first place , replied Gardiner , there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland .	4393.151606606413
In Three Volumes .	9009.720995690765
More thoughtfulness , and less anxiety to please than when they last met , were plainly expressed .	6689.083955578271
His former acquaintance had been numerous ;	9101.685856896329
There was no one therefore who could be pointed out , as likely to give any news of him .	4941.528859456387
' Allow me , by the way , to observe , my fair cousin , that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer .	4659.735548180653
It has been most unconsciously done , however , and I hope will be of short duration .	4886.091340534538
and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood .	6494.513335156713
Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings , and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them .	5517.133455780268
Other books were produced , and after some deliberation he chose Fordyce's Sermons .	7512.894384124344
He found her as handsome as she had been last year ;	6427.500893000824
and it was certain , that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one , whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his weakest side .	4014.647370612744
Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory .	8025.259395167547
But here he was set right by Bennet , who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook , and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen .	4311.076604725681
Her character will be fixed , and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous .	4970.284659833082
Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole Park , but feared it might be beyond a walk .	5713.447636834103
and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins , the excellence of its cookery was owing .	4626.534225190492
She was now in an irritation as violent from delight , as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation .	4395.50784805453
She was immediately told , that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence ;	4717.3632219297515
Bingley and Jane , however , soon allowed the others to outstrip them .	6129.833173867038
If you do not charge anything for copies of this eBook , complying with the rules is very easy .	4715.422723565099
If you mean Darcy , cried her brother , he may go to bed , if he chuses , before it begins but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing ;	4356.704039272384
No , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems likely to rain ;	4836.267248909408
but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given , to remind her of her post .	4536.6065463708
They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching ;	4309.616014945882
but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went , for neither Lydia nor Collins were once silent .	4649.2713661296675
no .	21743.916583426515
yes I understand you perfectly .	11896.123119353897
On applying to see the place , they were admitted into the hall ;	6483.914573752429
You know how I detest it , unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner .	5313.863905292929
he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it .	4899.799268766907
It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side ;	4550.89245613298
it came from Netherfield , and the servant waited for an answer .	6864.575343397206
Four weeks passed away , and Jane saw nothing of him .	7793.077222544604
but in vain .	9746.405471931721
Darcy replied with great intrepidity , Miss Elizabeth Bennet .	7549.376498952938
The gentleman experienced some change of feeling ;	7675.607661452701
I was obliged to confess one thing , which for a time , and not unjustly , offended him .	4605.192695186295
After many pauses and many trials of other subjects , Elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first , and saying , I am astonished at his intimacy with Bingley !	4806.04145644888
Darcy took up a book ;	9392.700864981154
When she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ;	5605.763392845376
I felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in marriage , because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right .	4505.860297425709
To this speech Bingley made no answer ;	7291.839804169787
A young man , such as you describe Bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks , and when accident separates them , so easily forgets her , that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent .	4430.1421031133395
I hope at least he has not deceived us .	5433.765333157525
and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit .	4700.478361862412
but that it was no worse , she had need to be thankful .	5496.818450935001
but no one was less likely than Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life .	4750.23556581838
You are very ill .	7218.230976227788
Lady Catherine's great attentions to Collins you have been a daily witness of ;	6473.685851235289
Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter , and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again .	4987.72845170231
Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Bennet and the children .	7400.053211685994
Elizabeth was again deep in thought , and after a time exclaimed , To treat in such a manner , the god-son , the friend , the favourite of his father !	4247.243564497058
and she dwelt with energy on his many merits , as they proceeded together up the great staircase .	4505.114968352408
About a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in London ;	5909.728682022126
They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse ;	6241.744945243492
It was reasonable , however , to hope , that they would not continue long .	4713.446079292732
I am exceedingly gratified , said Bingley , by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper .	4180.131229422318
Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed ?	8523.837776034541
So , he enquired who she was , and got introduced , and asked her for the two next .	5909.762590034596
The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed , except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention .	4962.293406197674
Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory ;	5840.563689351042
Not that I shall though , she added to herself , as she finished the letter ;	5414.116952141738
a sense of very great ill usage , and most painful regrets at his being what he is .	6114.359422864249
My motive for cautioning you , is as follows .	6951.146541285182
He acknowledged the truth of it all ;	7762.076903880112
But little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there .	5509.052651443443
one I will not mention ;	12548.429564955046
A scheme of which every part promises delight , can never be successful ;	6481.166854237239
See <FILENAME> or <FILENAME> : ( <URL> ) or ( <URL> ) Images of the original pages are available through Internet Archive .	5867.282501888594
She did not fear her father's opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means , that she , his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her , was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till Darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile .	3844.0804018360113
and after laughing at her some time , allowed her at last to go saying , as she quitted the room , If any young men come for Mary or Kitty , send them in , for I am quite at leisure .	4083.4037729067927
and fearful , on the contrary , as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long , she urged Jane to borrow Bingley's carriage immediately , and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned , and the request made .	4026.6564960103206
She looked at Jane , and smiled , and shook her head by turns .	5018.47486309878
Yes , and her petticoat ;	7462.497816012928
I would go and see her , if I could have the carriage .	5255.443358810082
How was that possible ?	10692.818904125765
It was over at last however .	6118.795497843198
avoiding Bennet as much as possible , saying not much to Elizabeth , and nothing at all to the others .	6040.76363560935
here comes Hill .	18472.368653312184
This was invitation enough .	9489.723298044672
' She did indeed .	14264.996685155862
Lady Catherine listened to half a song , and then talked , as before , to her other nephew ;	5102.229008168932
But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought , and think only of what will make me happy , your affection , and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt .	3967.109287328386
Their powers of conversation were considerable .	9771.421732755569
Miss Bingley , said he , has given me credit for more than can be .	5386.738443304001
We know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode .	6264.7372165134575
At such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth , though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband .	4245.932413458326
To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love ;	6130.293334294668
for who would object to such a partner ?	7925.698721008949
He placed himself by her .	8980.030091838973
You know my mother's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends .	5212.28433923518
Excuse my interference .	17658.907085145383
That she should receive an offer of marriage from Darcy !	6766.792901923779
But Elizabeth had now recollected herself , and making a strong effort for it , was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished her all imaginable happiness .	4148.976538870293
The hall , the dining-room , and all its furniture were examined and praised ;	5820.24865056516
I will sit in my library , in my night cap and powdering gown , and give as much trouble as I can , or , perhaps , I may defer it , till Kitty runs away .	4104.979904721169
But it ended in nothing , and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again .	4947.850790097806
Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over , and , though determined not to slacken as a correspondent , it was for the sake of what had been , rather than what was .	4178.518895126916
There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same , but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh , I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters .	4475.709427287927
She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest , but Jane with all possible mildness declined interfering ;	5222.548283517007
She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte's observation , and hurried her away to her room .	4545.981282713708
But you forget , mama , said Elizabeth , that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that Long has promised to introduce him .	4482.323314180431
Wickham indeed had gone to her , on their first arrival in London , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her .	4695.595570099246
Have you never happened to see her there ?	8360.158082026952
Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane , while she was ill at Netherfield ?	6490.665562497346
Oh !	6826.5207498362
Conjectures as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her brain ;	6890.65334671707
She answered with equal indifference and brevity , and the other said no more .	5410.28206504273
I dislike it very much , he replied ;	6634.293899359447
For herself she was humbled ;	11116.320151180227
It certainly is a most iniquitous affair , said Bennet , and nothing can clear Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn .	4918.708428775882
Why any fear of detection ?	11116.320151180227
Bennet all amazement , though flattered by having a guest of such high importance , received her with the utmost politeness .	5213.459087513064
cried he , with an air of awkward gallantry ;	6765.19109687047
cried Lydia .	14061.602163970252
About a month ago I received this letter , and about a fortnight ago I answered it , for I thought it a case of some delicacy , and requiring early attention .	4878.885928288876
They were within twenty yards of each other , and so abrupt was his appearance , that it was impossible to avoid his sight .	4583.401260393307
When this information was given , and they had all taken their seats , Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire , and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment , that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings ;	4167.263903041495
To Catherine and Lydia , neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting .	5965.630448127971
He listened to her with perfect indifference , while she chose to entertain herself in this manner , and as his composure convinced her that all was safe , her wit flowed long .	4548.172350271537
It is something to think of , and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions .	4695.497756377241
This son was to join in cutting off the entail , as soon as he should be of age , and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for .	4620.781986761269
there is nothing marked in its lines .	8823.787832645292
and in her air altogether , there is a self-sufficiency without fashion , which is intolerable .	4710.686379406345
I do not pretend to regret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire , except your society , my dearest friend ;	3863.881355975404
Her astonishment , as she reflected on what had passed , was increased by every review of it .	5346.32172055941
she times them ill .	11682.816353253438
Darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as Gracechurch Street , but he would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities , were he once to enter it ;	4575.665792435053
CHAPTER XVII .	11746.06741553873
Not yet , replied Jane .	9907.966756399954
but I do not know when that will be .	5310.048181550597
The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucas's last week ;	5679.552929626116
She expressed her gratitude again , but it was too painful a subject to each , to be dwelt on farther .	5068.035050519009
Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical .	7476.082964883988
Here , leading the way through every walk and cross walk , and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for , every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind .	4659.075494024192
Elizabeth could hardly help smiling , as she assured her that had not been the case .	4955.194165309798
though , when the letters were read , Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen .	5314.3781912797485
and you , yourself , when last at Longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man , who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him .	4330.439153370099
and Collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment ;	4523.457369055915
Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount , and Elizabeth silently consented .	5767.583701725946
And what sort of young lady is she ?	6291.856273400659
She was engaged one day as she walked , in re-perusing Jane's last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by Darcy , she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her .	3935.5332242630034
It would have spared her , she thought , one sleepless night out of two .	4896.13468753301
who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself .	4702.646304644232
to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think , than such as did not .	5855.13303475352
But your arts and allurements may , in a moment of infatuation , have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family .	4669.90195865553
This unfortunate affair will , I fear , prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day .	5466.636113938921
It convinced her , that accident only could discover to Bingley her sister's being in town .	5375.600597516761
He had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research ;	4652.756612832617
E9 .	22111.518280636905
I am afraid , Darcy , observed Miss Bingley , in a half whisper , that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes .	3928.136905616809
On this point she was soon satisfied ;	8450.25696169491
He began to wish to know more of her , and as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others .	4701.3819206181715
The compliment to herself and her sister , was not unfelt .	6372.835733900954
You must not blame my aunt .	6460.390916874624
has she any family ?	15012.190929676433
She was very wrong in singling me out as she did ;	5127.5421038395425
Yet , indeed , I am in earnest .	9142.461385905946
I am sure you must feel it so .	4296.1036579977645
You are charmingly group'd , and appear to uncommon advantage .	5734.403035418822
Let us hope for better things .	9132.475994833556
Charlotte's first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness ;	8224.507098888129
give a loose to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you cannot greatly err .	5169.150547123138
it was melancholy to leave her to such society !	6818.426672487443
Bennet , accompanied by her two youngest girls , reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast .	5487.261960570309
always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body !	7674.886508350777
And in the wretched state of his own finances , there was a very powerful motive for secrecy , in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia's relations , for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him , to a very considerable amount .	4243.6028158913
Her heart was divided between concern for her sister , and resentment against all the others .	5662.322078651339
I am sure I know none so handsome ;	4024.3427983722922
Were the whole arrangement complete , my disappointment would be certain .	7981.115952331997
its object was nothing less , than to secure her from any return of Collins's addresses , by engaging them towards herself .	5807.338335586568
Catherine was disconcerted , and made no answer ;	8997.619804130596
Elizabeth was surprised , however , that Wickham should consent to such a scheme , and , had she consulted only her own inclination , any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes .	4077.319343826059
But she is too much like her brother , very , very proud .	5276.588757195038
His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party ;	6196.973869776566
Not yet , however , in spite of her disappointment in her husband , did Bennet give up the point .	5419.474759982131
Colonel Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity , proved that he was generally different , which her own knowledge of him could not have told her ;	5172.699267566904
CHAPTER XVI .	13083.650239159624
We are not on friendly terms , and it always gives me pain to meet him , but I have no reason for avoiding him but what I might proclaim to all the world ;	4486.17251067401
I have not seen her for many years , but I very well remember that I never liked her , and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent .	3976.2314947362597
I am perfectly serious in my refusal .	4879.374936320357
You may well be surprised , Miss Bennet , at such an assertion , after seeing , as you probably might , the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday .	4402.184200661011
But it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations , and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for her , for a woman who had already refused him , as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham .	3903.914953501285
no wonder if they love her better .	9936.584974667936
He could be still amiable , still pleasing , to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town ;	4983.6522657508995
It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long expectations .	4299.259865706045
I perfectly comprehend your feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been .	5077.189898342106
The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits , in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share .	4710.270986362543
From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach , and with many speeches of thankfulness on Collins's side , and as many bows on Sir William's , they departed .	4837.030523254932
The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world , though only a few weeks before , when Lydia had first run away , they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune .	4296.819204104606
The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse , or covering a skreen .	4962.268833333114
Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia ;	8250.601321568973
As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night ;	4592.879497572753
Elizabeth , however , had never been blind to the impropriety of her father's behaviour as a husband .	4835.4652858544005
The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic .	5979.812941986067
Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton .	6836.435606225212
and in their brother's manners there was something better than politeness ;	5273.047847214232
Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight .	7911.819092498403
Yes the late Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift .	5965.5525724093095
Lady Lucas herself has often said so , and envied me Jane's beauty .	6302.051300555994
We will go round the Park every day .	7237.878506240503
What would she have said ?	9613.475668813422
Of Collins and Lizzy .	12870.989799484363
and his civilities were worn out like his information .	5877.255831144803
Three daughters married !	18472.368653312184
but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just ;	5043.354496571258
One does not know what to think .	8797.692296593113
She resolved to give her the information herself , and therefore charged Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner , to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family .	4303.741595617699
I have heard much of your master's fine person , said Gardiner , looking at the picture ;	4384.661707042554
They may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more exceptionable purpose .	5443.83948583349
Elizabeth could not refuse , though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit .	5051.702362299945
But every body is to judge for themselves , and the Lucases are very good sort of girls , I assure you .	4579.8693151947255
And as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses , to buy them , after they are married .	4464.162239522152
I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular , but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish .	4370.092400945349
She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her , must be the work of her brother , and without looking farther , it was satisfactory ;	4545.981282713708
advised her to return to bed , and promised her some draughts .	8019.4483268181275
His regiment is there ;	11030.44237905895
END OF THE SECOND VOLUME .	11588.735729111942
Stay , stay , I will go myself .	10178.436969860899
did not I mention it to you ?	10714.69959417815
Elizabeth privately added , And how much I shall have to conceal .	6130.25343911869
And with these words he hastily left the room , and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house .	4802.308534258988
This match , to which you have the presumption to aspire , can never take place .	5933.969218807684
Exceedingly well .	22757.11010138367
But he paid her not the smallest attention , till her grandfather's death made her mistress of this fortune .	4932.78541577036
and yet there have been things enough happened in the time .	5659.368867412334
Without allowing herself time for consideration , and scarcely knowing what she felt , Elizabeth on finishing this letter , instantly seized the other , and opening it with the utmost impatience , read as follows : it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first .	4446.336320595845
The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire , lest she should suffer from the change of room ;	4891.244781308271
I am glad it occurred to me to mention it ;	4580.122619440989
but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us , for she went up stairs half an hour ago .	4467.843074755891
CHAPTER XIII .	11746.06741553873
An easy distance do you call it ?	9936.584974667936
Lizzy , cried her mother , remember where you are , and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home .	4784.678311999774
and , to imitate his politeness , she began , as they met , to admire the beauty of the place ;	4358.636767460117
Then taking the disengaged arm of Darcy , she left Elizabeth to walk by herself .	6536.676490402716
But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general .	4574.784525359456
Nothing child , nothing .	12782.678022054408
It was possible , however , that some of his companions in the shire , might be able to give more information ;	4306.906440330479
Well , cried Elizabeth , have it as you choose .	6348.720121921221
but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him , her anger was turned against herself ;	4926.21745603053
Had it been your uncle's doing , I must and would have paid him ;	6516.525850999323
She assured him that no one intended to play , and the silence of the whole party on the subject , seemed to justify her .	4828.474822103923
She was shewn into the breakfast-parlour , where all but Jane were assembled , and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise .	4394.702851835072
and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away .	4759.396640213272
The observations of her uncle and aunt now began ;	6596.513444460306
Elizabeth made no answer ;	6861.270130049677
I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home , and see if I can make it up any better .	4437.760936089916
He must be an oddity , I think , said she .	5847.154969256166
How can you talk so ?	8513.166970010956
Has she been presented ?	14007.472693289528
There were some very strong objections against the lady , were Colonel Fitzwilliam's words , and these strong objections probably were , her having one uncle who was a country attorney , and another who was in business in London .	4264.262385360878
I shall see her again !	5910.197429727976
But her mind was so busily engaged , that she did not always know when she was silent .	5065.277590291661
though often standing within a very short distance of her , quite disengaged , he never came near enough to speak .	5566.3921761070305
Yes , there was something in that ;	6999.86353848315
After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ;	4932.621161039259
Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention .	8504.04700085033
It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match .	4263.130278920123
Beyond a doubt , they do wish him to chuse Miss Darcy , replied Jane ;	7118.298473943141
But of course she did not mention my name to you .	5974.48443306469
But as no such delicacy restrained her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back , she should think herself very ill used .	4101.734753672653
Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts ;	6341.184352567721
If he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to Long .	5305.652360053847
' Those were your words .	12548.429564955046
It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life .	5270.6907928816245
Her nose wants character ;	10877.465746757922
but depend upon it I will carry my point .	6328.843094351166
Gratitude , not merely for having once loved her , but for loving her still well enough , to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him , and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection .	4825.829181713002
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again , having still a great deal to say to her , and many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends .	4791.29434281409
Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves .	9518.54716351531
and in your heart , you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you .	4872.139872419018
Oh !	6826.5207498362
Yes , and I had heard it before .	6156.889532802978
As he said this , she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer .	5490.287380293255
Her colour changed , and she said no more .	7242.294502746367
Such formidable accounts of her Ladyship , and her manner of living , quite frightened Maria Lucas , who had been little used to company , and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings , with as much apprehension , as her father had done to his presentation at James's .	4348.2272456452065
When they had gained their own room , Jane taking out the letter , said , This is from Caroline Bingley ;	5161.739461048749
Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest , and then , sick of this folly , took refuge in her own room , that she might think with freedom .	4657.358978215172
The rector of a parish has much to do .	6907.696563388866
You forced me into visiting him last year , and promised if I went to see him , he should marry one of my daughters .	4898.205497649116
She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors , she wanted to compose her own , and to make herself agreeable to all ;	4659.612704733138
Pardon me for interrupting you , Madam , cried Collins ;	8249.813557801957
;	42550.10940375477
Society has claims on us all ;	11766.965116428715
They were rather handsome , had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town , had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds , were in the habit of spending more than they ought , and of associating with people of rank ;	4105.956085252213
and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn .	5526.171500474475
After this day , Jane said no more of her indifference .	6988.523908488237
and now we are better .	7499.84714362742
Your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you .	6603.23845761726
There is some sense in what he says about the girls however ;	5805.3635382946
and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself .	5369.319013089082
Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me .	6892.365818171726
Lady Catherine herself says that in point of true beauty , Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex ;	4840.21090463858
thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together ;	8422.884624479988
Had I but explained some part of it only some part of what I learnt , to my own family !	5551.640304537536
Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue ;	6841.356584528218
I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love !	5317.408744693979
when we met at Pemberley .	11896.123119353897
My temper would perhaps be called resentful .	7976.191945291854
You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world .	4481.324867754737
I did not know that you intended to walk , said Miss Bingley , in some confusion , lest they had been overheard .	4005.9721875416694
It was all over before I arrived ;	5679.195622425851
cried Elizabeth , as soon as they were by themselves .	5357.779189516893
Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in .	7423.178904064192
wished his fair cousins health and happiness again , and promised their father another letter of thanks .	6689.083955578271
This was spoken jestingly , but it appeared to her so just a picture of Darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer ;	4762.860116263517
Miss Bingley , however , was incapable of disappointing Darcy in any thing , and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives .	4678.962223130843
Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded ;	5037.999134143923
He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins , from a conviction that if they saw him depart , they could not fail to conjecture his design , and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise ;	3994.2924149946234
and she could not help remembering what Charlotte's opinion had always been .	4618.98914627009
CHAPTER XIV .	11746.06741553873
Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable .	7119.700997542955
In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended ;	6101.8231447929
Well , then , you need not be under any alarm .	5983.7850171601785
I think she will be pleased with the hermitage .	5521.674223190918
Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error , and seek to clear one , without involving the other .	5516.429156676126
If they believed him attached to me , they would not try to part us ;	5840.68234829147
but he eluded the skill of them all ;	6123.431913537946
Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me .	8901.060544562486
And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen .	4442.459683208765
She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman ;	5022.821478734139
I am all astonishment .	6026.021993879176
The conversation soon turned upon fishing , and she heard Darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport .	4058.820069581494
Dearest Jane !	21632.83805867054
The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy ;	6222.583688844193
And accordingly she did turn , and they walked towards the Parsonage together .	6174.461936222391
and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September , than any body else in the country .	3907.287737940045
I will make no promise of the kind .	5495.6289779302615
But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was .	5309.7527257162155
Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine , what is to befall her ?	6555.2623701631555
I have been a selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle .	4245.47760854595
My dearest child , she cried , I can think of nothing else !	5976.48189333344
and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia , her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost importance , and till he entered the room , the misery of her impatience was severe .	4113.135360288629
Some acquaintance or other , my dear , I suppose ;	8104.113915856834
Oh !	6826.5207498362
The venison was roasted to a turn and everybody said , they never saw so fat a haunch .	5342.5141644208425
Your picture may be very exact , Louisa , said Bingley ;	6951.957596740361
That he has neither integrity nor honour .	7715.797229975083
On and Gardiner's coming up , they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment ;	5584.962640555423
nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion .	6883.707178483995
and you cannot imagine how well he looked !	6101.239006164325
How he lived I know not .	9173.610935774615
She has two nieces of her own .	6825.80999429672
But tell me , what did you come down to Netherfield for ?	6100.538194433896
and when I am in town it is pretty much the same .	4944.867045285043
Many small donations ( $1 to $5 , 000 ) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS .	5797.125111781526
Very well .	15076.409862151553
Oh !	6826.5207498362
It is of all subjects my delight .	5910.328749119172
I am sorry to hear that ;	4495.532067661571
and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of Lydia's leaving home .	5159.244720296023
A gentleman and a stranger !	10184.511036424907
He sat with them above an hour , and was in remarkably good spirits .	5745.20559213191
Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia ;	5144.523687794456
what is the matter ?	12781.945091778787
The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia , depended less on any single event , or any particular person , for though they each , like Elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with Wickham , he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them , and a ball was at any rate , a ball .	4043.314964465764
Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ;	5656.477065024154
and pray tell her from me , that she cannot expect to excel , if she does not practise a great deal .	4608.799025593638
I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things .	4144.102004189574
They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room ;	7293.243960459724
nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family .	5359.285368542141
Is my father in town ?	11290.910053501206
If I could but see you as happy !	6777.445505391298
You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling , I am sure you did .	5545.600364549656
It was not till the afternoon , when he joined them at tea , that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject ;	4214.476542420069
Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves , vanity to what we would have others think of us .	6146.053208059817
Heaven forbid !	17926.079642662262
Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule ;	10302.065429185526
And of your infliction , cried Elizabeth with energy .	7001.953942408296
From what he said of Miss Darcy , I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , reserved , disagreeable girl .	5375.1315641455385
Their other aunt also visited them frequently , and always , as she said , with the design of cheering and heartening them up , though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of Wickham's extravagance or irregularity , she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them .	4250.8221513911485
Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday ?	7736.786859610505
Without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ;	5151.262522463069
I depend on you for that .	7640.735496563357
I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it ;	4820.867330133449
In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike , she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man's affection , and though her intentions did not vary for an instant , she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive ;	4152.102892484797
I can remember no symptom of affection on either side ;	5335.730230417489
Your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions ;	5940.840069210693
If you should have no objection to receive me into your house , I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family , Monday , November 18th , by four o'clock , and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se'night following , which I can do without any inconvenience , as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday , provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day .	3786.8146784481874
She knew not how to support herself , and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour .	4777.872394834894
for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation .	4760.705681330243
Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Miss Bennet ;	5427.651966146212
She replied in the affirmative .	8750.12651669961
What is it you mean ?	8385.439299975254
You must feel it ;	8011.845594219759
Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play , she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer .	4780.604398983436
You must come and make Lizzy marry Collins , for she vows she will not have him , and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her .	4202.170248546303
replied her sister .	18472.368653312184
I might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little endeavour at civility , I am thus rejected .	4805.9644412562775
I can easily believe it .	6974.129347058087
Jane , I take your place now , and you must go lower , because I am a married woman .	5460.3386303036805
He took the hint , and soon began with , This seems a very comfortable house .	5033.14370477398
and from all Bingley's connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it , from that very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him , of their becoming hereafter her own .	4271.12906174069
Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have !	7759.413212943
He did look at it and into it for half an hour , was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms , satisfied with what the owner said in its praise , and took it immediately .	4255.55458091175
It adds even another motive .	8934.848045228095
My good qualities are under your protection , and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible ;	5211.053619083629
Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable .	10039.065222713376
We can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough ;	6625.484742950522
too good for the waiter , is not it ?	9475.98293518256
but it had not been so in Derbyshire .	6239.460694905327
Elizabeth , to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this , heard it in silent indignation .	4850.260523217826
What sister would think herself at liberty to do it , unless there were something very objectionable ?	5759.570806134439
but no one looked more amused than Bennet himself , while his wife seriously commended Collins for having spoken so sensibly , and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas , that he was a remarkably clever , good kind of young man .	4156.11097033821
Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour , he had been able to get the better of himself .	6013.260984801464
The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident .	6723.539992625978
My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology .	7003.125801292079
You may depend upon it , Madam , said Miss Bingley , with cold civility , that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us .	4196.61913039291
They could have been understood only by her mother , who might have felt nearly the same .	5471.823059306091
I am sure I shall break mine , said Lydia .	3881.719262593105
His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary ;	6029.137989116645
What relates to yourself , is as follows .	7512.465728344873
dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter , which , in her ladyship's apprehension , peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance , in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew , which she had refused to give .	4563.634437484365
and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations .	5258.593082712736
I do not know .	3780.23139418018
To oblige you , I would try to believe almost any thing , but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this ;	5041.546642836826
There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them , for Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam , the younger son of his uncle , Lord and to the great surprise of all the party , when Collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him .	4264.190926672334
This is my advice .	9264.003228282012
There was also a postscript to this effect .	6452.243511301398
Though her manner varied however , her determination never did .	7721.038380795268
Good gracious !	13201.627108679078
It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day .	4808.101676198237
Yes , I have had a letter from him by express .	5702.038041828089
I am perfectly convinced by it that Darcy has no defect .	4506.823944508902
but when he went away , the whole family returned to their usual employments , and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration , for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden , or in reading and writing , and looking out of window in his own book room , which fronted the road .	3865.275384333504
Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments .	7857.801662051075
Dear madam , cried Hill , in great astonishment , don't you know there is an express come for master from Gardiner ?	5807.338335586568
Gardiner added in his letter , that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day , which was Saturday .	5260.743177426563
and your wit and vivacity I think must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite .	4622.903801110719
only three miles .	17103.64478316344
Kitty , who took all these threats in a serious light , began to cry .	6324.4422303946285
Two of her girls had been on the point of marriage , and after all there was nothing in it .	5947.25697182421
I am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection .	4034.947256485102
I fancy she was wanted about the mince pies .	6529.221657164956
You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy .	4290.813201643447
for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him , I should only think worse of her understanding , than I now do of her heart .	4827.280860159121
A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music , singing , drawing , dancing , and the modern languages , to deserve the word ;	5095.43060793268
We acted with the best intentions .	9268.166588784354
and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room .	6248.2743661024315
there was good humour and kindness .	10047.364502264652
Elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him ;	6166.922985682708
Let me hear from you very soon .	7990.604447198609
and Collins , being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader , was extremely well pleased to close his large book , and go .	4438.816589125539
How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love ?	5499.242412964532
I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me .	5204.394331944138
my dear Bennet , as she entered the room , we have had a most delightful evening , a most excellent ball .	5107.467620712703
cried Bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , if that disagreeable Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley !	4998.596078985245
But we are none of us consistent ;	6837.920829577346
Bennet , who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him , continued her triumph .	5487.261960570309
condolence , insufferable .	18472.368653312184
With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content ;	7879.204887307319
Not at all .	10198.244854769435
Let me congratulate you , on a very important conquest .	6837.969375514691
and you must feel , as well as I do , that the woman who marries him , cannot have a proper way of thinking .	4257.134397721408
but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply .	5173.951207106061
My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness , and I confess that I did not expect to receive more than my due .	4993.772577373782
though when the first tumult of joy was over , she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while .	5311.25580357727
Lizzy declares she will not have Collins , and Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy .	5909.966125066612
The journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane ;	6618.13045543331
All were struck with the stranger's air , all wondered who he could be , and Kitty and Lydia , determined if possible to find out , led the way across the street , under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop , and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot .	4215.3919631621475
Bingley was quite uncomfortable ;	9974.339219077088
He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper ;	7329.878558530547
There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law .	5007.166185011266
But Gardiner could not be seen , and Darcy found , on further enquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning .	4505.965810406171
The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news , and telling again what had been already written ;	5062.865541128083
No ;	15660.948551348763
I shall not go away , till you have given me the assurance I require .	4659.752378544618
but she checked herself .	7550.452162873437
Yet why did he come ?	11896.123119353897
and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls .	5236.4637926972855
On the contrary every particular relative to his sister , was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself ;	5009.649361444417
If it be not so , let Darcy contradict it .	6410.16447798842
I guessed as much .	8941.469901604298
But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person ;	5509.682398642743
This is a parade , cried he , which does one good ;	5862.948389681034
My dear , replied her husband , I have two small favours to request .	5013.875408590647
cried he , turning towards her .	8545.475645394308
The walk being here less sheltered than on the other side , allowed them to see him before they met .	5169.421947322573
That among his own connections he was esteemed and valued that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling .	4423.292764592881
Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing ;	6723.05170772036
Lord !	24005.26131005713
They returned therefore in good spirits to Longbourn , the village where they lived , and of which they were the principal inhabitants .	5103.622736090068
But my father cannot .	8719.15218479791
if , indeed , such a report is in existence .	8231.156981266367
and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in his regimentals .	4596.944639582001
The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw .	5974.0717769031135
As a child , she was affectionate and pleasing , and extremely fond of me ;	5747.316047524742
Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house , and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane .	4936.874520927973
Poor Reynolds , she was always very fond of me .	8102.951639194711
I have certainly meant well through the whole affair .	5270.651687750228
Calling back the servant , therefore , she commissioned him , though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible , to fetch his master and mistress home , instantly .	5169.209143311237
And this is always the way with him , she added .	5903.596379178681
I wish I could say , for the sake of her family , that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children , produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible , amiable , well-informed woman for the rest of her life ;	3676.5982598094856
But my feelings are not only cordial towards him ;	6420.541219513429
It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together , and yet for the advantage of some , conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible .	4186.357926519187
After walking two or three times along that part of the lane , she was tempted , by the pleasantness of the morning , to stop at the gates and look into the park .	4681.59164630255
Upon my honour , I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life , as I have this evening ;	5359.2205427383005
Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the next day , and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Wickham , and give him an invitation also , if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening .	4565.081403139253
Unfeeling , selfish girl !	15633.167043926136
Darcy is engaged to my daughter .	8647.126592091547
I was told , that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married , but that you , that Miss Elizabeth Bennet , would , in all likelihood , be soon afterwards united to my nephew , my own nephew , Darcy .	3874.805754125938
she cried .	10962.818898217341
They owed the restoration of Lydia , her character , every thing to him .	6062.182929595859
and she could no more bear that Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first vehemence of her disapprobation .	4181.093560603234
and could she have included Jane in the scheme , every part of it would have been perfect .	5141.751880429924
You know not what you are about .	6681.615080687322
And upon Elizabeth's seeming really , with vexed and embarrassed looks , about to escape , she added , Lizzy , I insist upon your staying and hearing Collins .	4752.028767769944
sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man .	6509.535052087522
Your list of the common extent of accomplishments , said Darcy , has too much truth .	6051.504278170809
E7 .	26953.136861511783
how he must have felt it !	10414.726981663032
Not at all , he replied ;	7795.444310662191
But Jane knows , as well as I do , what Wickham really is .	5185.129610198971
To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire , when that conviction had been given , was scarcely the work of a moment .	5315.413714604832
La !	22111.518280636905
Of what he has particularly accused me I am ignorant ;	7685.428037537619
And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit ;	5731.479147947907
Its banks were neither formal , nor falsely adorned .	8807.01338069469
As for Elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia , that she considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter ;	4370.642904381549
It is unlucky , said she , after a short pause , that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country .	4033.7971054293466
Not as you represent it .	10665.710558445422
I told you the other day , of his infamous behaviour to Darcy ;	5284.5875062582
And what is fifty miles of good road ?	6476.677698577046
till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk , she made some slight observation on the dance .	5174.194019877945
the compliment must be all for herself .	9162.81977572195
The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected .	6452.581786107462
I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out , if possible , from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment , whether Wickham has any relations or connections , who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself .	3768.841075703033
Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay , for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other .	4555.94991270295
You know not , you can scarcely conceive , how they have tortured me ;	5318.524745158641
A flirt too , in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation ;	6708.831953183379
and if I was her , I would not have put up with it .	4700.136193190965
They were confined for the evening at different tables , and she had nothing to hope , but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room , as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself .	4185.37323860035
PRIDE PREJUDICE .	21632.83805867054
I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters , and beg leave to apologise for it , as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends , but of this hereafter .	3975.4732330108172
but though Jane would have defended either or both , had they appeared to be wrong , she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister .	4641.23385336651
and affectionately taking her hand , said in reply , Do not make yourself uneasy , my love .	4725.313615500259
For heaven's sake , madam , speak lower .	8668.008650146021
when her father continued , You look conscious .	9142.273828999563
When I last saw her , she was not very promising .	6507.47906224512
They are wanted in the farm , Bennet , are not they ?	5334.3071916482995
Elizabeth listened , wondered , doubted , and was impatient for more .	5898.770099865115
The part which I acted , is now to be explained .	6372.72806691619
Elizabeth longed to observe that Bingley had been a most delightful friend ;	5993.708008950919
How merry we shall be together when we meet !	7557.628388468594
When this was done , she had a less active part to play .	6318.961342713331
Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression .	11782.87695425667
She could think only of her letter .	6093.843978138606
but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger .	4922.105197068969
His own father did not long survive mine , and within half a year from these events , Wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally resolved against taking orders , he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be benefited .	4114.820156557246
I do not remember her name among the ladies at court .	4382.212027071816
and as Dawson does not object to the Barouche box , there will be very good room for one of you and indeed , if the weather should happen to be cool , I should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you large .	3936.8124111299353
but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ;	4937.2532403357445
That would be a good scheme , said Elizabeth , if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home .	5003.570282663872
though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Bingley in consequence of it , before they did .	5168.242540840071
This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared ;	5847.722369442054
Not that I am afraid of myself , but I dread other people's remarks .	5774.3778765586385
for give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained .	4523.368840985249
And so , is it quite certain he is coming ?	5843.167772807124
London : Printed for T Egerton , Military Library , Whitehall .	6796.245924649292
Things are settled so oddly .	13637.93872720995
If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity .	4472.560457331316
It was greatly my wish that he should do so , he added , as soon as his marriage was fixed on .	4370.019074125529
You cannot be too much on your guard .	6554.234365531212
I have said no such thing .	5518.402284822616
and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf , is natural and amiable .	4541.273539309856
But it is not merely this affair , she continued , on which my dislike is founded .	4717.156912397001
She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind ;	5518.418691810416
and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment .	5009.548724592124
But I make no doubt , they often talk of it between themselves .	4953.757594008532
and before she could strike into another path , she was overtaken by Wickham .	5558.547907527809
and sometimes did venture a short sentence , when there was least danger of its being heard .	5229.4698502345245
I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ?	4442.83212560355
and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement , without the intention of marriage , she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey .	3947.133061828756
As that was the case , neither Jane , to whom I related the whole , nor I , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public ;	4924.526647950177
After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject , Bennet coolly observed , From all that I can collect by your manner of talking , you must be two of the silliest girls in the country .	4470.318442123735
They are in the same profession , you know ;	6180.463318443456
And I have another favour to ask .	7496.245663150501
She had not been many hours at home , before she found that the Brighton scheme , of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn , was under frequent discussion between her parents .	4109.400714380937
Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton , where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the King , during his mayoralty .	4566.2460928809505
Anxiety on Jane's behalf , was another prevailing concern , and Darcy's explanation , by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion , heightened the sense of what Jane had lost .	5169.150547123138
But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends , will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ?	4227.609639872436
The other is Miss De Bourgh .	7926.03326504623
how rich and how great you will be !	8905.633525121772
And have you heard from him often ?	7557.163566409976
In the absence of Jane , he always attached himself to Elizabeth , for the pleasure of talking of her ;	5009.242558870606
What am I to do ?	9974.44472002514
Engraved for No .	18472.368653312184
Elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint , being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply .	4955.176956849348
That they might have met without ill consequence , is perhaps probable ;	6531.67274028952
But I can guess how it was ;	5701.868061504917
But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else .	4386.499438915434
but neither that , nor any thing else , awakened a suspicion of the truth .	5545.395767382383
I hope there was .	7361.628489772909
1 .	12212.55279990698
But , if I were you , I would stand by the nephew .	5077.292276285504
Darcy walked off ;	12647.583104046094
The officer was the very Denny , concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire , and he bowed as they passed .	4962.268833333114
But here , she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character , for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness , and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet .	4183.316076626298
Had Lydia's marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms , it was not to be supposed that Darcy would connect himself with a family , where to every other objection would now be added , an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned .	4124.694895171053
No , no , let me shift for myself ;	5935.8610937917965
I am impatient to see him .	5316.807288691119
The carriage was sent to meet them at , and they were to return in it , by dinner-time .	5251.779830669973
For forty years , he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support .	5802.458512931942
but Elizabeth heard not a word , and , wholly engrossed by her own feelings , followed them in silence .	4749.034527454315
hang Kitty !	22757.11010138367
And my mother How is she ?	8338.295174151375
From his garden , Collins would have led them round his two meadows , but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost , turned back ;	4923.739273572482
She is happy , then , said her father , drily ;	5219.471643438024
I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing !	5008.525803972809
I wonder when you would have spoken , if I had not asked you !	5101.620567155219
Jane looked well , and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits , amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them .	4838.524754508956
She is almost three and twenty !	6545.702371646106
I must ask whether you were surprised ?	6193.355548148088
She listened most attentively to all that passed between them , and gloried in every expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , his taste , or his good manners .	4458.10190245304
But we are all liable to error .	6837.920829577346
Elizabeth could not but look surprised .	5924.75786464712
Bingley , from this time , was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn ;	6168.840894552924
Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him .	8121.249963470404
Younger sons cannot marry where they like .	11054.031130354546
I believe him to be Lady Catherine's nephew .	6314.019588341163
This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence , and the little value he put on his own good qualities .	5293.235803299243
and after stating her imprudence , I am happy to add , that I owed the knowledge of it to herself .	4622.56925695379
In future , I hope we shall be always of one mind .	6245.372362242765
I hope , my dear , said Bennet to his wife , as they were at breakfast the next morning , that you have ordered a good dinner to-day , because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party .	3869.642900341229
his friend had given him the earliest information of it .	8049.840916671803
But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration , and gave most gracious smiles , especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them .	4685.242049726536
Mary , said she , I wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun !	5572.393181834162
Steady to his purpose , he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday , and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour , he adhered most conscientiously to his book , and would not even look at her .	4563.598058068877
let us hear all the particulars , not forgetting their comparative height and size ;	7377.456950970888
My child , let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life .	5445.311612719796
I am sure I sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night .	3985.5680070839667
Elizabeth's collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ;	8049.913167309557
but it pleased her .	7879.28559226363
It became her turn to listen .	8259.944069357607
Lady Catherine was generally speaking stating the mistakes of the three others , or relating some anecdote of herself .	4918.694282945074
At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress , and at half past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner .	5570.495604333855
and instantly embracing her , acknowledged , with the liveliest emotion , that she was the happiest creature in the world .	4493.5805352568095
He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man , upon my word ;	5719.037653631621
Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year ?	6427.094012153823
but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood , I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger .	4949.481232833763
And who knows what may happen ?	8338.295174151375
They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter , will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others , for who , as lady Catherine herself condescendingly says , will connect themselves with such a family .	4386.577755014266
You have withheld the advantages , which you must know to have been designed for him .	5004.586072259545
If he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , I shall soon cease to regret him at all .	4580.27562237958
but I think I may defy even your sagacity , to discover the name of your admirer .	4833.314261945272
He now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before ;	4253.428678101531
and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted , which , in her anxious interpretation , denoted a recollection of Jane , not untinctured by tenderness , and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her , had he dared .	4122.204186851798
Collins's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete .	9048.14935614114
I do not know what to say to you .	3852.037504491995

After tea , Bennet retired to the library , as was his custom , and Mary went up stairs to her instrument .	5392.533176275541
You must give me leave to judge for myself , and pay me the compliment of believing what I say .	4723.033343721811

Our poor mother is sadly grieved .	10965.299935450652
Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through Longbourn-house .	7493.181542340569
and as it had been asked without the least suspicion , she was not distressed by his repeating it .	4562.2465914065715
and I could wish , Miss Bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either .	3928.5234922917903
Whenever Charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ;	6890.608367827997
But , my dear , you must indeed go and see Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood .	3960.628428142921
Elizabeth was distressed .	8246.069810935844
or me either , for that matter .	9572.858094465937
Haggerston has our directions , and all will be completed in a week .	7674.886508350777
and as she was no horse-woman , walking was her only alternative .	4558.028918364819
Her coming there was the most unfortunate , the most ill-judged thing in the world !	5989.257283791633
and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with , though she could not be in such raptures as Collins expected the scene to inspire , and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house , and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis De Bourgh .	3818.576386332974
The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady , to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable ;	4850.096284702185
Darcy drew his chair a little towards her , and said , You cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment .	5123.649693859662
His being such a charming young man , and so rich , and living but three miles from them , were the first points of self-gratulation ;	4992.023709587696
Let me do it without farther loss of time .	7152.719622126661
sensible that if such an idea had been suggested , his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it .	5651.705015725199
My dear aunt , how could you think of it ?	5646.20288422678
Lady Catherine , I believe , did a great deal to it when Collins first came to Hunsford .	4952.445178052027
I began to be afraid you would never come back again .	5920.766674440183
What could become of Bingley and Jane !	7796.056341030438
I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me , but if the same circumstances were to happen again , I am sure I should be deceived again .	3677.3919958233723
said her mother .	12923.165608335778
good or bad ?	18472.368653312184
They were in street .	8270.898183430898
It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat , and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour .	4090.2193960319314
Darcy had been at her sister's wedding .	8062.673858080365
Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme ;	6462.250098191113
her husband looked impenetrably grave ;	12170.722047920483
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind , as was here collected in one individual .	5139.74118076279
Such as vanity and pride .	11428.51029114814
Miss Lydia is going to be married ;	8675.08881352127
for Bennet , having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase , than she entered the breakfast-room , and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection .	4097.0316454936465
Thank Heaven !	16715.868391186457
We have certainly done our best ;	8177.034317734057
Wickham began the subject himself .	10617.40304560571
Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day , and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation , c .	5004.92421504553
and for the first evening she was his settled choice .	5833.8022864093045
Elizabeth was excessively disappointed ;	7564.826056599243
If your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless , you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ;	4953.2212508308885
The easy assurance of the young couple , indeed , was enough to provoke him .	5679.59176869076
She followed him thither ;	9594.870681843948
He meant to resign his commission immediately ;	7292.677006167972
Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared , Darcy was continually giving offence .	5747.004156497111
that he is to take possession before Michaelmas , and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week .	5019.651901767123
Nor did he seem much more at ease ;	9042.069978313928
Why was he to be the judge ?	9298.066305493474
But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge ?	5343.9171904425175
Hurst and Bingley were at piquet , and Hurst was observing their game .	6692.938059246187
I must beg , therefore , to be importuned no farther on the subject .	4660.046414949998
As the weather was fine , they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park .	5502.320745627203
Then shewing her purchases : Look here , I have bought this bonnet .	6984.727009098058
and so did Forster .	7726.587273847868
I never saw a more promising inclination .	5840.894734088031
Every girl in , or near Meryton , was out of her senses about him for the first two months ;	5689.570971749577
and pray what is the result ?	7167.1949284443135
Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter , and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Bingley himself , instead of a ceremonious card .	4778.023177946452
My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents .	4885.760589348964
Perhaps that is not possible for any one .	8668.008650146021
It was a painful , but not an improbable , conjecture .	4689.417662739879
My mother was taken ill immediately , and the whole house in such confusion !	5648.653096739316
To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered , but the state of indecision in which she remained , as to the extent of what she should communicate ;	3948.3622994426732
And you are never to stir out of doors , till you can prove , that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner .	4643.031934391731
He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from that , I am inclined to hope , he might have been misunderstood before .	4391.324004798647
and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop , or Lady Catherine de Bourgh , by venturing to dance .	3714.649655440296
Do you think it incredible that Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ?	4724.61069662027
but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side , I hope it will not be long before they are .	4536.662385499434
Elizabeth was pleased to find , that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend , for , though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world , she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him .	3945.8432717991795
But who could have foreseen such an attention as this ?	6379.939547882202
and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin's affairs , and whose character she had no reason to question .	4073.9544336323133
Compliments always take you by surprise , and me never .	8901.140435246996
or under what misrepresentation , can you here impose upon others ?	7545.408299509613
My feelings in every respect forbid it .	7976.191945291854
The families who had been in town for the winter came back again , and summer finery and summer engagements arose .	5094.289568662983
I could not bear to have her ten miles from me ;	5516.183624752994
Such were the gentle murmurs of Bennet , and they gave way only to the greater distress of Bingley's continued absence .	5483.308714082261
Jane was so admired , nothing could be like it .	6710.040805085378
their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ;	7400.053211685994
You ought all to have learned .	8409.953421908764
yes , said Elizabeth drily Darcy is uncommonly kind to Bingley , and takes a prodigious deal of care of him .	5657.93068964542
If it be so , if I have been misled by such error , to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable .	4724.085904184709
I am a gentleman's daughter ;	5732.84659089822
But I confess they would have no charms for me .	5428.148556219777
That is my idea of good breeding ;	6896.553594865278
but , to be sure , it would have been such a thing for me !	4833.167719012593
But I am willing to hope the best , and that his character has been misunderstood .	4574.903971041436
But their father , though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure , was really glad to see them ;	4966.3370816814495
To be sure , Lizzy , said her aunt , he is not so handsome as Wickham ;	5154.136375906365
Wickham so very bad !	12360.794420092652
She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire , and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister , in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter .	4383.428032415011
Every thing was too recent for gaiety , but the evening passed tranquilly away ;	6297.7556818682215
and yet , it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham .	4501.350930419601
Most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote .	6431.193306990189
He was on one side of her mother .	5856.490371340166
He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given me .	4546.158510245694
Collins must excuse me .	11682.816353253438
I wish you very happy and very rich , and by refusing your hand , do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise .	4356.432966878879
but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing .	6004.195054231177
Bennet made no answer .	8658.960486867933
The hill , crowned with wood , from which they had descended , receiving increased abruptness from the distance , was a beautiful object .	4903.992820696028
She was humbled , she was grieved ;	5959.175507447497
He who , she had been persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest enemy , seemed , on this accidental meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance , and without any indelicate display of regard , or any peculiarity of manner , where their two selves only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister .	3945.453689037431
Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received , in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense .	5030.363306581302
By the Author of Sense and Sensibility .	6150.880034801649
These are heavy misfortunes , replied Elizabeth .	8630.762813970485
and I assure you , I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement .	4383.24411948327
I felt nothing but surprise .	7909.810216643001
Did he know of their intending to go off ?	8409.78539583371
Give my love to Colonel Forster , I hope you will drink to our good journey .	6555.518990909287
Lady Catherine has been of infinite use , which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use .	4897.530529979375
Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers' names and connections .	6674.271739612474
That she should have walked three miles so early in the day , in such dirty weather , and by herself , was almost incredible to Hurst and Miss Bingley ;	4573.702755548543
she continued to declare that she would , and the argument ended only with the visit .	6036.119533070454
for else they will be destitute enough .	8443.450398382036
We were married , you know , at Clement's , because Wickham's lodgings were in that parish .	5576.239626818518
A great deal more passed at the other table .	7004.466337511556
They descended the hill , crossed the bridge , and drove to the door ;	5821.424461923529
But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her , so soon after this event .	5204.280878881557
The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte's situation , and his expectation of a young olive-branch .	4901.0939126598
I never thought Darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do .	4877.886483018028
The children , two girls of six and eight years old , and two younger boys , were to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane , who was the general favourite , and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way teaching them , playing with them , and loving them .	4008.84800455054
He arranges the business just as he pleases .	7120.709804949512
I have a warm , unguarded temper , and I may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him , and to him , too freely .	4122.791182632471
Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth .	7841.658663754897
and had I been the rector of Longbourn , I should very strenuously have opposed it .	5067.758686682181
A little sea-bathing would set me up for ever .	7109.309240416227
a most convenient distance for the young ladies , who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week , to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner's shop just over the way .	4767.400257820106
Oh !	6826.5207498362
Elizabeth would not observe her ;	8786.885371499928
After sitting a few minutes , they were all sent to one of the windows , to admire the view , Collins attending them to point out its beauties , and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer .	4223.3791600067725
The others then joined her , and expressed their admiration of his figure ;	5853.598358891574
I wish I could hear that you , my dearest friend , had any intention of making one in the croud , but of that I despair .	4087.076878487432
We will go as far as Meryton with you , said Catherine and Lydia .	5811.092948546122
I hope they will not meet at all .	5943.708047408492
Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom , which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family .	5508.940045359751
Collins knew not what to make of him .	8266.636073675554
One came from her books , and the other from her toilette .	7228.158302768493
Very well .	15076.409862151553
She could not determine how her mother would take it ;	5372.546658590879
And have you answered the letter ?	8061.357672547779
Pemberley was now Georgiana's home ;	13637.93872720995
I am very sensible , madam , of the hardship to my fair cousins , and could say much on the subject , but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate .	3840.754703297356
my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ?	4552.701515240432
Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House , whichever it might be , where Darcy then was .	5080.347043786841
Gracechurch-street , Sept .	16881.267654101517
All connection between us seemed now dissolved .	9468.269087018452
He keeps a man-servant , does he ?	7761.9054287946265
It was lady Catherine de Bourgh .	5915.644420884327
She is so fond of Forster , said she , it will be quite shocking to send her away !	4585.835997087127
my dear Charlotte , impossible !	9940.59661700534
and I doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself , Darcy .	4541.539528434785
CHAPTER XIX .	11746.06741553873
and after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family .	4539.145914119712
What will be his surprise , thought she , when he knows who they are !	5784.605979040005
For a few moments , indeed , she felt that he would probably strike into some other path .	5927.424143725978
He was angry .	8178.3604727446
A man who has once been refused !	7799.724780227746
most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman's education .	5415.211956635371
Upon my word , said Gardiner , I begin to be of your uncle's opinion .	5227.198562311555
She had no fear of its spreading farther , through his means .	5242.887435797815
Nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination , said Elizabeth .	6515.687155438921
Do you draw ?	11032.94372362244
You go to Brighton !	9360.703768951205
and the others were to meet us at the church .	5265.955373639497
No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you , can think any thing wanting .	5939.980906506031
He added , that Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present , to leave London , and promised to write again very soon .	5051.656556561166
How I long to see her !	7564.736017942717
Elizabeth made no answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Darcy , and reading in her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it .	4016.7578963557735
Miss Bingley saw , or suspected enough to be jealous ;	6172.955436885769
and , though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy's father , five years before , it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends , than she had been in the way of procuring .	3908.166997842155
The business of her life was to get her daughters married ;	6222.6362537729365
Darcy took her advice , and did finish his letter .	6547.746410530503
Bingley was good looking and gentleman-like ;	8369.467842264034
Had not my own feelings decided against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man , who has been the means of ruining , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ?	4290.624067450355
if I should ever go to Brighton , I would behave better than Lydia .	6929.77077458434
It is I believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world .	4482.351221915016
She felt it so ;	8129.439565096266
and when Bennet joined them at supper , his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was .	4608.10247505078
Elizabeth felt Jane's pleasure .	8994.09607244337
Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal , and felt persuaded of her sister's ready acquiescence .	4954.079958046598
But I will no longer importune my young cousin .	5260.098590520478
Then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce Bingley to her .	5419.534537983496
That he was really fond of Jane , she doubted no more than she had ever done ;	5297.0766595733485
At present , however , I consider myself as quite fixed here .	6458.389909601662
a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification ;	8102.951639194711
Mary and Kitty were both with Bennet : one communication would , therefore , do for all .	5826.334395933186
unless when some barbarous neighbour , who could not be enough detested , had given him an invitation to dinner , which he thought himself obliged to accept .	5415.211956635371
Had she not seen him in Derbyshire , she might have supposed him capable of coming there , with no other view than what was acknowledged ;	5006.111189570523
She dreaded seeing Wickham again , and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible .	5418.659825765139
How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton !	6419.753423167509
why did she come ?	15633.167043926136
Darcy was writing , and Miss Bingley , seated near him , was watching the progress of his letter , and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister .	4493.694086976986
Why did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight ?	6919.997973478595
They must be a great loss to your family .	6778.367798799773
And on the gentlemen's approaching , one of the girls moved closer to her than ever , and said , in a whisper , The men shan't come and part us , I am determined .	4451.480896608439
and it was not till Easter-day , almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival , that they were honoured by such an attention , and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening .	3849.4276696841234
Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room , and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless .	5546.220283234635
( by the bye , Forster and me are such friends ) and so she asked the two Harringtons to come , but Harriet was ill , and so Pen was forced to come by herself ;	4978.205058928437
The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow .	4965.252030512497
At first there seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely , for she was a most determined talker ;	5793.047029046316
They were of a respectable family in the north of England ;	5522.145789060686
though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy .	6565.515311835202
Bennet was not in the habit of walking , Mary could never spare time , but the remaining five set off together .	4864.235017281258
Accordingly , when she retired at night , she asked the chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place , what was the name of its proprietor , and with no little alarm , whether the family were down for the summer .	4730.3001766694015
But if you will listen to his letter , you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself .	4583.54654899607
She is a very headstrong foolish girl , and does not know her own interest ;	4408.390094463668
I had often seen him in love before .	6046.794649495041
Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion , sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation .	5089.661740556987
consequently that she is aunt to the present Darcy .	9475.89221511754
Miss Bingley did the same ;	8309.08838045631
Elizabeth did all she could , to shield him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification ;	4337.86648683321
In that county , there was enough to be seen , to occupy the chief of their three weeks ;	5327.70537831586
You and papa , and my sisters , must come down and see us .	5791.369432063772
but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley , she dropt all her resentment ;	4807.400191384391
for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire , and of his being gone into the regulars .	5038.147337455134
The motive professed , was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known , as to make it impossible for any young woman of character , to love or confide in him .	4332.5392446632095
If he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare , he determined to make enquiries there , and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach .	4228.114687019714

I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say .	4913.939202648083
I do not trust my own partiality .	4703.705814242992
Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits .	6337.812901244465
In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her a present from my master ;	5163.378986477807
And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock .	6044.230286784609
You cannot be more than twenty , I am sure , therefore you need not conceal your age .	4771.030759693948
and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment .	4223.990742304056

But if you have got them to-day , said Elizabeth , my mother's purpose will be answered .	4866.506158163969
And when I returned home , the shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time .	5234.638673905486
I could not have parted with you , my Lizzy , to any one less worthy .	4968.426357526142
and he and Bennet spent the morning together , as had been agreed on .	4967.388461543583
made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow's debts , and got him his commission !	6246.510457995342
You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works , reports , performances and research .	4760.059672856873
On entering the room , he seemed to hesitate ;	7449.322395360925
I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it .	5420.5406864243
Sometime hence it will be all found out , and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before .	5867.342681922974
or had you intended any more serious consequence ?	8905.633525121772
I am trying to make it out .	5309.473257449129
I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet , she is really a very sweet girl , and I wish with all my heart she were well settled .	4033.636318893898
I am not one and twenty .	4650.192435311404
Will it not be advisable , before we proceed on this subject , to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request , as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties ?	4586.44899181359
I am afraid you do not like your pen .	4540.366120982928
Then , after a short silence , he continued , Lizzy , I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May , which , considering the event , shews some greatness of mind .	4543.31023854941
It was as follows : MY DEAR SIR , I feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire .	3928.744456887235
Her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved .	8996.374037255282
I admire all my three sons-in-law highly , said he .	5861.173657769587
I should be sorry indeed , if it were .	4900.036681750344
Darcy made no answer .	8570.500168149516
Darcy , you cannot deny the fact .	7182.4124610656445
and within five miles of Lambton , Elizabeth found from her aunt , that Pemberley was situated .	5138.119887257537
I have never heard him say so ;	5617.870043624773
and his answering immediately to the last question Oh !	5877.255831144803
Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness , and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover , she could not prevent its frequently recurring .	5225.009343457171
Darcy mentioned his letter .	11116.893048796135
Kitty , to her very material advantage , spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters .	5655.911901128711
but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away , just as they were all getting so intimate together .	4307.870422973039
But I tell you what , Miss Lizzy , if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at all and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead .	3670.7190655999475
I will not be interrupted .	5878.821019917367
I desire you will do no such thing .	5958.740722340002
Elizabeth did not know what to make of it .	6380.250005127453
Elizabeth said nothing , but it gratified her exceedingly ;	6734.286455412032
I will answer for it he never cared three straws about her .	5160.34318862768
I am grieved , indeed , cried Darcy ;	5151.807763933722
And now here's Bennet gone away , and I know he will fight Wickham , wherever he meets him , and then he will be killed , and what is to become of us all ?	4495.595792803532
Gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her .	6336.98805117446
Yes if Darcy does not put it off again .	7670.023130867775
but it would not do ;	7315.519949359144
Since the shire were first quartered in Meryton , nothing but love , flirtation , and officers , have been in her head .	5662.068448429603
and , after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt , her resentment gave way , either to her affection for him , or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself ;	3995.124865320023
I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing .	4830.020407636252
I have been making the tour of the Park , he replied , as I generally do every year , and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage .	3981.924878017102
Perhaps he thought her too young .	9525.096544580634
The fishing scheme had been renewed the day before , and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon .	4739.754033252959
I am not so selfish , however , as to press for it , if inconvenient .	4076.9495654285292
I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself .	5591.115833885639
What he told me was merely this ;	8222.743332239254
To Elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ;	4381.639237862717
Hill began instantly to express her joy .	11054.031130354546
but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes , and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt .	4708.084494983255
Indeed !	22116.04916256548
There is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King .	6140.188075195013
Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish ;	5998.674588680565
My dear Lizzy , do not give way to such feelings as these .	4650.217939485904
in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of every thing , she was still dear to him .	5571.208281392467
The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's match , which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true !	4023.94420869846
A military life is not what I was intended for , but circumstances have now made it eligible .	5694.1222242666645
And , besides , no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road .	5477.567077468428
She was roused from her seat , and her reflections , by some one's approach ;	4855.839868896688
She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken .	6977.075554900001
it is of no consequence .	9569.555725033704
Elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion , that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Bingley's invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's amusement ;	4290.64740788251
In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty ;	5128.848802483238
A most delightful place !	10888.008107781303
To Kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected .	6724.011169062316
We may compare our different opinions .	8748.193733376303
This will never do .	10805.150761729272
the door was then allowed to be shut , and the carriage drove off .	6271.008839106041
such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her , and she began her song .	6849.081340719637
Lydia gaped as he opened the volume , and before he had , with very monotonous solemnity , read three pages , she interrupted him with , Do you know , mama , that my uncle Philips talks of turning away Richard , and if he does , Colonel Forster will hire him .	4345.25867465976
CHAPTER XVIII .	13083.650239159624
You know nothing of the matter .	6760.869727397249
Sir William did not say much .	9096.815777014288
She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico , muslin , and cambric , and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders , had not Jane , though with some difficulty , persuaded her to wait , till her father was at leisure to be consulted .	3924.110453450886
but , had she still felt any , it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself , on seeing her again .	4388.499521561889
He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance , and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption ;	4997.714676896183
Insolent girl !	22757.11010138367
but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful .	5825.127522254776
While she spoke , Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words , or to distrust their meaning .	5346.808757555805
and when she had gone through the whole letter , though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two , put it hastily away , protesting that she would not regard it , that she would never look in it again .	3960.5538898391374
Oh !	6826.5207498362
Painful recollections will intrude , which cannot , which ought not to be repelled .	7377.5628887935445
Allowing for the common demands of the game , Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth , and she was very willing to hear him , though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told , the history of his acquaintance with Darcy .	4519.7798737096455
He cannot know what Darcy is .	8022.617778809998
With the officers !	12267.16387125822
Charlotte says , she hardly ever does .	9936.584974667936
Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below .	8901.220315177266
I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady .	5373.181494348741
and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love .	4542.610209823042
Oh , yes !	6953.750776902737
You have deprived the best years of his life , of that independence which was no less his due than his desert .	4697.628273894489
No , no I feel he may defy us there .	5995.259358026593
It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy .	6655.523568982061
untamed , unabashed , wild , noisy , and fearless .	8901.060544562486
You look pale .	11284.162217649346
but , whenever she did catch a glimpse , she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said , she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed , however temporary its existence might prove , had at least outlived one day .	3896.238833776174
but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly .	4269.529999853276
If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew , I shall certainly not be kept from it , by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss De Bourgh .	4394.020165725359
but it is to the credit of his modesty .	5645.856458838356
He was at the same time haughty , reserved , and fastidious , and his manners , though well bred , were not inviting .	4438.064963632616
re-considering events , determining probabilities , and reconciling herself as well as she could , to a change so sudden and so important , fatigue , and a recollection of her long absence , made her at length return home ;	4641.528672068663
The evening conversation , when they were all assembled , had lost much of its animation , and almost all its sense , by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth .	4415.007457434019
CHAPTER II .	11746.06741553873
Can there be any other opinion on the subject ?	8409.78539583371
he will immediately comprehend what I must feel , and I rely upon his goodness .	6158.761963398079
Lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath ;	5662.321191574638
Depend upon it , my dear , that when there are twenty , I will visit them all .	6401.249424989344
She was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger , and wondered it had escaped her before .	4395.50784805453
It is highly improper .	6927.31936182205
He leaves out half his words , and blots the rest .	6427.446597504083
To complete the favourable impression , she then told him what Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia .	5827.493472155156
and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to , a wish of being better acquainted with them , was expressed towards the two eldest .	4033.223432239592
Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring ?	8774.794878484125
She looks sickly and cross .	8750.12651669961
Upon my word , Caroline , I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by imitation .	4987.260773731894
Who should suffer but myself ?	11782.87695425667
Your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach , that the contentment arising from them , is not of philosophy , but what is much better , of ignorance .	4880.71727231592
My father and mother knew nothing of that , they only felt how imprudent a match it must be .	4907.206410488455
I had much rather go in the coach .	6046.794649495041
The adieu is charity itself .	8862.155784659559
I am truly glad , dearest Lizzy , that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes ;	4375.813322004631
Collins , did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe's calling yesterday to thank me ?	5950.76333665312
He is now perhaps sorry for what he has done , and anxious to re-establish a character .	4956.175593850464
and if , as you were mounting your horse , a friend were to say , 'Bingley , you had better stay till next week , ' you would probably do it , you would probably not go and , at another word , might stay a month .	3957.3695816998247
I have heard from authority , which I thought as good , that it was left you conditionally only , and at the will of the present patron .	4069.569041461175
Collins was eloquent in her praise .	8507.008459462557
but Elizabeth saw , with admiration of his taste , that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine ;	4956.6337337067835
Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room ;	6100.527970866338
As they walked across the lawn towards the river , Elizabeth turned back to look again ;	5532.649636780904
Oh , Lord !	9629.754343160064
Well , Jane , make haste and tell us ;	6431.993180665123
If you believed it impossible to be true , said Elizabeth , colouring with astonishment and disdain , I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far .	4532.993820234504
I know you do ;	6628.732846139425
In confirmation of this , she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected , without actually naming her authority , but stating it to be such as might be relied on .	4503.930571596341
Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town ;	6804.597996543198
They were all astonished ;	7942.363971465349
I cannot believe it .	7037.107981624873
adding , with a significant smile , I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here .	4887.345356424532
He answered her in the same style , and the subject dropped .	6073.879908973782
I would not be so fastidious as you are , cried Bingley , for a kingdom !	4814.485027677727
Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ;	5495.672432685968
Indeed I am .	13245.89811546444
Your profusion makes me saving ;	10517.970518673485
She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of ill humour , which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her .	4043.369519197429
Oh !	6826.5207498362
She is a very fine-looking woman !	5262.111356578178
and there was no necessity for such attention .	6598.897952271818
I was sometimes quite provoked , but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane , and for their sakes had patience with her .	4395.42532224474
Are you so severe upon your own sex , as to doubt the possibility of all this ?	5776.580414155454
but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham ;	5118.198665696504
and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you .	4280.925955462041
That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment , as to refuse his daughter a privilege , without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid , exceeded all that she could believe possible .	4503.537364179149
It must not be thought of .	7287.508858487185
Oh , Jane , had we been less secret , had we told what we knew of him , this could not have happened !	4598.200047749121
Our instrument is a capital one , probably superior to You shall try it some day .	6509.406179509384
You thought the waiter must not hear , as if he cared !	6128.27826959737
said Elizabeth to herself .	11084.698689770896
He protested that except Lady Catherine and her daughter , he had never seen a more elegant woman ;	5087.258430050526
He was her dear Wickham on every occasion ;	6028.399385534825
You must contrive to send somebody .	6972.762544318713
Let me never see either one or the other again !	6837.969375514691
But why Darcy came so often to the Parsonage , it was more difficult to understand .	5338.291016898592
Oh !	6826.5207498362
It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Darcy himself ;	4567.495669697915
There is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair , on which I do not reflect with satisfaction ;	4822.735511595162
A great many indeed , said her companion with a sigh .	6451.38141472679
Yes , my youngest is not sixteen .	6999.86353848315
Yes , Sir , I know I am .	6469.2598404747605
She tried , however , to compose herself to answer him with patience , when he should have done .	5138.564560485148
Sir William staid only a week at Hunsford ;	7930.496900214718
The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him .	5679.552929626116
his brow contracted , his air gloomy .	9767.695682389953
Only let me assure you , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage .	5245.4116197939875
Every thing nourishes what is strong already .	8665.552531425392
how I laughed !	13894.442761056183
but you must lend us the money , for we have just spent ours at the shop out there .	4826.581379832314
His friend had left him that morning for London , but was to return home in ten days time .	5522.0077499945655
When Bennet arrived , he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure .	6045.944433217167
I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character , in a part of the world , where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit .	3943.887023801319
But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham .	5736.074534235497
Darcy had walked away to another part of the room .	6369.578495845978
Was not this some excuse for incivility , if I was uncivil ?	7716.627457159205
Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father , who had intended to purchase an estate , but did not live to do it .	4832.713194324004
that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that one false step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful , and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex .	4398.482708811395
Our importance , our respectability in the world , must be affected by the wild volatility , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia's character .	5219.644910416369
I have found out , said he , by a singular accident , that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness .	4228.907520076142
My dearest sister , now be be serious .	7248.394027397506
but Charlotte , she soon found , was depending on the plan , and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty .	4656.865585444637
to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where , and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with .	5314.37121241218
Their mutual affection will steady them ;	9771.421732755569
He came , and in such very good time , that the ladies were none of them dressed .	5284.954474442223
and certainly ought not to have appeared ;	7151.198247781011
and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , I have not yet learnt to condemn them .	4243.149631384651
But , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes time , and then we all set out .	4713.521975280796
and if the second , I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire .	4703.240949877737
Yes , she called yesterday with her father .	6337.681340192141
It is from Miss Bingley , said Jane , and then read it aloud .	4812.602022358516
My poor father !	11529.449545737109
Elizabeth instantly read her feelings , and at that moment solicitude for Wickham , resentment against his enemies , and every thing else gave way before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness .	4453.63727253471
A thousand things may arise in six months !	8091.7293118139205
We do not suffer by accident .	8662.74803534955
and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters , in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about .	4115.0563935778455
Your's , c .	10483.694660383553
Elizabeth almost stared at her .	9116.69839526504
Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time , but Darcy they had only seen at church .	5339.978036020773
Gracechurch-street , Monday , August 2 .	11376.152144143634
but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me .	5072.850481821428
and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia's flight , on her own folly alone .	5229.502501769614
She was received , however , very politely by them ;	5387.9054782143785
You must not be too severe upon yourself , replied Elizabeth .	5171.185719074579
The country , said Darcy , can in general supply but few subjects for such a study .	5348.005708650335
She had only to say in reply , that they had wandered about , till she was beyond her own knowledge .	4574.163960634384
His pride , in that direction , may be of service , if not to himself , to many others , for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by .	4490.416979116301
I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation , replied Elizabeth , but it is not in my power to accept it .	4048.548278070045
But he found , in reply to this question , that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country .	4413.962698408779
Pride , observed Mary , who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections , is a very common failing I believe .	5867.312593989028
My friend has an excellent understanding though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Collins as the wisest thing she ever did .	5054.157369082787
This was not very consoling to Bennet , and , therefore , instead of making any answer , she went on as before , I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate .	4377.927765828696
in which case you may be sure of my pardon .	7816.814494757994
the windows are full west .	10925.480661504966
neither did the apothecary , who arrived about the same time , think it at all advisable .	6689.2092334008585
The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this .	5820.332227395714
Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls , and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him .	4820.204458478217
You deserve no such attention .	9112.011185922915
for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend's dislike would vanish , if she could suppose him to be in her power .	4782.473739870195
The next morning , as she was going down stairs , she was met by her father , who came out of his library with a letter in his hand .	4464.996609280601
Yet it did , and even a third .	9142.273828999563
I am glad he is gone .	4851.897297345983
There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself .	4781.97410725048
With such rivals for the notice of the fair , as Wickham and the officers , Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance ;	5238.03116712535
but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only .	5628.640454748
Who could about such a nasty little freckled thing ?	8285.526262545967
A small sum could not do all this .	7860.820038085562
and having to relate such a thing of his sister !	6091.977430909504
Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt .	7417.38641081591
I almost envy you the pleasure , and yet I believe it would be too much for me , or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle .	4524.383947623391
Oh !	6826.5207498362
Poor Charlotte !	18859.062262567415
She grew absolutely ashamed of herself .	8103.270527315195
Oh !	6826.5207498362
We must trespass a little longer on your kindness .	7082.015762012422
Philips's vulgarity was another , and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance ;	7674.886508350777
I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back .	4581.155097129919
Had the late Darcy liked me less , his son might have borne with me better ;	6155.539855936449
Oh !	6826.5207498362
It would not be easy , indeed , to catch their expression , but their colour and shape , and the eye-lashes , so remarkably fine , might be copied .	4428.840627444677
And poor Darcy !	11670.057232597592
You are lucky in having such a master .	6158.124610704307
Is this to be endured !	10601.66124644477
Mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted ;	7278.2550513041815
It was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re-animated , and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's attractions .	4040.497260152423
I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side , for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing , if she had been well looked after .	3740.630946812447
It is Bingley I am sure .	5564.902768261429
It cannot be for me , it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened .	5014.885187202508
He had by that time reached it also , and holding out a letter , which she instinctively took , said with a look of haughty composure , I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you .	4133.434030727872
the former continued the subject , by saying , But tell me all and every thing about it , which I have not already heard .	5224.0778331403735
my dear Lydia , she cried , when shall we meet again ?	6610.496603423205
and sleeping one night on the road , reached Longbourn by dinner-time the next day .	5332.158797810337
Yes , I call it a very easy distance .	6089.563063210636
and then till her sister came down , she had to listen to all he had to say , of his own happiness , and of Jane's perfections ;	4320.953300186535
Elizabeth immediately began playing again .	9116.69839526504
Good gracious !	13201.627108679078
To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh ;	6894.419787144111
where , where is my uncle ?	11276.841140791801
And with no one to speak to , of what I felt , no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had !	4390.055622772463
How could I ever think her like her nephew ?	6404.386421806023
Within doors there was Lady Catherine , books , and a billiard table , but gentlemen cannot be always within doors ;	6072.280087146251
A house in town !	11338.388268702625
It seemed like wilful ill-nature , or a voluntary penance , for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away , but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her .	4283.691795865734
I am going to Gretna Green , and if you cannot guess with who , I shall think you a simpleton , for there is but one man in the world I love , and he is an angel .	3751.0570488270446
But perhaps , added he , stopping in his walk , and turning towards her , these offences might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design .	4168.172019129423
Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten ;	8914.628507904577
Well , well , and so Bingley is coming down , sister , ( for Philips first brought her the news ) Well , so much the better .	4214.974433561038
We never had any governess .	10130.96629713281
and no change was visible in either , except that the loss of her favourite sister , or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business , had given something more of fretfulness than usual , to the accents of Kitty .	4179.380977512405
With the mention of Derbyshire , there were many ideas connected .	6781.766997724984
and detestable as such a step must make her were it known , she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go .	4507.088086917289
He seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologised for his intrusion , by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within .	4689.197787808528
for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce .	6024.535915970668
With a stronger voice she soon added , I have this comfort immediately , that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side , and that it has done no harm to any one but myself .	4324.305937455013
and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane , received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth .	4457.4743448971285
Collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure , and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview , with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied , since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character .	4182.47202733995
but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy's opinion , and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities , by which some part of her family were connected with that corps .	3843.505021171192
I suppose you have heard of it ;	6757.708581551568
VOL .	22111.518280636905
and , though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene .	3784.169275584129
added Elizabeth ;	22757.11010138367
In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton and see how every body went on ;	4757.446109658989
She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject , and related , with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration , the shocking rudeness of Darcy .	4250.781067274311
and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource , if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family , were unfavourably answered .	4199.409887398842
But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible ;	5910.801578221869
I believe I have now told you every thing .	5906.617596848818
He did trace them easily to Clapham , but no farther ;	5924.411106796015
This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers , but Bennet , who quarrelled with no compliments , answered most readily , You are very kind , sir , I am sure ;	4573.834889074974
And gathering her work together , she was hastening away , when Elizabeth called out , Dear Ma'am , do not go .	5135.88091378914
for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him .	5137.355678449738
Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy , and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps .	5118.562506119261
On the gentlemen's appearing , her colour increased ;	7379.259380916481
Oh !	6826.5207498362
yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said , You are mistaken , Darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way , than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner .	4133.865815428047
and then thought no more of the matter : and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them , restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike .	4269.408689201445
and in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard .	4246.567340278046
as good natured , and as unaffected , though not quite so chatty .	7313.707663984977
for of what use could it apparently be to any one , that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him , should then be overthrown ?	4885.192956856672
Oh !	6826.5207498362
He could number the fields in every direction , and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump .	4857.361791501923
Bennet had very often wished , before this period of his life , that , instead of spending his whole income , he had laid by an annual sum , for the better provision of his children , and of his wife , if she survived him .	4241.195323960751
His sisters were fine women , with an air of decided fashion .	6175.500221435709
On the following Monday , Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife , who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn .	4788.343414901206
Kitty has no discretion in her coughs , said her father ;	7581.146972648865
she really rejoiced at it .	10465.241711191953
By many significant looks and silent entreaties , did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance , but in vain ;	5527.18388820921
He answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily .	4371.760317547338
and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion , that whenever Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate , it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at James's .	4134.629220677621
Miss Lucas is married and settled .	8835.590659784863
Bingley was ready , Georgiana was eager , and Darcy determined , to be pleased .	5747.004156497111
and she could do nothing but think , and think with wonder , of Darcy's civility , and above all , of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister .	3951.207402114535
Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight , and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister .	5583.510073813336
The good news quickly spread through the house ;	7254.174979708635
Let us hope , therefore , that her being there may teach her her own insignificance .	5891.350201393242
He seldom appeared really animated .	8980.030091838973
Having now a good house and very sufficient income , he intended to marry ;	6983.388612275768
You refuse , then , to oblige me .	7202.809489632191
Miss Bingley I am sure cannot .	7728.163959738194
and , moreover , to enter into an engagement of allowing her , during your life , one hundred pounds per annum .	4386.822314867024
After sitting a little while with Jane , on Miss Bingley's appearance and invitation , the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour .	4848.527188737543
names , facts , every thing mentioned without ceremony .	9475.89221511754
Lady Catherine seemed pleased .	8446.168525900726
Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest .	8978.136308329638
I have not that pain .	5249.280349526275
The ladies were somewhat more fortunate , for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window , that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse .	4579.991046561872
he had a pleasant countenance , and easy , unaffected manners .	6648.803233476432
and I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body .	4495.862740756756
his civility , therefore , was most prompt in inviting Collins to join his daughters in their walk ;	6087.64890121816
But I knew I should persuade you at last .	5442.212394011287
though it was not put in as it ought to be .	6516.408862017584
the agitations of former partiality entirely so .	9162.81977572195
but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune , part from her authoritative manner , and the rest from the pride of her nephew , who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class .	3973.6713899872097
She was not the better pleased with his gallantry , from the idea it suggested of something more .	4483.622842013132
Sir William could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves .	5520.621015283879
The letter was to this effect : MY DEAR LIZZY , I wish you joy .	5437.214985800282
Your own heart , your own conscience , must tell you why I come .	6395.24890222129
without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person ;	9475.89221511754
and to Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction .	6038.117337181991
I wonder what he can be doing there .	6185.7253517795125
Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment ;	6662.161214700999
What , all five out at once ?	8042.866479421989
Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance , when you were in Kent ?	6385.379196478506
After walking several miles in a leisurely manner , and too busy to know any thing about it , they found at last , on examining their watches , that it was time to be at home .	4585.846783801082
but she does not know , no one can know how much I suffer from what she says .	4806.789072179506
Wickham , after a few moments , touched his hat a salutation which Darcy just deigned to return .	5734.95737573008
But , Lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it .	4591.95609442789
Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss De Bourgh ate , pressing her to try some other dish , and fearing she were indisposed .	5566.780244081336
Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage .	6395.24890222129
But when her mother was gone , Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters .	4575.600231907493
What a stroke was this for poor Jane !	7149.943695544861
and she had barely time to express her satisfaction , and prepare for such a visitor , when Bingley's quick step was heard on the stairs , and in a moment he entered the room .	3980.7365832126147
Yes ;	11624.632075734577
Oh , yes !	6953.750776902737
Such a change in a man of so much pride , excited not only astonishment but gratitude for to love , ardent love , it must be attributed ;	4951.698042000987
I am sure , she added , if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and suffers a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without exception , the sweetest temper I ever met with .	3568.6149465850895
She was confident of having performed her duty , and to fret over unavoidable evils , or augment them by anxiety , was no part of her disposition .	4275.777894693361
You will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one .	5347.023948205895
She is a handsome girl , about fifteen or sixteen , and I understand highly accomplished .	4546.708922974186
repeated the other , as she ran into her room to prepare .	7716.627457159205
Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them ;	7224.8976628438895
She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever ;	6016.327696119827
Lady Catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us , were the means of removing all my doubts .	5948.634317827366
I expected to find a more reasonable young woman .	6234.4918443805855
Darcy , only for a few minutes to take leave , but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour , hoping for her return , and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found .	4297.514074241202
Give me farther particulars .	15012.190929676433
do not repeat what I then said .	10302.179232725386
That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain , but I will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears .	4780.374879288914
Gardiner looked at her niece , desirous of knowing how she , whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its acceptance , but Elizabeth had turned away her head .	4621.374414487577
He really believed , that were it not for the inferiority of her connections , he should be in some danger .	5121.786828424808
Her ladyship received them civilly , but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else ;	4802.822703911117
Collins , said she , speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter ;	5459.902355454854
He is just what a young man ought to be , said she , sensible , good humoured , lively ;	4759.029458880135
And when we do return , it shall not be like other travellers , without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing .	4774.125293824601
Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection .	8156.599535508477
He simpers , and smirks , and makes love to us all .	6212.202210402618
I cannot understand it .	7037.107981624873
Can you , yourself , Lizzy , so wholly give him up , as to believe him capable of it ?	5638.553924910126
She was a woman of mean understanding , little information , and uncertain temper .	4838.244480401457
said Elizabeth , but the terms , I suppose , must be complied with .	6088.046813213165
Yes , Miss Bennet , interest ;	7420.248399443985
The visit was returned in due form .	7675.607661452701
But Jane was to go home with her , and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation .	5026.34202605554
They were ignorant , idle , and vain .	6275.03467431102
Yes .	18916.085690543725
accompanied by a violent yawn .	13637.93872720995
Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other .	9475.89221511754
But who was your mother ?	8402.041456876663
Then pray speak aloud .	13070.559258279189
but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent .	5594.920458724818
And when her sisters abused it as ugly , she added , with perfect unconcern , Oh !	5328.818541300255
But if I go on , I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem .	4870.46118585067
and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners , which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball .	4584.509138693351
when it became apparent , that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match .	4831.952456725923
and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance .	5371.772190596391
But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world , replied Darcy .	4677.807543321606
and added , that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage .	4989.734133088733
She highly approved his forbearance , and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other , as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn , and during the walk , he particularly attended to her .	4146.512863603436
True .	23252.575187015314
Bennet , through the assistance of servants , contrived to have the earliest tidings of it , that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side , might be as long as it could .	4444.193558745369
Indeed you are mistaken .	12196.137538334726
Lizzy , to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family !	5565.016580761915
Not a soul knew of it , but and Forster , and Kitty and me , except my aunt , for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns ;	4778.457180803486
From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage , it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew ;	5022.418568533795
That he was not a good-tempered man , had been her firmest opinion .	5786.317964827539
She longed to see Philips , the Lucases , and all their other neighbours , and to hear herself called Wickham , by each of them ;	4519.079597044392
Does your charge give you much trouble ?	10302.065429185526
It has been a very agreeable day , said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth .	5360.292211294446
Can I have the carriage ?	11170.220509330135
CHAPTER V Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth ;	5991.938801708213
at his own house especially , and of a Sunday evening when he has nothing to do .	6572.278046842167
When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance , and courting the good opinion of people , with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace ;	4657.892057580548
And that made the men suspect something , and then they soon found out what was the matter .	5323.794073815071
It must be something particular , to take him there at this time of year .	5083.318530592982
In what an amiable light does this place him !	7074.939562881399
The envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , hot pressed paper , well covered with a lady's fair , flowing hand ;	4893.395597400906
but the shortness of her stay , and yet more , the alteration of her manner , would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer .	4563.693569348125
Perhaps it would have been better ;	10091.850409105911
Have not you always hated him ?	10738.29991439579
but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence , what chance could there be of improvement ?	5420.053833477594
I am not now to learn , replied Collins , with a formal wave of the hand , that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first applies for their favour ;	3722.0305434896577
for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible .	6972.312736960158
The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming ;	4838.436520889869
Elizabeth , who was left by herself , now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled , that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation .	4190.152127428952
She could think of nothing else , and yet whether Bingley's regard had really died away , or were suppressed by his friends' interference ;	4237.057348838094
And she was only sixteen last June .	7796.496820654397
I think you said she was a widow , sir ?	5502.467166298864
Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine , who called out to know what they were talking of .	6114.396008738964
I do assure you , that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain .	4199.028521696432
Many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter ;	8025.187365805566
Lady Catherine , I have nothing farther to say .	5955.189702734418
and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible .	4091.6688299080774
yet there had been that in his voice , which was not like ease .	6929.77077458434
But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Darcy's pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers ;	4701.342014633097
He then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not tired , and they stood together on the lawn .	4754.570461036117
The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn .	6498.548876452876
Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these ;	8102.806395238213
Risk any thing rather than her displeasure ;	11054.153240613037
There was now an interest , however , in believing the housekeeper ;	5753.7423221223735
But his pride , his abominable pride , his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane , his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging , though he could not justify it , and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Wickham , his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny , soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited .	3948.4899201312937
They are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses ;	5313.6170639834845
Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's .	8717.053116004132
Well , I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Bingley .	5194.58060661932
No governess !	15432.223809528767
But our visitor was very obstinate .	8075.492646678731
As a clergyman , moreover , I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence ;	4801.8472212128745
When she is secure of him , there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses .	5209.653766767025
She had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses , which he had already had the honour of preaching before her .	4382.8422874637345
He drew a chair near her .	8298.224421540943
But whatever may be the sentiments which Wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character .	4759.202961497608
Georgiana's reception of them was very civil ;	11054.031130354546
Oh !	6826.5207498362
But how did he account for it ?	7176.531119703015
Bennet was really in a most pitiable state .	6995.135166625769
My father is gone to London , and Jane has written to beg my uncle's immediate assistance , and we shall be off , I hope , in half an hour .	4376.4195934039935
Mary was the only daughter who remained at home ;	8185.583706437458
It is not Bingley , said her husband ;	5154.909084014499
how unlucky !	18013.10724036334
Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as Elizabeth half expected Bingley to do , he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine's visit .	4774.159262142037
Do not copy , display , perform , distribute or redistribute this electronic work , or any part of this electronic work , without prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1 .	4247.3887098411715
But , whatever may be their own wishes , it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother's .	4713.521975280796
He then went away , and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself .	4541.625254745095
is she handsome ?	17103.64478316344
She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could , provided he chose with discretion ;	4431.312060993719
she knew not how to believe that Darcy could be so unworthy of Bingley's regard ;	6196.469483310977
I dare say you will find him very agreeable .	5639.992163839528
That is right .	9775.32487137474
and what can he have to say ?	6571.836908895152
His disposition must be dreadful .	9932.606850071577
But the fact is , that being , as I am , to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father , ( who , however , may live many years longer , ) I could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters , that the loss to them might be as little as possible , when the melancholy event takes place which , however , as I have already said , may not be for several years .	3743.916721172914
and you shall all have a bowl of punch , to make merry at her wedding .	4975.2790280385925
Till the next morning , however , she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance .	6179.128572937229
If you are a good girl for the next ten years , I will take you to a review at the end of them .	4587.775550450628
Elizabeth loved absurdities , but she had known Sir William's too long .	6269.809530556224
Women fancy admiration means more than it does .	10178.436969860899
Your's sincerely , c .	13793.400255143873
I shall offer to pay him to-morrow ;	5982.252215891733
said she .	12171.146619643097
But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Wickham , when she read with somewhat clearer attention , a relation of events , which , if true , must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself , her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition .	3929.4470260531216
Almost as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life .	6348.7555395122135
Oh !	6826.5207498362
and his sisters are charming women .	6699.257089858687
and will probably be much talked of .	7151.119251710705
and soon afterwards Darcy , drawing near Elizabeth , said to her Do not you feel a great inclination , Miss Bennet , to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel ?	4281.022966926602
I had not been long in Hertfordshire , before I saw , in common with others , that Bingley preferred your eldest sister , to any other young woman in the country .	4010.943331762521
It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again !	5846.457860388746
You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this .	4926.396926049439
The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed , the unacknowledged were silent .	6372.72806691619
Very true ;	16684.490706738623
I should be sorry to think so ill of him , in the very beginning of our relationship .	4029.062742128728
But on returning to the drawing-room , when her letter was finished , she saw , to her infinite surprise , there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her .	4379.040080643283
and Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected .	6496.702865785345
He then said , I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly .	5250.196649990412
four or five thousand a year .	11767.105934450643
they are all silly and ignorant like other girls ;	8128.134006210908
Collins was not a sensible man , and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society ;	5025.519210249425
I am going to open the instrument , Eliza , and you know what follows .	4245.272979856823
His fear of her , has always operated , I know , when they were together ;	5880.6612213312055
nor will I be dissuaded from it .	9631.556283863696
Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it , and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards ;	4753.783476505399
You have liked many a stupider person .	6637.482172402638
I will go to Meryton , said she , as soon as I am dressed , and tell the good , good news to my sister Philips .	3974.5562013971376
He brought it with him for us to see .	6974.955170522214
I have done with you from this very day .	5270.651687750228
and thither also went Wickham , undoubtedly by design ;	6496.702865785345
there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance !	7601.997797479334

Yet he knew to the contrary himself .	9847.072484464205
but that after their removal , it had been every where discussed ;	5766.468745976871
but since we see every day that where there is affection , young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune , from entering into engagements with each other , how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if I am tempted , or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist ?	4003.3318164347993
yes , his misfortunes have been great indeed .	8881.476840247638
she repented , though she hardly knew of what .	7803.459243300347
And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him , without any reason .	5209.971547570672
Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse , and that she could not leave her .	5071.23783162059
But people themselves alter so much , that there is something new to be observed in them for ever .	5213.9833252051485
Miss Darcy and her brother appeared , and this formidable introduction took place .	6196.170760683665
She related the subject of the pictures , the dimensions of the rooms , and the price of the furniture , in vain .	4938.4297684466255
Yes , all of them , I think .	6469.193481945362
If I was to go through the world , I could not meet with a better .	5319.547246442486
What , is he coming home , and without poor Lydia !	6604.61424285127
At our time of life , it is not so pleasant I can tell you , to be making new acquaintance every day ;	5232.553683251716
I would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ;	4461.90102004302
I talked about the dance , and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room , or the number of couples .	4576.90561419201
I had not thought Darcy so bad as this though I have never liked him , I had not thought so very ill of him I had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general , but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge , such injustice , such inhumanity as this !	3874.521101063834
E Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg : 1 .	7666.359704977354
and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn , they would be going there for ever .	4985.676611833166
As for the gentleman himself , his feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence .	4552.744476960338
inmates of the same house , sharing the same amusements , objects of the same parental care .	6689.083955578271
But what is to be done about Pemberley ?	6620.873457643633
In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage .	7074.939562881399
And men take care that they should .	8043.409692050659
Elizabeth accepted their company , and the three young ladies set off together .	5824.8069873797795
They may be modified and printed and given away you may do practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks .	5343.38159250235
Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball ;	4952.07196291215
She plays and sings all day long .	7593.425342730754
Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern .	7522.114640215476
The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl .	6372.72806691619
and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries , which Jane was equally eager to satisfy .	4542.808613073096
such an openness and gentleness in his manner .	9605.812541195057
The discomposure of spirits , which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into , could not be easily overcome ;	5342.5461318830685
Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages .	5947.059954702693
and even Jane , who believed still less of it , became almost hopeless , more especially as the time was now come , when if they had gone to Scotland , which she had never before entirely despaired of , they must in all probability have gained some news of them .	4027.0258259623774
But I wonder how long you would have gone on , if you had been left to yourself .	4681.2497694227695
You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you .	5281.443079563471
Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Collins , and I will never see you again if you do .	4546.2639929136385
whichever were the case , though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference , her sister's situation remained the same , her peace equally wounded .	5347.293945030259
To be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation , had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town ;	4946.680193753846
The possibility of Collins's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two ;	4714.179785635664
coaxed and threatened her by turns .	12171.203962187625
The housekeeper came ;	9654.248400518722
She was of great use and comfort to us all , and lady Lucas has been very kind ;	4658.056055497975
and I trust I am resigned .	5930.804042439338
Perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her .	7406.169369863415
if that is all , I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire ;	6178.648049959743
Not that I care about it , though .	7172.565418347659
Howsoever that may be , you are grievously to be pitied , in which opinion I am not only joined by Collins , but likewise by lady Catherine and her daughter , to whom I have related the affair .	4817.447273297163
Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public .	7192.867198303979
The comfort to her , of the regiment's approaching removal , was indeed beyond expression .	5679.552929626116
so easily guided that his worth was invaluable ;	8956.604116088587
his estate there is a noble one .	9767.695682389953
and as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together .	4302.651421756142
Wickham !	21275.543452277587
but Lydia , with perfect indifference , continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter , and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day , as he was going the next morning to London .	4201.860542988443
and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected .	5327.113125133025
No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph .	7329.889985045767
Assistance is impossible ;	18472.368653312184
They had , therefore , many acquaintance in common ;	6510.232060294899
To my fancy , it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men .	5827.493472155156
Bennet said only , Nonsense , nonsense !	8571.485715523355
But does not Jane correspond with the sister ?	7160.917178371429
I cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought , nor their offences against myself .	4563.68393840184
But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood , and take Pemberley for a kind of model .	4487.338306351865
Lord bless me !	17103.64478316344
till , roused to resentment by his subsequent language , she lost all compassion in anger .	6390.576802521762
How much you must have gone through !	7825.113465295335
Lady Catherine was a tall , large woman , with strongly-marked features , which might once have been handsome .	4918.722537175955
But , perhaps he could not in her mother's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt .	4511.184674363807
Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse .	9142.273828999563
Who would have thought she could be so thin and small !	6780.681944216696
And so was I You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner .	5333.261840113844
It is such a spur to one's genius , such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind .	4424.997574471228
That she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head .	6045.814199584794
it was impossible not to long to know .	6614.204631564067
She will drop the acquaintance entirely .	7149.280340722726
If you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits , and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment .	4118.249888810173
In the gallery there were many family portraits , but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger .	4942.14382936615
Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome ;	6807.477843505523
We will settle with your father about the money afterwards ;	6774.58168085182
Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment .	8250.601321568973
Bennet had no turn for economy , and her husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income .	5205.920705983893
He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him , nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity ;	4689.21702775321
and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time , than as she hoped that , by Caroline's not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him .	3923.583033560764
But when she read , and re-read with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu , so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate .	4107.113411859274
As for their mother , Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will , and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure , which astonished her husband and daughters .	4522.507587567657
The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough ;	6162.242380864301
The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors , and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife , was exactly what he had wished for ;	4456.130739172713
Teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind !	10178.436969860899
She would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions .	5749.80100877808
This will not do , said Elizabeth .	7646.121682510523
Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage , and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at Rosings .	5000.098816566741
He has the promise of an ensigncy in General 's regiment , now quartered in the North .	5033.476301977691
and covering her face with her handkerchief , Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else ;	5327.147893213468
It was a handsome modern building , well situated on rising ground .	4612.460542838049
Oh , brother , how kind you are !	6695.947845973628
But if you are really innocent and ignorant , I must be more explicit .	5116.495854606496
Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she ceased speaking , replied thus , My dear Miss Elizabeth , I have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding , but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity , and those which regulate the clergy ;	3944.4186625974253
That is exactly what I should have supposed of you , said Elizabeth .	5245.535275772059
If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is , I shall know what to think .	4712.603447801984
If she does not object to it , why should we ?	6486.162791949587
Having been frequently in company with him since her return , agitation was pretty well over ;	6555.262370163167
Philips visited them all , and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before .	6490.584510989043
Yours , c .	14283.895873050673
and so fervently did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets , which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity .	3959.2467658066084
Louisa , you will not mind my waking Hurst .	9223.445126070976
I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much , and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help .	3820.908414577629
but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on .	4909.546081336544
Thank you , Sir , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me .	6781.951725400419
I think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements .	5356.242107367847
shall I get you one ?	13637.93872720995
Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication .	4726.0590223024665
CHAPTER II .	11746.06741553873
If your master would marry , you might see more of him .	6265.68579925593
From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane , and were indebted to Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along , and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton , which he never failed coming to inform them of , though it happened almost every day .	4197.088200131919
With three younger sisters grown up , replied Elizabeth smiling , your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it .	5577.030854434764
and now , because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds , you want to find out that he is mercenary .	4435.413097352017
Elizabeth , at work in the opposite corner , saw it all with great delight .	5166.463721243222
We now come to the point .	9268.277503100222
Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone ;	6348.609681848598
It had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought to be imitated , though it could not be equalled , by some exertion of politeness on their side ;	3895.0605248644865
Collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed .	6316.020163556834
If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set forth in this agreement , you must obtain permission in writing from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael Hart , the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark .	3530.9719769990897
The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions .	5554.601278606063
He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt's , where his regret and vexation , and the concern of every body was well talked over .	4614.319097294621
These causes must be stated , though briefly .	9073.822579829268
A little time therefore .	10579.394152156274
I did not wink at you .	5672.824823991223
Some people call him proud ;	12342.318502566179
Darcy only smiled ;	12647.583104046094
and Collins have a comfortable income , but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance .	4200.4186739090765
Elizabeth particularly , who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy , was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied .	4453.63727253471
I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun .	5020.086423815833
for in a quarter of an hour's t te- -t te with Bennet before breakfast , a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house , and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes , that a mistress for it might be found at Longbourn , produced from her , amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement , a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on .	4062.5258978277147
nor will such behaviour as this , ever induce me to be explicit .	6984.5688620242245
Upon my word , Sir , cried Elizabeth , your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration .	5059.480242343717
Gardiner was a sensible , gentleman-like man , greatly superior to his sister , as well by nature as education .	5458.275683542143
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly .	7254.174979708635
You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles , for you are wasting your time with me .	5014.233549390312
though I thought it would be very good fun if I was .	6565.6200734525855
Who is to fight Wickham , and make him marry her , if he comes away ?	6404.932251558175
She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country .	4890.596698755209
Bennet treated the matter differently .	10097.170474026754
Follies and nonsense , whims and inconsistencies do divert me , I own , and I laugh at them whenever I can .	5952.864167939667
Gardiner abused her stupidity .	12011.46636252956
You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine , but which I have never acknowledged .	5230.559899905653
His character is thereby complete .	9139.10965194751
and Miss Lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon that establishment were gained .	4605.367497517576
but Sir William's good breeding carried him through it all ;	6578.204573564382
My youngest sister has left all her friends has eloped ;	7003.125801292079
I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments ;	5154.878253381987
and without any intention of coming back again .	6598.9656412604045
and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments .	5923.530234020949
They will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to Longbourn ;	5738.32901278107
Elizabeth looked archly , and turned away .	7225.057228591699
I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world , and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns .	4062.4371549275616
But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed , so doubtful , so indefinite , that it gives me very little idea .	4727.9080210739985
A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request , without waiting for arguments to reason one into it .	5160.534762874886
so handsome !	18193.912977931544
The dinner too in its turn was highly admired ;	6595.882350026293
CHAPTER XVII .	11746.06741553873
one knows exactly what to think .	10644.175420793192
Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure ;	7196.221615094885
It was a rational scheme to be sure !	4855.833855637269
though her spirits are greatly shaken .	10007.671765641913
As they passed through the hall , Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and drawing-room , and pronouncing them , after a short survey , to be decent looking rooms , walked on .	4463.927663984941
CHAPTER V I have been thinking it over again , Elizabeth , said her uncle , as they drove from the town ;	5231.3903469914
Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane .	7077.6456431077795
She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage , and had a few minutes' conversation with Charlotte , but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out .	4779.224959792
But he had given a reason for his interference , which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief .	5084.563813194617
But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted .	4782.579963570816
and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself , is heightened into something still more interesting , from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister .	4163.69747402318
Upon this information , they instantly passed through the hall once more , and ran across the lawn after their father , who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock .	4651.101915329629
and Gardiner smiled .	9413.518382091375
Do not you want to know who has taken it ?	6321.988091666677
While they were dressing , he came two or three times to their different doors , to recommend their being quick , as Lady Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner .	4807.266142321178
and as soon as they were in the parlour , he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode , and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment .	3861.5510911179513
He was directly invited to join their party , but he declined it , observing , that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together , with either of which motives his joining them would interfere .	4015.7827771241055
pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before .	8901.060544562486
I am sorry to say it of them , but so it is .	4005.126785999451
Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat , he suddenly addressed her with , I hope Bingley will like it Lizzy .	5843.737962653644
1 .	12212.55279990698
There is one point , on which I want your advice .	5982.677881677511
They then sat down , and when her enquiries after Rosings were made , seemed in danger of sinking into total silence .	5099.462408384942
I assure you , Madam , he replied , that she does not need such advice .	4483.541261166788
Her answer , therefore , was not propitious , at least not to Elizabeth's wishes , for she was impatient to get home .	5085.200632265494
Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to Miss Darcy , without calling her attention .	4423.960273681325
They both set off , and the conjectures of the remaining three continued , though with little satisfaction , till the door was thrown open , and their visitor entered .	4580.486781369602
I mend pens remarkably well .	8206.702495836793
He does not want abilities .	8342.045204945081
and though prepared , as he told Elizabeth , to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house , he was used to be free from them there ;	4167.600009026215
My situation in life , my connections with the family of De Bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ;	4885.824364632083
In Meryton they parted ;	10809.147138626455
You do not know what he really is ;	6505.427524587839
and , before she could reply , he added , It is above eight months .	4647.760874745492
We are each of an unsocial , taciturn disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room , and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb .	4406.04057126595
and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother , when they were met by the butler , who said , If you are looking for my master , ma'am , he is walking towards the little copse .	4053.2318977119508
whence , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods overspreading many , and occasionally part of the stream .	4701.349232651871
I know you will contrive it all .	5537.987347384816
Their manner of living , even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home , was unsettled in the extreme .	5418.172961501652
Oh , lord !	8412.633737715443
but when the living fell , it was given elsewhere .	5838.577662940699
the morning in bustle and shopping , and the evening at one of the theatres .	6337.705010600638
The wedding took place ;	9730.085984318766
These are conditions , which , considering every thing , I had no hesitation in complying with , as far as I thought myself privileged , for you .	5027.770027164956
No aunt , no officers , no news could be sought after ;	6747.948871829573
but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity .	4642.200741512115
cried Bingley .	16370.179325817406
We want none of them ;	10130.96629713281
cried Elizabeth .	9945.194991360355
Sir William , how can you tell such a story ?	7155.176346783097
Yes ;	11624.632075734577
How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate !	5542.94251610841
She longed to speak , but could think of nothing to say ;	5661.595438532398
But the clothes , the wedding clothes !	6595.554100548565
Bennet and her daughters then departed , and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane , leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Darcy ;	4594.490782791472
Do not imagine , Miss Bennet , that your ambition will ever be gratified .	5437.804057010034
we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster's .	6983.338469649558
How humiliating is this discovery !	10018.264451649171
and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage ;	5659.368867412334
but I do not think there would have been any fun in it .	4962.696804699141
It is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us .	4988.688141856221
Not one party , or scheme , or any thing .	6966.962345088765
He replied , and was again silent .	7761.9054287946265
So far each recital confirmed the other : but when she came to the will , the difference was great .	5881.717669212068
I dare say Bingley will be very glad to see you ;	5203.390064866876
Here you are in your own family .	9847.072484464205
Since her father's death , her home has been London , where a lady lives with her , and superintends her education .	5678.501762383059
Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire , paid his compliments , with his usual reserve , to Collins ;	4575.583424381869
Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter , Darcy must speak for himself .	5566.47243924295
You are a gentleman's daughter .	6934.186249764598
I do not recollect that we did .	4703.705814242992
As soon as they were gone , Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits ;	5258.255704631116
and have such tremblings , such flutterings , all over me , such spasms in my side , and pains in my head , and such beatings at heart , that I can get no rest by night nor by day .	4248.493822671395
Jane shook her head .	11218.754920138075
Upon my word I say no more here than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood , except Netherfield .	5015.305314132652
You are quite a visit in my debt , Bingley , she added , for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us , as soon as you returned .	4136.406731226933
for , by the bye , you are to understand , that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them .	4737.997599823638
but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation .	4584.6365485146425
Let me know every thing that I am to know , without delay .	6146.651801001357
Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him , but this step ( and let us rejoice over it ) marks nothing bad at heart .	5651.731197025931
Yes , replied Darcy , who could contain himself no longer , but that was only when I first knew her , for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance .	4187.23141648629
I ask only a comfortable home ;	7640.735496563357
I certainly shall not .	8158.9378625850795
I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us .	5008.483495087754
When they get to our age I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do .	5240.5171231341255
Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine , was in a different style ;	7793.406329326233
and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it .	4662.67175670323
Bennet was doubly engaged , on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane , who sat some way below her , and on the other , retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases ;	4346.967181971389
Charlotte had seen them from her husband's room , crossing the road , and immediately running into the other , told the girls what an honour they might expect , adding , I may thank you , Eliza , for this piece of civility .	4535.962592913489
It has been coming on so gradually , that I hardly know when it began .	5144.44756390947
she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression .	6929.386545192131
yes the handsomest young lady that ever was seen ;	8572.467775143969
It is not that I do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman's of superior execution .	4337.389906177362
How much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow !	5931.46149784321
Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance , mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste .	5184.135512440942
My aunt Philips wants you so to get husbands , you can't think .	5850.160767394773
It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next , and a still greater , that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again , and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits , by all that affection could do .	3802.1966286833404
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood , this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families , that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters .	4419.700894913504
Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified , never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting .	5427.989020767065
Next to being married , a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then .	6293.335656854486
Make haste , and come down this moment .	10178.436969860899
Now I have got some news for you , said Lydia , as they sat down to table .	5432.7809771199045
what has she to do with it ?	9767.695682389953
Its windows opening to the ground , admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house , and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn .	4849.8089372074
That is to say , you had given your permission .	6222.59591506637
One may be continually abusive without saying any thing just ;	7919.130814510194
no it is not for me to be driven away by Darcy .	7098.541505078181
There was now employment for the whole party ;	6641.776264359548
The expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity .	5554.601278606063
I shall certainly try to get the better .	5755.471279591442
She read over her aunt's commendation of him again and again .	6171.570798143824
How is half such a sum to be repaid ?	7356.144881723775
and depend upon it , Bingley never stirs without him .	5646.307925504636
we are all in an uproar .	11106.934745442433
If , in the explanation of them which is due to myself , I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your's , I can only say that I am sorry .	4478.579229178603
Wont it , Kitty ?	15633.167043926136
Oh !	6826.5207498362
This accounted to Elizabeth for Wickham's being among them .	7610.466522150306
I shall now know how to act .	5982.252215891733
I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of the covies for you .	3907.6166919661537
Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister , that they did not once sit down to a family dinner .	4878.936487733233
But I shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity of your sister's countenance and air was such , as might have given the most acute observer , a conviction that , however amiable her temper , her heart was not likely to be easily touched .	3950.7159757582867
Who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly !	5390.324579861511
He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place , and his intrigues , all honoured with the title of seduction , had been extended into every tradesman's family .	4239.976696655217
Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment ;	6467.630275750279
But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being withheld from seeing Jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless .	3961.2032281412125
CHAPTER VIII .	13083.650239159624
Long said so too , for I asked her whether you did not .	7400.109143036231
E8 .	26953.136861511783
That is very strange .	8226.293352790364
Oh !	6826.5207498362
It was a subject which they could not mention before me .	4689.417662739879
But when you have had time to think it all over , I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done .	4508.492030648146
and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits ;	4484.484702414841
That is a question which Darcy only can answer .	5851.327539908974
You were not by , when I told mamma , and the others , all about it .	5352.128684032053
When Darcy returned to the saloon , Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister .	4881.474274754321
But that is one great difference between us .	6516.047397501867
Her mother stepped forwards , embraced her , and welcomed her with rapture ;	6114.063955829491
The express was sent off directly .	8198.419983139142
Could he expect that her friends would not step forward ?	7460.739610672947
Darcy !	14999.807558074162
and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature , by the testimony so highly in his favour , and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light , which yesterday had produced .	4001.023275115092
It is impossible for me to be impartial .	5261.8778138867665
Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love ;	5991.850406358478
But vanity , not love , has been my folly .	6543.624494085479
His understanding and opinions all please me ;	7942.115691483942
When the party broke up , Lydia returned with Forster to Meryton , from whence they were to set out early the next morning .	4798.010047527095
and she spoke very little , except in a low voice , to Jenkinson , in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable , and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said , and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes .	3890.935197421441
but he soon afterwards said , I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month .	4895.817857018175
and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise , and owned she encouraged it as much as possible .	4293.637274204301
Yes , very different .	8053.710211770907
Jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening .	5213.223393268941
She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue , while in town , for the recovery of his daughter .	4531.424747262966
A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth ;	5845.908022844721
Jones says we must not think of moving her .	9475.89221511754
Why does she not come in ?	10091.246746470533
By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure ;	7817.234704401502
And that is quite impossible ;	8794.429523835868
An hour , however , saw the whole completed ;	8639.880134611527
Her sisters were uneasy for her , but her mother was delighted .	6555.922367737725
or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour .	5850.182642445488
You must decide for yourself , said Elizabeth , and if upon mature deliberation , you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife , I advise you by all means to refuse him .	4086.960428633685
and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions .	4995.2865540272405
after going over so many , she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains .	6572.278046842167
Very few days passed in which Collins did not walk to Rosings , and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise ;	5137.4643834614735
Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject ;	6764.820135102227
CHAPTER XV .	11746.06741553873
Never , even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield , or his dignified relations at Rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from self-consequence , or unbending reserve as now , when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed , would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings .	4046.0676583128998
He has given in all his debts ;	6683.721262539767
CHAPTER VII .	11746.06741553873
Shall you like to have such a brother ?	9410.53611545541
Oh !	6826.5207498362
Your affectionate friend , LYDIA BENNET .	9592.198410293624
Did it , said he , did it soon make you think better of me ?	6537.346163490086
she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library .	7419.585067681512
However , he wrote some verses on her , and very pretty they were .	6619.5919998012
and at length , by repeated assurances that Darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the test of many months suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father's incredulity , and reconcile him to the match .	3819.9632293398668
It is more than I engage for , I assure you .	4635.46054815609
He walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very great !	5745.081854380195
As soon as they entered the copse , Lady Catherine began in the following manner : You can be at no loss , Miss Bennet , to understand the reason of my journey hither .	4235.57795162301
To his tacit engagement with Miss De Bourgh ?	7883.694717896779
Elizabeth , having rather expected to affront him , was amazed at his gallantry ;	5269.405434419472
But at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went sorely against the grain ;	4242.938087815423
What a pity it is , mamma , we did not all go .	5916.382550842939
But Bennet , was not so well pleased with it .	6109.560704008003
Tell me once for all , are you engaged to him ?	7896.044134944185
What a good joke it will be !	7556.903383245543
Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her .	6654.556216992507
and as they entered the house , he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men ;	4245.032365372545
and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary .	4884.021486209623
He would scarcely be ten pounds a-year the loser , by the hundred that was to be paid them ;	5282.401556062475
If such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy !	5682.935260729083
Jane , who was not so light , nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth , soon lagged behind , while her sister , panting for breath , came up with him , and eagerly cried out , Oh , Papa , what news ?	4341.745720577949
said Elizabeth .	14806.870074320834
I shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on .	5042.235718771566
He had never had the slightest suspicion .	6648.417067146408
But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him , as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage ?	4557.03936961398
and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley , which might only grieve her sister farther .	4329.858280578101
He sat down for a few moments , and then getting up walked about the room .	5060.32739372655
Elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well ;	4732.560654382418
Her daughter , Miss de Bourgh , will have a very large fortune , and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates .	4809.721770885897
And we mean to treat you all , added Lydia ;	6702.696403897979
for he is now in the custody of his friend , and Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London !	4579.630495768224
Pursuing her way along the lane , she then began it .	8422.955776328197
She was disappointed , and angry with herself for being so .	5251.308643762917
She had been unwilling to mention Bingley ;	5818.488492430975
He is , indeed .	7844.062682841279
He was exactly what he had been , when I knew him in Hertfordshire ;	5010.442971333705
How can Bingley , who seems good humour itself , and is , I really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ?	4789.898658290128
She has a very good notion of fingering , though her taste is not equal to Anne's .	5093.649607273957
Haye-Park might do , said she , if the Gouldings would quit it , or the great house at Stoke , if the drawing-room were larger ;	5497.403824948603
We were born in the same parish , within the same park , the greatest part of our youth was passed together ;	5126.293798965517
CHAPTER II .	11746.06741553873
but with respect to any other leading characteristic , I do not imagine that much has been unfolded .	5083.198251292174
When you told Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes , you meant it to be a sort of panegyric , of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone , and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else ?	4057.2840036236976
for to her inexpressible vexation , she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Darcy , who sat opposite to them .	5042.309146107851
It is wonderful , replied Wickham , for almost all his actions may be traced to pride ;	4695.52707392073
At length , however , our kind friend procured the wished-for direction .	5382.063276900738
I think I have heard you say , that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton .	4511.719915721066
advice , which there was every reason to believe would be attended to ;	7674.886508350777
Elizabeth looked surprised .	9994.395603205006
I do not cough for my own amusement , replied Kitty fretfully .	4326.5515954565
To Rosings he then hastened to console Lady Catherine , and her daughter ;	6358.112711353171
I am astonished , said Miss Bingley , that my father should have left so small a collection of books .	3995.226404288202
I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly .	5920.766674440183
I was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off , and then I should have gone quite distracted .	4369.464754901403
they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money , great connections , and pride .	5768.556247116267
he continued after a pause , on seeing Bingley join the group ;	6927.301709794452
and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin .	4690.010588887193
Of this she was perfectly unaware ;	10350.730990889175
'Tis too much !	17658.907085145383
Not a syllable was uttered by either ;	8110.528060379341
Your's , very sincerely , M GARDINER .	9225.944264296211
Collins had a compliment , and an allusion to throw in here , which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter .	5285.307314727125
I have not the pleasure of understanding you , said he , when she had finished her speech .	3816.6626588414324
But these things happen so often !	7622.432493940244
The suspicions which had just arisen of Darcy and their niece , directed their observation towards each with an earnest , though guarded , enquiry ;	4850.096284702185
and quitting them both , he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton , denominated from that period Lucas Lodge , where he could think with pleasure of his own importance , and unshackled by business , occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world .	4079.877297494055
I have not the smallest objection to explaining them , said he , as soon as she allowed him to speak .	3876.4338656516084
F3 , a full refund of any money paid for a work or a replacement copy , if a defect in the electronic work is discovered and reported to you within <TIME_PERIOD > of receipt of the work .	4551.295287589205
but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal , that her mother , though often disheartened , had never yet despaired of succeeding at last .	4414.756767879969
He was quite young , wonderfully handsome , extremely agreeable , and to crown the whole , he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party .	4336.566314455006
Such relief , however , as it was in her power to afford , by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences , she frequently sent them .	4768.206865895955
It was to be such a secret !	5859.054157689969
and if he is disposed to make them any amends , I shall not be the person to discourage him .	4472.637421913334
His wish of introducing his sister to her , was a compliment of the highest kind .	5880.5844603162905
Again she read on .	15012.190929676433
Will you tell me how long you have loved him ?	7848.338153328741
After discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , Miss Lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight ;	4021.325320023025
Yes , and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise .	5424.430051165419
I never heard that it was .	5627.28357529198
they are certainly not gone to Scotland .	8324.298648057746
for it gratified him , he said , to discover that Charlotte Lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter !	4436.14672696824
I did not expect such a compliment .	5296.064393194727
Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other , and the waiter was told that he need not stay .	5389.073703638105
She watched him whenever they were at Rosings , and whenever he came to Hunsford ;	5641.908233234851
Their party in the dining-room was large , for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news : and various were the subjects which occupied them ;	4910.947047428783
and if we were beyond the hour , we could not be married all day .	4839.920854233113
My dear Madam , replied he , let us be for ever silent on this point .	4948.646796734518
But when the gentlemen entered , Jane was no longer the first object .	5472.557926848325
Of what are you talking ?	11015.207101833752
We have heard only once .	8517.359130031815
With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn , and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart .	5080.002046391105
It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl , whom he was violently in love with only a few days before .	4297.978766042499
It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her .	4400.357495896969
Has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style ?	7376.871705662011
he merely answered her question , and read on .	7949.127924732418
If we make haste , said Lydia , as they walked along , perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes .	4867.671373460382
Elizabeth read on ;	11291.257087305366
You will be a very happy woman .	6559.024592513528
the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers' wives , and Elizabeth continued her walk alone , crossing field after field at a quick pace , jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity , and finding herself at last within view of the house , with weary ancles , dirty stockings , and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise .	4126.685735570096
But as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you .	5509.603282576145
Two obstacles of the five being thus removed , Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time , without making any impression on them .	5182.118820227694
but this would be nothing if you really liked him .	6212.234154346529
yes .	21381.54935835586
and really , upon serious consideration , I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter .	4453.22344959566
and her mother was too happy , to be quite so obstinate as usual .	4942.451284020575
though I am sure ( and I do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it , ) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole .	4688.58854643246
and till the evening after the visit was paid , she had no knowledge of it .	4975.279116591161
It is no such thing .	6110.076631003295
Excellent Parsonage House !	18472.368653312184
I hope you have destroyed the letter .	6003.234783383046
She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings , and had sent for him only the Saturday before , to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening .	4099.82041077377
I am sure there is not on his .	4295.971495267902
I am sure we never read the same , or not with the same feelings .	4005.250904887612
Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast .	5797.125111781526
Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them .	6940.317729881633
She felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Wickham , and rejoiced in it .	4957.127794456425
Oh , no !	9205.692046869573
And taking her hand , he would have given it to Darcy , who , though extremely surprised , was not unwilling to receive it , when she instantly drew back , and said with some discomposure to Sir William , Indeed , Sir , I have not the least intention of dancing .	4187.03285422346
She certainly did not hate him .	8103.270527315195
Had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it ;	6592.959026261381
The rapture of Lydia on this occasion , her adoration of Forster , the delight of Bennet , and the mortification of Kitty , are scarcely to be described .	4669.803586596513
I wonder my aunt did not tell us of that .	5756.88566302132
Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage , and when it drove off , Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house .	5141.693700033073
Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , Jane and Kitty followed , but Lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could ;	4772.804299733736
No one made any reply .	9654.084459599431
Bennet wondered at their coming , and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble , and was sure Jane would have caught cold again .	4957.113796457452
and the consciousness of this , was another reason for his resolving to follow us .	4771.87319686211
Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity ?	6993.9407794424715
But with such a father and mother , and such low connections , I am afraid there is no chance of it .	4850.683534225427
she has got over the most trying age .	8030.653205524012
the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment ;	5574.914046720215
I think I have heard you say that you know them .	4869.144245214657
but his cousin , after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Collins , sat for some time without speaking to any body .	4302.822102645015
and on this account , as well as some others , found herself , when their visitors left them , capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction , though while it was passing , the enjoyment of it had been little .	4065.2981604369315
If Elizabeth , when Darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of its contents .	4683.532095054816
Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours , he had yielded to his brother-in-law's intreaty that he would return to his family , and leave it to him to do , whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit .	4701.362735505299
You may , in fact , carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire , my dear cousin .	4880.733180478304
hopeless of seeing him before .	13637.93872720995
I will put on my things in a moment .	5252.2351310021495
Yours , c .	14283.895873050673
You are a good girl ;	6934.276776753056
As soon as they entered , Bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information ;	4437.007320645372
but his perfect indifference , and your pointed dislike , make it so delightfully absurd !	5171.712692146428
Will you hear it ?	12781.57848475241
Society , I own , is necessary to me .	9223.356823723107
I hope not .	7648.024971039671
Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had originated in jealousy , she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her , and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady's side , the acquaintance would now be renewed .	4378.03822576829
Not the slightest .	13678.530305987924
This was a lucky recollection it saved her from something like regret .	5847.722369442054
but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation .	7204.1816963830615
How strange must it appear to him !	8072.8435037680765
She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man , who , in disposition and talents , would most suit her .	4802.343916734942
I must beg to return to the house .	5609.381000453748
Why , indeed , he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head , as you will hear .	5333.924202099525
On his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him , which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said , Did not you think , Darcy , that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when I was teazing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton ?	4035.630104039502
Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter .	7126.256013213425
The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat , drink , and sleep , and pursue the usual course of their employments .	4773.277080823089
They had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister .	5865.316576226505
She found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable .	5663.714043496354
I congratulate her .	9929.439968236367
In such cases , a woman has not often much beauty to think of .	6011.425503738405
After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity , Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday .	4964.329894617291
There , Bennet .	12135.108874826783
It appears to me so very unlikely , that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless , and who was actually staying in his colonel's family , that I am strongly inclined to hope the best .	4155.689908734606
for , besides the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her .	5975.855407471384
Yes , replied Wickham ;	7959.407636954033
I will have no reserves from you .	6003.698011300485
And now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be ;	5387.96084385423
My aunt , she continued , is going to-morrow into that part of the town , and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor-street .	4798.64774364862
You give me fresh life and vigour .	7858.324534396429
I say no more than the truth , and what every body will say that knows him , replied the other .	4937.2845895397595
Her keenest attention was awakened ;	9807.29913675854
She really looked almost wild .	8750.12651669961
Miss De Bourgh was pale and sickly ;	8674.992983717359
Consoled by this resolution , she was the better able to bear her husband's incivility ;	7118.298473943141
There is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us .	5396.42483323533
He is his own master .	7285.689057247088
We live in so different a part of town , all our connections are so different , and , as you well know , we go out so little , that it is very improbable they should meet at all , unless he really comes to see her .	4295.459944420971
I should like it beyond any thing !	5785.056396802052
You shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased .	5515.7766635076905
Lady Catherine de Bourgh , she replied , has very lately given him a living .	5108.88165119041
My courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me .	7003.1886572305575
I wish you had been there .	5427.434956296152
But to be guarded at such a time , is very difficult .	5522.875342195515
He is perfectly amiable .	7844.062682841279
Why , he has four or five thousand a-year , and very likely more .	6068.626823427647
Have you any other objection , said Elizabeth , than your belief of my indifference ?	6124.567816585762
told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her's , and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry .	5283.952577975075
Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth ;	8249.813547170183
He was resolutely silent however ;	7002.125856881211
How can you be smiling so , Lizzy ?	6828.113907458792
who could have done less for her ?	9936.584974667936
The person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund .	4893.395597400906
Well , Lizzy , continued her mother soon afterwards , and so the Collinses live very comfortable , do they ?	4884.126889420983
These parties were acceptable to all ;	10644.5571306853
Upon the whole , therefore , she found , what has been sometimes found before , that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire , did not in taking place , bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself .	4404.995440737425
she made a slight , formal , apology , for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was in every respect so altered a creature , that when she went away , I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer .	4274.932216636858
Gardiner , highly amused by the kind of family prejudice , to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master , soon led again to the subject ;	4852.078033331174
If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield , said Bennet to her husband , and all the others equally well married , I shall have nothing to wish for .	4285.258582164485
It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case .	4337.702284103576
Had he done his duty in that respect , Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle , for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her .	4885.718176602007
and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton .	4727.929514711245
He had some intention , he added , of studying the law , and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein .	4344.048204213545
Lord !	24005.26131005713
I am not equal to it .	4650.136786037583
Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch-street , and repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and herself , which proved that the former had , from her heart , given up the acquaintance .	4557.08616309512
His reception however was of the most flattering kind .	7510.187043349958
Bennet's eyes sparkled .	14688.846394682172
My aunt's intelligence had given me hope , and I was determined at once to know every thing .	5547.781530790592
I cannot think of it without abhorrence .	5798.611803604592
When she was discontented she fancied herself nervous .	7149.215703863611
Yours ever , CAROLINE BINGLEY .	12805.416551947083
I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time .	4674.924154077964
but it will have no effect on me .	6239.3327020288725
and between her and Gardiner , with occasional help from Elizabeth , the conversation was carried on .	5229.502501769614
I must go instantly to my mother ;	6193.355548148088
He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while .	5898.54855496496
I cannot pretend to be sorry , said Wickham , after a short interruption , that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts ;	4282.227856179693
A man who had felt less , might .	7363.036104199978
B Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark .	10385.899428949226
and when at last Kitty did , she very innocently said , What is the matter mamma ?	4639.368448382019
If my vanity had taken a musical turn , you would have been invaluable , but as it is , I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers .	4387.03373941414
She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together ;	4763.015868222322
She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity , nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct .	4658.028183725354
I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country for my part , except the shops and public places .	4411.9689227909075
but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough .	5940.195509773339
my dear , said Maria quite shocked at the mistake , it is not Lady Catherine .	5643.327490020106
When she was only fifteen , there was a gentleman at my brother Gardiner's in town , so much in love with her , that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away .	4288.6179900834
He had to be sure done much .	6648.417067146408
Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback , and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day .	4884.790171342153
But now suppose as much as you chuse ;	6173.212314550095
Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Darcy's progress through his book , as in reading her own ;	5266.629809281893
for Mary , on receiving amongst the thanks of the table , the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute began another .	4550.916251308099
The advice was followed readily , for the feverish symptoms increased , and her head ached acutely .	5442.917329673097
Letters of business too !	15633.167043926136
he was to come there with Wickham , you know .	6923.0387015800325
Can you come to-morrow ?	12195.61324814937
And my aunt Philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good , added Kitty .	4868.9508460743455
No , Lizzy , let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame .	5023.7892797985
I never heard of such a thing .	5423.347617474688
Are you , indeed ?	11156.977942746094
Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther , and when he ceased , the colour rose into her cheeks , and she said , In such cases as this , it is , I believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however unequally they may be returned .	4195.964255637853
What advantage can it be to you to offend Darcy ?	7178.506570286005
and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again , which I should think exceedingly probable , stay quietly at home , and be satisfied that we shall take no offence .	3971.9064377098966
Miss Bingley saw all this likewise ;	7471.401166150361
Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me , because it would be imprudent ;	7118.347151727821
said Miss Bingley ;	12923.1656083358
But his anger , I am persuaded , lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister's sentiments .	4984.829267801809
I knew enough of your disposition to be certain , that , had you been absolutely , irrevocably decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine , frankly and openly .	4244.88003072486
From such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink .	7098.823830915868
Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness .	5654.728282817089
This was exactly as it should be ;	7529.333168372893
Secondly , that I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness ;	7377.774677769735
It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he should .	4909.630170996711
They are young in the ways of the world , and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on , as well as the plain .	4317.88596593907
With the Gardiners , they were always on the most intimate terms .	6535.197968186785
She had a sister married to a Philips , who had been a clerk to their father , and succeeded him in the business , and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade .	4093.6668169755567
Never , sir .	14882.342733784842
Dear Lizzy !	20869.11113949553
How near it may be to mine , I cannot pretend to say .	6419.801945180375
for as the others were all going to sit down to cards , she could not be wanted to counteract her mother's schemes .	4986.947526376088
Elizabeth had received none since her return , that could come from Pemberley .	5585.335273093276
Jane was as much gratified by this , as her mother could be , though in a quieter way .	5298.372667751034
The officers of the shire were in general a very creditable , gentleman-like set , and the best of them were of the present party ;	4663.557310260866
It has been my own doing , and I ought to feel it .	5360.292211294446
Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face , and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections .	4740.474944542668
She explained what its effect on her had been , and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed .	5141.673109619182
CHAPTER XVIII .	13083.650239159624
No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth , and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful .	5412.209611448069
Your's , c .	10483.694660383553
You must and shall be married by a special licence .	5714.7001890782485
But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them .	4701.408104679934
nor , when we attempt to describe any particular scene , will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation .	6006.3576694244575
In this manner Lady Catherine talked on , till they were at the door of the carriage , when turning hastily round , she added , I take no leave of you , Miss Bennet .	4307.659717545691
and Elizabeth , agitated and confused , rather knew that she was happy , than felt herself to be so ;	4403.3798960419135
If I had ever learnt , I should have been a great proficient .	5567.834025255077
She is quite a little creature .	6545.702371646106
Bingley does not know Wickham himself ?	8647.61936014382
I would not trust you so near it as East Bourne for fifty pounds !	4973.004244485964
He shall not be in love with me , if I can prevent it .	5745.081854380195
I did not expect it from you .	5296.122897082079
But in matters of greater weight , I may suffer from the want of money .	5271.3173107195935
I came to you without a doubt of my reception .	5967.511445777036
Indeed I could not .	11589.105305883535
This is wholly unexpected .	9264.003228282012
and when they parted , after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield , and embracing her most tenderly , she even shook hands with the former .	3995.627235848119
My watchfulness has been effectual ;	9621.838811655196
c .	29757.454875608575
You may readily comprehend , she added , what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and ( comparatively speaking ) a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time .	4089.0751401402968
That would be the greatest misfortune of all !	7594.945187615917
And so ended his affection , said Elizabeth impatiently .	6507.766210336466
Against staying longer , however , Elizabeth was positively resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked ;	6348.609681848598
Thank you but I always mend my own .	8858.253867070787
cried Elizabeth .	9945.194991360355
But the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me .	4548.847758547751
Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt's arrival .	7451.971583331172
Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more , and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly , there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity .	4466.830244821284
and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of Lord , how tired I am !	4759.371326293385
She does not yet leave her dressing-room .	7593.425342730754
for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming .	6352.241619580909
Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Bingley .	6184.723370914207
but she found herself considerably useful to both of them , in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur .	4688.960942508352
If there were any one , that one could apply to , with a probability of gaining such a clue as that , it might be of essential consequence .	4626.137756540325
but , however , I hope it is not true .	5298.0177477096695
I am sorry it went off .	4690.864718920444
Charles , when you build your house , I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley .	6509.612953215
She had gained her point , and had time to consider of it .	5131.122950756666
said Elizabeth , still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam .	8224.624794548345
and in his behaviour to me , there were stronger impulses even than pride .	4855.2988965541035
Darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said , This walk is not wide enough for our party .	5767.547690563975
She did not choose it , said her daughter , she would go .	5537.237176529634
dear , yes ;	17658.907085145383
I declare I do not know a more aweful object than Darcy , on particular occasions , and in particular places ;	4864.13349818087
he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton .	7549.356219097958
But why all this secrecy ?	8185.258925222511
for he would certainly think the better of me , if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat denial , and ride off as fast as I could .	4613.8306905985
but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement .	4831.956812178701
That is all settled .	7725.321051252299
As the day of his arrival drew near , I begin to be sorry that he comes at all , said Jane to her sister .	4970.454595744653
I wish I could see her .	5411.140651023945
We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance .	5724.121498576118
The colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ;	4904.063245454288
But now that my dear uncle is come , I hope every thing will be well .	5172.822341163243
But , Lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or Jane at most .	4673.08467985179
You had better neglect your relations , than run the risk of offending your patroness .	5469.25193974632
His pride never deserts him ;	9326.275084967354
Yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the t te- -t te was over .	5384.287313119712
but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty .	5420.053833477594
Every park has its beauty and its prospects ;	8668.008650146021
It is , in short , impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them , without actual blame on either side .	4236.281816015149
Oh !	6826.5207498362
She then sat still five minutes longer ;	6660.853837813405
When the dancing recommenced , however , and Darcy approached to claim her hand , Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence .	4151.205357949039
Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ;	6905.956349608649
every sister except Mary agreed to go with her ;	8914.628507904577
You see on what a footing we are .	7414.3898972737015
There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds .	6192.29946002507
and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion .	4498.283500262174
she only smiles , I laugh .	9548.108779207316
Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman , not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Bennet .	5288.45775212201
Bennet indeed said little ;	11231.635932287329
Bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county ;	6831.635058405064
Wickham's affection for Lydia , was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it ;	6929.77077458434
Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings ;	9475.89221511754
It is really too distressing .	6507.312774570377
Jane recollected herself soon , and putting the letter away , tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation ;	5364.699271740326
but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures , every idea gave way to the charm of recollection ;	4766.358950905585
How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it !	5198.649010691922
It had better have happened to you , Lizzy ;	6392.703256389821
coming frequently before breakfast , and always remaining till after supper ;	8422.884624479988
Gardiner , who was walking arm in arm with Elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of her wonder .	5293.538250343312
Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once .	6635.703472634716
I hoped to find you reasonable ;	7640.735496563357
and I can never be in company with this Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections .	4411.5344625670905
But not long was the interval of tranquillity ;	6956.569983702852
Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him ?	7580.954879528459
and the kindness of the late Darcy , though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his own words .	4341.244289083896
Not so hasty , if you please .	8702.625765483368
the latter of whom , however , could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her , in spite of all Miss Bingley's witticisms on fine eyes .	4828.042442165199
They went to the library , therefore , and asked their father , whether he would not wish them to make it known to her .	4914.613096178547
But consider your daughters .	9555.414949952365
and considering Collins's character , connections , and situation in life , I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair , as most people can boast on entering the marriage state .	4215.74973900435
Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts ?	8563.342240538093
said her aunt .	12923.165608335778
said she , I heard you before ;	8110.708621120361
You begin to comprehend me , do you ?	7202.809489632204
As to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , I am not able to judge ;	4871.530691615095
and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way .	5263.797649918606
and her mother , with manners so far from right herself , was entirely insensible of the evil .	4662.080100886602
EDW .	29757.454875608575
and they pursued the accustomed circuit ;	6699.257089858687
that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side , and that if it were , it must belong to Darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance .	4596.106102710166
No really , replied Elizabeth ;	9909.768108592642
but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely , more I think than last year .	5653.428512709184
when I went away , I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again !	5470.18680845939
but , though she could not look , she could listen , and he told her of feelings , which , in proving of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable .	4044.97737939414
and , after standing a few moments without saying a word , he suddenly recollected himself , and took leave .	4348.138612166362
The picture gallery , and two or three of the principal bed-rooms , were all that remained to be shewn .	5089.5435577742355
I will read you the passage which particularly hurts me .	5420.5406864243
I am sorry for her , because , with her disposition , she may not get over it immediately .	4082.8514053279314
which , as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence , she accordingly read ;	5918.470205936217
that speech savours strongly of disappointment .	9969.069424527217
but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear .	6747.97917706862
Perhaps I do .	13322.029220187442
but if he wished to converse with her , he might have better success .	5532.923325443338
It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man .	6193.082578062473
because we shall see the less of him .	9887.980455828847
No indeed ;	15432.223809528767
Royalty payments must be paid within <TIME_PERIOD > following each date on which you prepare ( or are legally required to prepare ) your periodic tax returns .	5354.9911853494095
Poor little Lizzy !	15631.185103745442
Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county , she was a most active magistrate in her own parish , the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by Collins ;	4258.86973532171
I hope , said she , as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day , you will give your mother-in-law a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her tongue ;	3911.114173058453
We had better not mention it .	8662.74803534955
Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as Bingley had now been gone a week , and nothing was heard of his return .	4196.419555559011
he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune , or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn .	4766.973785146406
She felt anew the justice of Darcy's objections ;	6567.607387801522
and all for the sake of Collins too !	6212.069976942277
but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting .	5482.713952683842
but , however , he did not admire her at all : indeed , nobody can , you know ;	4430.291212785176
Much as I respect them , I believe , I thought only of you .	6767.5540881188435
with barefaced questions , ingenious suppositions , and distant surmises ;	8523.837776034541
Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting , that had she chosen it , she might by this time have been presented to her , as her future niece ;	4237.370248191401
Miss Darcy , the daughter of Darcy , of Pemberley , and Lady Anne , could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner .	4892.565759370452
She had turned away , but on hearing herself called , though in a voice which proved it to be Darcy , she moved again towards the gate .	4324.1408744937435
She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known ;	5779.666277462695
If I have , I shall be the last person to confess it .	5567.749902480768
She was on the point of continuing her walk , when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park ;	4184.830392787008
To the girls , who could not listen to their cousin , and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument , and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle-piece , the interval of waiting appeared very long .	4351.746738979527
In talking over their route the evening before , Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again .	5581.899658307815
To yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you .	6003.516322388222
It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire , nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay ;	4092.152008453167
and she would , at times , have given any thing to be privileged to tell him , that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family .	3964.2307300661014
Not one .	15428.366792564559
said Jane as she finished it .	9310.398764331443
With assumed tranquillity he then replied , I have no wish of denying that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that I rejoice in my success .	4660.742800209429
Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring ?	7156.306202793877
But pride where there is a real superiority of mind , pride will be always under good regulation .	5302.341713753643
thoughtless , thoughtless Lydia !	15633.167043926136
I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness ;	3810.1117242517844
With a triumphant smile , they were told , that it was ten miles round .	5878.326191778455
but the gentlemen will have Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton ;	5703.15380278553
You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion , which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty .	4388.481689581113
The necessity must be obeyed and farther apology would be absurd .	6372.72806691619
One of them does .	12966.542491476523
the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy .	8053.675219095342
Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity , and by the middle of June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears ;	4497.075503148328
Now is your time .	13451.457857713594
it was impossible to think of any thing else , and totally indisposed for employment , she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise .	4518.861483550107
They were not the only objects of Collins's admiration .	6033.305594724204
but her own opinion continued the same , and she left him disappointed and sorry .	5412.205258288978
but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal .	4692.5901892771235
With a strong prejudice against every thing he might say , she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield .	5232.261117284462
Bingley met them with hopes that Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected .	6043.602388887054
To congratulate myself on the hope of relations , whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ?	5592.224064233486
I write rather slowly .	8586.299434892233
The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge , and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed .	4473.344251708977
This information , however , startled Bennet ;	8320.006285815281
Care of him !	18472.368653312184
It was drawn at the same time as the other about eight years ago .	4883.603544556297
There is , I believe , in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil , a natural defect , which not even the best education can overcome .	4509.838857430682
If !	17417.55255071551
They have a sharp , shrewish look , which I do not like at all ;	5712.635379649111
as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general , was beyond the Collinses' reach .	6609.641255801309
My brother admires her greatly already , he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing , her relations all wish the connection as much as his own , and a sister's partiality is not misleading me , I think , when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman's heart .	4104.582402289451
But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend ;	4471.900720280146
Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile , she said , I did not know before that you ever walked this way .	5537.558322946792
My manners must have been in fault , but not intentionally I assure you .	5764.296990558412
I want to be told whether I ought , or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand Wickham's character .	4690.256261444394
and fearful of its being Darcy , she was directly retreating .	5894.739877645041
Oh !	6826.5207498362
What a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt !	6093.314478581236
No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard .	7329.889985045767
Her mother's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determined not to venture near her , lest she might hear too much .	4916.930545944854
I certainly have not the talent which some people possess , said Darcy , of conversing easily with those I have never seen before .	4562.45124663695
A most welcome negative followed the last question and her alarms being now removed , she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself ;	4738.249424559713
I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship .	4108.110378445242
though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon regained her composure , and calmly replied , Why should you be surprised , my dear Eliza ?	4894.828231269058
While she spoke , an involuntary glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes .	4560.355359488192
Do clear them too , or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody .	6239.244399572497
I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children .	4958.467310961343
After making every possible enquiry on that side London , Colonel F came on into Hertfordshire , anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes , and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield , but without any success , no such people had been seen to pass through .	4368.172441618332
She was no sooner in possession of it , than hurrying into the little copse , where she was least likely to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the benches , and prepared to be happy ;	4029.8585104565504
not equal to Lydia's for him .	11766.965116428715
She finds Miss Pope a treasure .	8103.270527315195
but the things should be ordered immediately .	6638.478073246397
I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn ;	5142.719377504491
The rest of the evening brought her little amusement .	5966.8646633047
and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy .	4230.428405593986
I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject , but I will not leave the country without confiding them , and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable .	3596.64621016287
Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings , Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy , calling for every one's congratulations , and laughing and talking with more violence than ever ;	5224.664951844165
She was perfectly sensible that he never had ;	5734.793573623978
till , shaking off his embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the gentlest of accents , You , who so well know my feelings towards Darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right .	4349.941414283122
But the morrow passed off much better than she expected ;	5850.902628924307
He spoke well , but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed , and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride .	4479.5844748152085
and , according to the present plan , were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire .	4672.264296137346
I believed you to be wishing , expecting my addresses .	6120.560123361791
His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen , on his returning to Netherfield .	5113.385981071907
but it must be done .	7315.424445240786
I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object .	4715.133676713918
But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man , whom they had never seen before , of most gentleman-like appearance , walking with an officer on the other side of the way .	4116.924846453716
He is the best landlord , and the best master , said she , that ever lived .	4870.479781569061
Though it is difficult , said Jane , to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due , the wish is certainly to his credit .	4877.506632627538
I am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose Darcy's regard .	4172.476399106366
Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door , and the carriage stopped at the small gate , which led by a short gravel walk to the house , amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party .	4401.332837689742
We neither of us perform to strangers .	8595.75500665251
He observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ;	4289.741296513424
The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Bennet the next morning , but the post came in without bringing a single line from him .	4502.631374161515
Nothing that she could say , however , had any influence .	7482.412532693158
It is amazing to me , said Bingley , how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished , as they all are .	4346.674668956026
cried he .	14599.376887666256
If he means to be but little at Netherfield , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we might possibly get a settled family there .	4347.203834574603
Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself , but his manners were always so pleasing , that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought , his smiles and his easy address , while he claimed their relationship , would have delighted them all .	4328.599796840387
But my dear Lydia , I don't at all like your going such a way off .	5284.487970233259
E4 .	29757.454875608575
Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves .	5126.28873651777
and a fortnight only was wanting of it , when a letter arrived from Gardiner , which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent .	4605.346830121637
and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening , and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours , Miss Elizabeth , for the two first dances especially , a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her .	3556.544397583989
And there was my aunt , all the time I was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon .	4739.883681003678
It will save me a world of trouble and economy .	6103.361020265262
And what do you think she said besides ?	6667.064973026437
Jane went to him instantly , kissed him , and thanked him for his goodness .	6196.384742369061
and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter , she found little , except the professed affection of the writer , that could give her any comfort .	4182.669404347036
She is on her road somewhere , I dare say , and so passing through Meryton , thought she might as well call on you .	4269.5882918757125
After a slight preparation for good news , the letter was read aloud .	6211.217593133309
Oh , yes .	8523.72536760576
From the very beginning , from the first moment I may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form that ground-work of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike ;	4117.26435416397
My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers .	6562.815288884635
Jane will be quite an old maid soon , I declare .	7096.585330338818
Nothing , on the contrary , could be more natural ;	7328.5819415538335
Yes ;	11624.632075734577
Elizabeth was shocked to think that , however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself , the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal !	4226.940118897177
It had come with a fare from London ;	6676.29996878924
Then , the two third he danced with Miss King , and the two fourth with Maria Lucas , and the two fifth with Jane again , and the two sixth with Lizzy , and the Boulanger If he had had any compassion for me , cried her husband impatiently , he would not have danced half so much !	4159.980192554837
When breakfast was over , they were joined by the sisters ;	6941.671601725073
She did indeed , Louisa .	8051.095438651634
Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London ;	5663.3485868377265
No said Darcy , I have made no such pretension .	7329.955773827381
CHAPTER IV .	11746.06741553873
For , though your accusations were ill-founded , formed on mistaken premises , my behaviour to you at the time , had merited the severest reproof .	5189.088818504356
lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table , after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter ;	6348.609681848598
It was Collins's picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened ;	5314.238650825088
But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities , replied her uncle .	5390.478081570331
Do you not consider that a connection with you , must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody ?	5212.916315388693
My dear Bennet , cried his wife , what are you talking of ?	4852.988131906553
Lydia was a stout , well-grown girl of fifteen , with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance ;	5906.934590434127
It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire .	4785.421067394632
To be sure London was rather thin , but however the little Theatre was open .	5560.824964351815
She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded ;	4546.9287432324145
My mother was in hysterics , and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power , I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done !	4462.343931435215
Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room , and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from Bingley by a housemaid , and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters .	4086.9099518061043
His revenge would have been complete indeed .	8453.130565045667
I could hardly keep my countenance .	7079.279967802554
Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes .	5412.370989381043
She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent , without remembering that his cousin was to go with him ;	4595.695325855097
Elizabeth's misery increased , at such unnecessary , such officious attention !	7662.567332593617
He resigned all claim to assistance in the church , were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it , and accepted in return three thousand pounds .	4580.273386567202
As for myself , it is many , many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner .	4993.994517643121
That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary ;	5580.97288581616
when she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage , the difference , the change was so great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible .	4228.154515554858
That is all settled ;	7725.321051252299
till the latter walked away from her , and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano-forte , stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's countenance .	5001.609768632063
You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters ;	5314.227065207313
And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself ?	6605.066937639409
I do not blame Jane , she continued , for Jane would have got Bingley , if she could .	4071.286969251609
To donate , please visit : <URL> Section 5 .	7670.023130867775
I am astonished , my dear , said Bennet , that you should be so ready to think your own children silly .	3629.1239568168885
The effect was immediate .	9730.085984318766
Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth ;	6052.048077402794
Not that I think Charlotte so very plain but then she is our particular friend .	5636.875963315556
Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine , and his kind intention of christening , marrying , and burying his parishioners whenever it were required .	4345.805857938757
You are quite right .	7428.795662839331
but now , as Bingley's friend and your husband , there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me .	4801.11941391545
Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ;	5493.448977334787
I wish you had been there , my dear , to have given him one of your set downs .	4308.9236477078975
but you must own she is very plain .	6238.949344882878
but attended with all that embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior , the belief of her being proud and reserved .	4411.547387629954
In revolving lady Catherine's expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference .	4733.3199412040585
With a book he was regardless of time ;	7637.76255068601
Their sister's wedding day arrived ;	10732.537798782389
Wickham began to speak on more general topics , Meryton , the neighbourhood , the society , appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen , and speaking of the latter especially , with gentle but very intelligible gallantry .	4519.647929102468
Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters .	5947.590670462034
This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be ;	5321.543195848631
and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better .	5508.65647455675
though I doubt whether his reserve , or anybody's reserve , can be answerable for the event .	5719.749227176906
In a few days more , we may gain some news of them , and till we know that they are not married , and have no design of marrying , do not let us give the matter over as lost .	4130.708585439578
and I wish with all my heart it may prove so ;	4720.779359041944
The younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done ;	5251.779830669973
And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Forster , the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me .	4830.785097113693
She answered him with cold civility .	7258.471666981459
If , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise , should come to his friend within a few days , she added , I shall know how to understand it .	4468.176021744058
But I will not repine .	5890.672640112304
Bingley will not be detained in London by them .	7817.651573646037
We were always encouraged to read , and had all the masters that were necessary .	5720.454812468657
so far we are equal .	11589.491280092036
I was angry perhaps at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper direction .	4718.6103871681335
yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet .	6706.346785903733
She burst into tears as she alluded to it , and for a few minutes could not speak another word .	5141.815094507024

and the evening , though as it passed it seemed long , was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion ;	4310.4275299800975
for Bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken , and Lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , boisterously exclaimed , Good Lord !	4650.043469656818
Is not it so , Bennet ?	9662.139338339086
and I never saw such happy manners !	5692.754245019564
You will only think I feel more than I ought to do , when I tell you all .	4906.443444318571
We may as well wait , perhaps , till the circumstance occurs , before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon .	5019.802359577957
Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion ( unasked too ) on this subject ;	6890.608367827997
Your examination of Darcy is over , I presume , said Miss Bingley ;	6232.680547372495
He spoke of apprehension and anxiety , but his countenance expressed real security .	5687.324904539064
it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome .	7153.777756140029
You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane .	5824.559660306647
As her successor in that house , she regarded her with jealous abhorrence .	6495.009248978902
But what does he say of the living ?	6815.219879236943
E8 or 1 .	14283.895873050673
Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice , which on every other subject shall be my constant guide , though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself .	4441.841253354417
that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place , and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Morris immediately ;	4753.386176747947
1 .	12212.55279990698
They were more disturbed , more unequal , than she had often seen them .	5366.225155532615
and Darcy had much better finish his letter .	6101.051437066321
It is natural that obligation should be felt , and if I could feel gratitude , I would now thank you .	4491.974115565627
They are going to be encamped near Brighton ;	6765.784631058664
If you have not been mistaken here , I must have been in an error .	5234.809743414137

The rain continued the whole evening without intermission ;	7254.174979708635
You have employed your time much better .	6637.482172402638
She saw all the glories of the camp ;	6450.896169693944
My dear , you flatter me .	6394.083401525846

Nobody wants him to come .	13144.561671774996
but she had her share of business as well as her aunt , and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in Lambton , with false excuses for their sudden departure .	4080.4381953767315
The church ought to have been my profession I was brought up for the church , and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living , had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now .	4294.00070605531
Let me take it in the best light , in the light in which it may be understood .	5460.179257285552
Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet , and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body , went away .	4795.134491225817
E8 or 1 .	14283.895873050673
thought she .	21632.83805867054
and as that left too short a period for them to go so far , and see so much as they had proposed , or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on , they were obliged to give up the Lakes , and substitute a more contracted tour ;	3889.404840820908
she cried .	10962.818898217341
Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry , but could only force one most reluctant smile .	5259.89677771632
Yes ;	11624.632075734577
I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind .	4856.768301736919
said she .	12171.146619643097
The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence , or frightened by his high and imposing manners , and sees him only as he chuses to be seen .	4616.017382371719
I advise Darcy , and Lizzy , and Kitty , said Bennet , to walk to Oakham Mount this morning .	5004.3765098070935
and immediately , though not very fluently , gave him to understand , that her sentiments had undergone so material a change , since the period to which he alluded , as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure , his present assurances .	4198.091154188856
To the rest of the family they paid little attention ;	6695.500967852562
That they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice !	5016.910677633054
For my part , I am inclined to believe it all Darcy's , but you shall do as you chuse .	4957.388008517285
She was met in the vestibule by Lydia , who , flying to her , cried in a half whisper , I am glad you are come , for there is such fun here !	3981.3717745567033
But enough of this .	9555.414949952365
Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's interruption , and promised that it should not occur again , if he would resume his book ;	4756.595906061711
She was still very poorly , and Elizabeth would not quit her at all , till late in the evening , when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep , and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself .	3932.879577213386
This he considered sufficient encouragement , and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her , immediately followed .	5217.287699544287
She was a little revived , however , by his bringing back his coffee cup himself ;	4695.703036900778
Except , thought Elizabeth , when she goes to Ramsgate .	8678.56149718365
Can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand ?	6745.750666730787
Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday ;	6253.234402951667
But now she would no longer conceal from her , his share in Lydia's marriage .	5271.28126358063
yes it would be much better to wait till Jane was well , and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again .	5311.348805327734
It was too early in the morning for visitors , and besides , the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours .	4330.801044892544
and however bare of news the country in general might be , they always contrived to learn some from their aunt .	4923.582052557696
and their mother talked on , of her dislike of Darcy , and her resolution to be civil to him only as Bingley's friend , without being heard by either of them .	4223.731589352954
for on entering that place they removed into a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom .	5367.870603622505
The loo table , however , did not appear .	6907.762696125198
which brought them again , after some time , in a descent among hanging woods , to the edge of the water , in one of its narrowest parts .	5242.501299183191
and the other , how I am ever to pay him .	4900.0066668257305
but when the servants were withdrawn , he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest , and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine , by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness .	4136.324345242304
You know , sister , we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it .	5212.702884716807
He readily agreed to it .	8655.16129069169
I am afraid you will not be able to make it out , but I hardly know what I have written .	3915.686579285566
She will be married at sixteen !	6403.938831551866
and she was , in fact , almost engrossed by her nephews , speaking to them , especially to Darcy , much more than to any other person in the room .	3833.8291649413154
But you will know it , when I have told you what happened the very next day .	5035.503822727087
Lady Catherine , Sir William , and and Collins sat down to quadrille ;	5550.6663886770875
Another day I will do the same ;	10480.309882130758
Be assured , my dear Sir , that Collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you , and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the bitterest kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove .	4600.077252279132
It is from my cousin , Collins , who , when I am dead , may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases .	4162.060918853333
Oh !	6826.5207498362
I am by no means of opinion , I assure you , said he , that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ;	3622.878324922863
Adieu to disappointment and spleen .	13637.93872720995
Let her go then .	11869.802539403272
He concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which , in spite of all his endeavours , he had found impossible to conquer ;	4761.4379161255365
The sanguine hope of good , however , which the benevolence of her heart suggested , had not yet deserted her ;	5094.289568662983
but unable to waste such a precious occasion , she suddenly got up , and saying to Kitty , Come here , my love , I want to speak to you , took her out of the room .	4025.9037055415874
Now and then , they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship , and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits .	5181.074419708134
I am perfectly ready , I assure you , to keep my engagement ;	4229.2742031063135
and Bingley's large fortune , the mention of which gave animation to their mother , was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign .	4584.528502345117
If , as I conclude will be the case , you send me full powers to act in your name , throughout the whole of this business , I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement .	4381.581021243188
If you mention my name at the Bell , you will be attended to .	5342.622746522783
and Collins having been in waiting near the lodges , to make them his parting obeisance , was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence , of their appearing in very good health , and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected , after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings .	3995.3264058365635
Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all , and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet , with great pleasure .	5016.6541895961545
and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing her into Derbyshire , had been the means of uniting them .	4334.290927522003
I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies ( if such young ladies there are ) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time .	3705.587858116984
Vanity and pride are different things , though the words are often used synonimously .	7377.456950970888
CHAPTER VI .	11746.06741553873
and I think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all , and very hypocritical .	4495.888566135724
I only hope they may have half my good luck .	6011.549047326146
For though elated by his rank , it did not render him supercilious ;	6818.284643184472
You and the girls may go , or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better , for as you are as handsome as any of them , Bingley might like you the best of the party .	4242.185620427986
Her prudent mother , occupied by the same ideas , forbore to invite him to sit by herself .	5596.572684229363
He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship , replied Elizabeth with emphasis , and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life .	4322.223245706317
stay where you are .	14415.881048019626
Pray , my dear aunt , what is the difference in matrimonial affairs , between the mercenary and the prudent motive ?	5428.903237000761
and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long , that even Bingley's good humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone .	4164.274891647739
But now it comes out .	7407.7462941657
she comes here to-morrow with him .	9548.108779207316
Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us .	7855.38266215457
cried Elizabeth when she had finished it .	7864.683484643454
In understanding Darcy was the superior .	8949.262709086936
Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend , that had attended her from that part of the world .	5102.6152941092
the ladies drove on , and the others returned into the house .	6847.20885588674
My dear aunt , this is being serious indeed .	5831.17154837242
but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him .	5949.419460425041
Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding ;	7709.944653371845
Elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to confirm his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself ;	4178.146748654512
When Denny , and Wickham , and Pratt , and two or three more of the men came in , they did not know him in the least .	4800.234179150208

her features , though not plain , were insignificant ;	8717.053116004132
their father was in neither ;	12805.416551947083
But against this , there were objections ;	7569.394349723822
Darcy was almost as far from her , as the table could divide them .	5843.731011029536
But she is very young ;	7139.850815135453
but was too angry with Lydia , to send any message to her .	5949.419460425041
but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody ;	4801.144931554321
Bingley was by no means deficient , but Darcy was clever .	6314.266124263361
The introduction , however , was immediately made ;	7047.383370499606
You must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention ;	5281.40515736826
Nothing could console and nothing appease her .	8976.851332258728
Bingley .	19704.859897840557
At present I will say nothing about it .	6811.457124746392
but what could set you off in the first place ?	6578.204573564382
but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane ;	4689.064530472127
The loss of her daughter made Bennet very dull for several days .	6162.242380864301
and , while examining the nearer aspect of the house , all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned .	4437.796624683554
several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle , a private had been flogged , and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married .	5224.705508377263
and to her it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first , and was in a way to be very much in love ;	4179.313935773968
There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name .	5103.89135337136
In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ;	4728.876081966163
she cried : This is delightful indeed !	8119.5318380630415
In town I believe he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence , and being now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and dissipation .	4589.575348354382
said she , as she looked in her face .	7245.594303011204
This fine account of him , whispered her aunt , as they walked , is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend .	5082.913374501292
Young women should always be properly guarded and attended , according to their situation in life .	6676.979685876215
not deficient in good humour when they were pleased , nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it ;	5981.868017424333
Complied with !	22757.11010138367
Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey , and as she did not answer them all herself , attention was necessary , which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her ;	4376.377362266061
but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters .	6578.204573564382
are quite well .	17658.907085145383
Oh !	6826.5207498362
I grieve to find , however , that Colonel F is not disposed to depend upon their marriage ;	5157.853056549026
and if I had my will , we should .	5194.626174608339
Why will you think so ?	11116.320151180227
and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on the renewal of his addresses .	3846.3998486406053
I might as well enquire , replied she , why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ?	4185.773846710369
I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here .	4180.433920376542
who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister , and gratified my vanity , in useless or blameable distrust .	5768.556247116267
Jane heard them with horror .	10465.241711191953
My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family , and if my manner has been at all reprehensible , I here beg leave to apologise .	4423.646121219335
She enquired into Charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly and minutely , and gave her a great deal of advice , as to the management of them all ;	4543.238643023195
I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party .	4538.961149407082
Attention , forbearance , patience with Darcy , was injury to Wickham .	8019.4483268181275
and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must produce , found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business .	4479.542260515533
so genteel and so easy !	11589.491280092036
Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to the piano-forte , and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way , which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived , she seated herself .	4422.429688398464
Oh !	6826.5207498362
Though Lydia's short letter to F gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green , something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W never intended to go there , or to marry Lydia at all , which was repeated to Colonel F who instantly taking the alarm , set off from B intending to trace their route .	4199.114751311782
She stared , coloured , doubted , and was silent .	6396.449060422208
and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person ( Lady Lucas ) freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Bingley .	4266.8957432297
I , who have valued myself on my abilities !	6020.819868512369
I wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind .	5009.567435599406
He was seriously concerned , that a cause of so little advantage to any one , should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law , and he was determined , if possible , to find out the extent of his assistance , and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could .	3912.046005034845
She will make him a very proper wife .	6450.896169693944
But depend upon it , Collins , she added , that Lizzy shall be brought to reason .	5213.850465978675
He comes down on Thursday at the latest , very likely on Wednesday .	6025.732348775594
Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is .	6153.852207953772
What do you think has happened this morning ?	6405.2884869434065
She was gone directly .	7001.838821611713
Elizabeth was forced to go .	6548.860025840417
and when your sister is recovered , you shall if you please name the very day of the ball .	4608.208345011984
and Darcy , after looking at her for a moment , turned silently away .	5369.357560998449
He was full of joy and attention .	6288.444296192864
He looked serious as usual ;	8655.16129069169
nay , which has already arisen from it , I am sure you would judge differently in the affair .	6247.406339517874
Lydia laughed , and said , Aye , that is just like your formality and discretion .	6308.007222565041
Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister ;	6609.641255801309
In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man !	6093.868863020982
When all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at Pemberley ;	5382.016525807573
Yes ;	11624.632075734577
As soon as Jane had read Gardiner's hope of Lydia's being soon married , her joy burst forth , and every following sentence added to its exuberance .	4620.982504939139
Jane's temper was not desponding , and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart .	4812.630926898795
We may as well leave them by themselves you know ;	6605.060234881972
Elizabeth replied that it was .	8469.003929315006
The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning ;	6706.96056548586
any thing was a welcome relief to him at Rosings ;	8901.060544562486
Much more rational , my dear Caroline , I dare say , but it would not be near so much like a ball .	5347.92157392907
What do you mean ?	7410.874314601639
However , I did not hear above one word in ten , for I was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear Wickham .	5201.635615180581
A carat character is used to denote superscription .	8091.7293118139205
He has not an ill-natured look .	7057.041271861085
What could your ladyship propose by it ?	7796.056341030438
In Three Volumes .	9009.720995690765
with tears and lamentations of regret , invectives against the villanous conduct of Wickham , and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage ;	5612.640654141501
They insist also on my seeing Jones therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me and excepting a sore-throat and head-ache there is not much the matter with me .	4447.137582010929
But such as they were , it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them , and what a contrariety of emotion they excited .	4773.010441656134
Jane had not been gone long before it rained hard .	7006.805466914151
but I am sure I never saw any thing of it .	4769.582483321952
Reynolds's respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master .	7118.298473943141
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ?	8914.628507904577
They saw much to interest , but nothing to justify enquiry .	6528.046460245368
cried Miss Bingley .	12596.13613386615
but she did weep from vexation and envy .	6052.209361553459
Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight .	8037.238223422664

Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister .	7170.921742461265
and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle , so I was determined he should know it , and so I let down the side glass next to him , and took off my glove , and let my hand just rest upon the window frame , so that he might see the ring , and then I bowed and smiled like any thing .	3979.473931684536
I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression .	4142.342538651597
Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish , self reproach , she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness .	6072.280087146251
but as he took up his abode with the Lucases , his arrival was no great inconvenience to Bennet .	4869.882987285056
Lady Catherine then observed , Your father's estate is entailed on Collins , I think .	5382.641284191048
Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort ;	5428.039310773943
Collins has made an offer to Lizzy , and she will not have him .	6249.7822284122385
I think there cannot be too little said on the subject .	5095.99713836013
and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Darcy's looks and behaviour .	4321.76557208325
and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her .	4229.898431827743
I thank you for explaining it so fully .	5820.668409337991
She cared for none of her friends , she wanted no help of his , she would not hear of leaving Wickham .	5000.524600607155
Thank Heaven !	16715.868391186457
YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION , THE TRADEMARK OWNER , AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL , DIRECT , INDIRECT , CONSEQUENTIAL , PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE .	4539.93314483182
but he will vouch for the good conduct , the probity and honour of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that Wickham has deserved much less attention from Darcy than he has received ;	4242.281572042235

That is not very likely ;	7809.220763077707
At present I will not say more , but perhaps when we are better acquainted He was interrupted by a summons to dinner ;	4881.413717002979
But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill .	5249.020140939886
one , that Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief ;	7621.616776307488
Elizabeth , after slightly surveying it , went to a window to enjoy its prospect .	5166.4283911303155
What can be the meaning of this !	7099.911247441211
What is Darcy to me , pray , that I should be afraid of him ?	5625.094533847002
I assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town .	4442.694110160948
Obstinate , headstrong girl !	15633.167043926136
for certainly , there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction .	6382.959894616078
It now first struck her , that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage , and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings , in the absence of more eligible visitors .	4212.828366320399
Certainly not ;	18498.8172501179
You could not make me happy , and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who would make you so .	4650.65068379542
Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice .	8362.806228377349
The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information , was as sincere as her brother's in sending it .	5169.393395104246
I thank you for my share of the favour , said Elizabeth ;	4934.850933275975
I have nothing either to hope or fear , and nothing to reproach him with .	4592.2491322081505
At present I am not in love with Wickham ;	6875.099232516411
It is only that he has better means of having it than many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor .	4140.871942651275
and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked Darcy before they had known any thing of the matter .	4399.155907435708
but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them .	4818.636277578594
I have by no means done .	5846.403639248736
That is not an unnatural surmise , said Fitzwilliam , but it is lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly .	4781.983195680042
all that his library afforded .	13144.561671774996
The commendation bestowed on him by Reynolds was of no trifling nature .	6162.242380864301
You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them .	5284.696851411131
But let me advise you to think better of it .	6543.624494085479
You excel so much in the dance , Miss Eliza , that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you ;	5015.077070670433
MY DEAR BROTHER , At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece , and such as , upon the whole , I hope will give you satisfaction .	5169.189616784046
Thank you , said Lydia , for if you did , I should certainly tell you all , and then Wickham would be angry .	5239.704177086638
In Three Volumes .	9009.720995690765
I know no harm of her .	6308.052066219114
Then , who taught you ?	10342.653671362756
I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary .	4642.208628344531
and though he belonged to one of the universities , he had merely kept the necessary terms , without forming at it any useful acquaintance .	4283.961745153884
He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily postponed seeing him , till after the departure of the former .	4222.2787149302585
Such a charming man !	11532.53449191105
His pride , said Miss Lucas , does not offend me so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it .	4874.638291481782
thought Elizabeth .	21632.83805867054
In a few minutes , Bennet half opened the door and called out , Lizzy , my dear , I want to speak with you .	4298.532050593713
But Lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me .	5923.071915848513
You may depend upon my seeking no further .	6006.376883389781
but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Philips , and was , by her watchfulness , most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin .	4457.115265620654
As yet , she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its reasonableness .	5491.215412076403
I should as soon call her mother a wit .	5661.903400274211
We will be down as soon as we can , said Jane ;	6291.561904216949
This must be the grossest falsehood !	8649.367524689644
Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before , how many years longer Bennet was likely to live ;	4952.049739618998
Collins then returned to Elizabeth .	10465.241711191953
Yes ;	11624.632075734577
Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene , and could observe the three ladies before her composedly .	5258.291293556826
and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Collins , was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house , as soon as Bennet were dead .	4079.716770677855
And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother ?	6868.944383977311
Miss Eliza Bennet , said Miss Bingley , despises cards .	6488.554253187139
that as to fortune , it is a most eligible match ;	7316.157887265815
and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister's , Wickham is by no means a respectable young man .	3997.5075381198226
Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour , till Sir William thus began .	4334.139290462303
What could be more natural than his asking you again ?	6534.791033528359
Certain it is , that the living became vacant two years ago , exactly as I was of an age to hold it , and that it was given to another man ;	5169.2286839352955
I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh , and of her mother Lady Catherine .	4407.439743888308
Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition .	7027.2577389790495
I shall send this by express , that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer .	4589.62059342035
He is certainly a good brother , said Elizabeth , as she walked towards one of the windows .	4884.419301317335
If you'll believe me , I did not once put my foot out of doors , though I was there a fortnight .	5206.968414277206
And it is the more to be lamented , because there is reason to suppose , as my dear Charlotte informs me , that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter , has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence , though , at the same time , for the consolation of yourself and Bennet , I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an enormity , at so early an age .	3792.9327782349956
and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn , and of her stay in Derbyshire , so often , and in so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts .	4063.362942017019
but at the same time , there was no one , whose knowledge of a sister's frailty would have mortified her so much .	4679.146730002177
My father and mother believe the worst , but I cannot think so ill of him .	5048.5437829316725
Wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we have thought him ;	6539.5870360461095
Ten thousand pounds !	15836.337524380288
I do assure you , Sir , that I have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man .	4000.8562091109825
But as to your other objection , I am afraid it will hardly hold good .	5390.625516224079
Yet now I must believe you , cried Jane .	8572.385705047465
and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself .	4540.360829987034
She has no money , no connections , nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for ever .	4783.279314632175
In seeing Bingley , her thoughts naturally flew to her sister ;	6779.42541697891
Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match ;	7803.459243300347
A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood , since you went away .	5763.427022079794
I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude ;	5295.972598497066
and though Philips , as well as her sister , stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good humour encouraged , yet , whenever she did speak , she must be vulgar .	4016.431239115721
Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family , they did not attempt to oppose it , for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants , while they waited at table , and judged it better that one only of the household , and the one whom they could most trust , should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject .	3967.2074775027086
It was only said , 'Lately , George Wickham , Esq .	5183.6618404326655
It will be her turn soon to be teazed , said Miss Lucas .	5385.674052370946
Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one ;	9686.967842588996
We accordingly went and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend , the certain evils of such a choice .	5085.93220373751
Indeed he has no improper pride .	10236.43505402937
and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane , and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do .	4141.09000892289
There is something a little stately in him to be sure , replied her aunt , but it is confined to his air , and is not unbecoming .	4563.981202602807
By Elizabeth's instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband , which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself .	4811.524033681571
From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent .	9336.714746223868
I shall not say that you are mistaken , he replied , because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ;	4215.633519580087
Blame you !	22757.11010138367
She will be married !	7234.080381589524
Is he married or single ?	11290.910053501206
but she sat down , resolving within herself , to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man .	4590.3140446129855
And with regard to the resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the former were excited by his marrying me , it would not give me one moment's concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn .	4160.033711538364
She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject , and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect .	4601.191941020417
The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister , will prove what she felt .	5230.569491718039
I am the less surprised at what has happened , replied Sir William , from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire .	3918.1806911973035
If you are redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase Project Gutenberg associated with or appearing on the work , you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1 .	4304.684829403763
I did not think Caroline in spirits , were her words , but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London .	3961.516366894995
That reply will do for the present .	8138.001754524051
But , unluckily for her ladyship , its effect had been exactly contrariwise .	5186.689836336721
Their parties abroad were less varied than before ;	8431.996563430595
The indirect boast ;	10907.146678305417
Till I was in Kent , and saw so much both of Darcy and his relation , Colonel Fitzwilliam , I was ignorant of the truth myself .	5174.081470843691
cried Elizabeth .	9945.194991360355
YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE , STRICT LIABILITY , BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1 .	5359.2173243664265
But she had no reason to fear and Gardiner's curiosity ;	5561.800080505136
Collins , however , was not discouraged from speaking again , and Darcy's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech , and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way .	4333.159167232923
but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley's inattention .	5360.2822861657405
Presuming , however , that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment , than any dislike of the proposal , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of society , a perfect willingness to accept it , she ventured to engage for her attendance , and the day after the next was fixed on .	4362.401816393409
Indeed , Eliza , you will be as welcome to me as either of them .	5778.698437126978
for on the very morning after their own arrival at Lambton , these visitors came .	5829.326092847015
This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ;	5147.435561722272
safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune .	10178.436969860899
What is your own opinion ?	9026.742890631776
and Bennet , who could by no means wish for so speedy a return , immediately said , But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here , my good sir ?	4301.433681446441
He meant to provide for me amply , and thought he had done it ;	5629.863880466335
To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew ;	5703.747886612156
If I were not afraid of judging harshly , I should be almost tempted to say , that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this .	4526.073776222991
And , my dear Jane , I never saw you look in greater beauty .	5616.614628713316
His misfortunes !	14716.331527303235
The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt .	5644.0270078474
and had this led to no suspicion , the faces of both as they hastily turned round , and moved away from each other , would have told it all .	4379.348528389564
6 .	29757.454875608575
How much I shall have to tell !	7584.985538449648
and whatever he did , done gracefully .	6931.597499650502
It was a large , well-proportioned room , handsomely fitted up .	4471.0511000783
She sat intently at work , striving to be composed , and without daring to lift up her eyes , till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister , as the servant was approaching the door .	4322.151233015721
They entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds ;	5250.288499698281
but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome .	5628.9252759868605
A place too , with which so many of your acquaintance are connected .	6481.166854237239
and in spite of every thing , was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune .	4169.083269721257
Take care , Lizzy ;	15012.190929676433
And this , said she , is the end of all his friend's anxious circumspection !	5443.651050754447
for that will have more weight in the argument , Miss Bennet , than you may be aware of .	5519.067105292068
assuring him that Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ;	5843.737962653644
when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet , she turned suddenly towards him and said , By the bye , Charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield ?	4841.098689030249
She looked at Jane , to see how she bore it ;	5352.987476526539
I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which I am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before .	3862.7698552098927
If one could but go to Brighton !	7153.2146665445125
and Elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject .	4684.9384461196205
She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley .	6843.551665902812
the gentlemen being out , they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere .	6750.168180758183
Gardiner , to whom the chief of this news had been given before , in the course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with her , made her sister a slight answer , and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation .	4426.5761464322895
Let me write for you , said Jane , if you dislike the trouble yourself .	5822.933350661362
The happiness which this reply produced , was such as he had probably never felt before ;	5453.237485732502
And , above all things , keep Bennet from fighting .	6492.198590194316
Oh !	6826.5207498362
I never heard any harm of her ;	5423.2277995732675
By supposing such an affection , you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong , and me most unhappy .	5842.381611428867
I can recal nothing worse .	6974.038299794295
Their lodgings were not long a secret , and at length they began to know the officers themselves .	5832.66825222841
I like her appearance , said Elizabeth , struck with other ideas .	5880.5071126283165
We had better go into the avenue .	8076.118095322209
I am prodigiously proud of him .	5316.807288691119
and it was not wholly without foundation .	5289.011289935148
Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune , which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day .	4542.164684552188
Those who chose to be idle , certainly might .	8677.050963935873
You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble ;	5171.103620057451
To Jane herself , she exclaimed , there could be no possibility of objection .	6169.369454962629
It was all conjecture .	6577.228910388059
Elizabeth merely curtseyed to him , without saying a word .	6748.418922325659
You taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous .	5909.977567873183
but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected .	5414.421535545803
and nothing therefore remained to be done , but to think well of them both , to defend the conduct of each , and throw into the account of accident or mistake , whatever could not be otherwise explained .	4247.821771468309
What is there of good to be expected ?	7359.820359299675
It is what every body says .	6176.82657758323
Every body is disgusted with his pride .	8815.48233735115
said her sister .	12923.165608335778
and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield , I should probably be off in five minutes .	4911.632535067757
adding , that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it .	5814.95477881473
When I am in company with him , I will not be wishing .	6092.959196129392
His surprise was great .	11030.44237905895
and they have another , who lives somewhere near Cheapside .	5688.026136152586
At length , however , his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family .	4347.470783520793
Of a fine , stout , healthy love it may .	7882.606845492171
She remembered also , that till the Netherfield family had quitted the country , he had told his story to no one but herself ;	4769.7300397575955
I am not ashamed of having been mistaken or , at least , it is slight , it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters .	3752.0545449319466
She shall hear my opinion .	8750.12651669961
It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ;	4820.802017753475
I am far from attributing any part of Bingley's conduct to design , said Elizabeth ;	4328.006956204716
The second began .	10907.146678305417
This is a wretched beginning indeed !	7608.35743146718
a favourite with her mother , whose affection had brought her into public at an early age .	6265.96244464594
I am so happy .	5786.741201416933
He stood by her , however , for some minutes , in silence ;	6025.86897499426
She will be taken good care of .	6304.168307507283
I should like to know how he behaves among strangers .	5259.688454927749
Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Wickham .	6212.718662719247
Yes certainly .	15309.047253586548
Your's , c .	10483.694660383553
Poor dear child !	15631.185103745442
Your sister I also watched .	10137.463945982905
The sisters , on hearing this , repeated three or four times how much they were grieved , how shocking it was to have a bad cold , and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves ;	4446.7402378255765
For the last week they had seen very little of either Lady Catherine or her daughter .	6028.219331575803
If that had been nearer , she would not have gone so soon .	6300.533417542952
It is nearly fifty miles .	6507.312774570377
Seriously , however , she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's concurrence .	6146.229681872425
Very , very much .	13070.559258279189
Charlotte did not stay much longer , and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard .	5721.37210881361
for as to Darcy's using him ill , it is perfectly false ;	6454.5294325856585
Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit , but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it .	4679.397582450559
A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant ;	5599.099914836789
and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects .	5855.390845589442
Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think , without feeling that she had been blind , partial , prejudiced , absurd .	5473.792323589963
She was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when .	4604.152211678755
Her affections had been continually fluctuating , but never without an object .	6555.922367737725
You are joking , Lizzy .	7194.458785218755
You dislike an argument , and want to silence this .	6745.851750687476
Darcy , who was leaning against the mantle-piece with his eyes fixed on her face , seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise .	4671.3889005524115
My dear Madam , he replied , this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what I have been hoping to receive ;	4482.9932312741375
Ring the bell , Kitty , for Hill .	10178.436969860899
He was always to have gone on Saturday , and to Saturday he still meant to stay .	4862.964768072344
Believe me , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that your modesty , so far from doing you any disservice , rather adds to your other perfections .	4985.515326626615
The gentlemen arrived early ;	9078.7519639472
How is such a man to be worked on ?	7356.215307803656
Merely to the illustration of your character , said she , endeavouring to shake off her gravity .	6690.2512128601575
and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned , and preparing her to be surprised , she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Darcy and herself .	4071.6639439440605
but I am afraid of alarming you be assured that we are all well .	4805.883480590182
I am , said he , with a firm voice .	4783.545139753376
Let her be called down .	10617.40304560571
It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first .	4536.166833358131
Removed !	29757.454875608575
In the first place , she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter ;	5257.380695989658
My dear , dear Lydia !	5680.817066888236
Impossible .	28083.34266691188
Reynolds could interest her on no other point .	9533.8906793828
Is this , thought Elizabeth , meant for me ?	7878.001781231837
and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves , and meanly of others .	5138.151968425724
and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration of her , of her former favourite George Wickham ;	4085.4740673168344
He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate , generous heart in the world ;	4644.58095030419
and after observing that he was a very gentleman-like man , asked her how she had liked him .	4709.134732053355
To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either .	6574.240363230101
Do you play and sing , Miss Bennet ?	7099.309724633811
No principle of either , would be violated by my marriage with Darcy .	6516.961933058382
You will be censured , slighted , and despised , by every one connected with him .	4969.480314848907
Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural ;	5351.11748658389
Aye , so it is , cried her mother , and Long does not come back till the day before ;	5503.894483994976
With all my heart ;	10929.892868049596
on his side even more .	12548.429564955046
Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality , especially on Lydia's side , but nothing to give him any alarm .	5163.273345680248
His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage , for Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane , in order to have the earliest assurance of it ;	4612.366140980887
But she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow .	5350.227967425678
my last letter had never reached her .	9572.858094465937
I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford .	4520.907238678321
Oh , my dear Lizzy !	8003.692595304744
He was well , but so much engaged with Darcy , that they scarcely ever saw him .	4862.964768072344
but , instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to Miss Bennet , I beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so I took the liberty of coming to ask .	3958.2212172194863
but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic .	5333.740971165122
for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement , they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning , from all those who were not immediately on the spot .	4643.1349408687065
After pausing on this point a considerable while , she once more continued to read .	6239.159073654447
and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her .	5159.138919297791
Her own thoughts were employing her .	8996.374037255282
1 .	12212.55279990698
and his attachment to Wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me , to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow , and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant .	3921.523345763269
Mary would not understand them ;	11589.491280092036
The situation of your mother's family , though objectionable , was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently , so almost uniformly betrayed by herself , by your three younger sisters , and occasionally even by your father .	4169.566108493953
The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Bennet's visit , and determining when they should ask him to dinner .	4425.347917154027
The country is a vast deal pleasanter , is not it , Bingley ?	5853.642601770715
I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man , without having a wish beyond it .	4180.001221249437
and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct , who will believe me ?	4426.333451893453
Smiles decked the face of Bennet , as the carriage drove up to the door ;	6589.460384781516
When convinced on that article , Miss Bennet had nothing farther to wish .	6455.161236806039
and Bennet , in the meanwhile , was giving way to all the happy schemes , which the good humour , and common politeness of Bingley , in half an hour's visit , had revived .	4235.383413750477
But her conclusion was false ;	8185.258925222511
yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Gardiner thought of him , and Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's beginning the subject .	5428.064445121688
No , she would go home .	7756.035283807756
No , never .	10129.561338489226
He is a pleasant fellow , and would jilt you creditably .	5389.898576916287
Jane had been a week in town , without either seeing or hearing from Caroline .	5931.953800749939
for though feeling almost secure , and with reason , for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging , he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday .	4821.36806591182
Well , then supposing them to be in London .	6260.45874545713
Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related .	8717.053116004132
The apothecary came , and having examined his patient , said , as might be supposed , that she had caught a violent cold , and that they must endeavour to get the better of it ;	4404.078491824427
Teazing , teazing , man !	13637.93872720995
and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Wickham's attentions .	5855.62419039049
I was right , therefore ;	6574.466362288215
I pity you , Miss Eliza , for this discovery of your favourite's guilt ;	5467.624574124695
and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see .	4847.692004698102
They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday ;	7293.174137247628
It was exactly a scene , and exactly among people , where he had apparently least to do , and least temptation to go .	4362.449101577612
The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade , and within view of his own warehouses , could have been so well bred and agreeable .	4531.237105620546
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule .	5261.599179229428
My mind however is now made up on the subject , for having received ordination at Easter , I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh , widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh , whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish , where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship , and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church of England .	3787.192017614997
No ;	15660.948551348763
I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude .	4076.896344670041
The general prejudice against Darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton , to attempt to place him in an amiable light .	4399.463554335398
and as for Purvis Lodge , the attics are dreadful .	5178.568276118767
When Bennet was told of this , she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected , considering what her anxiety for his life had been before .	4772.396773620247
He spoke of it as a certain event , of which the time alone could be undecided .	5222.036800064393
Elizabeth soon observed , and instantly understood it .	6947.682770631223
But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness , is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging .	4791.912102810293
You are too hasty , Sir , she cried .	5928.384108819891
What do you keep winking at me for ?	6593.441949988571
On the very last day of the regiment's remaining in Meryton , he dined with others of the officers at Longbourn ;	5063.042801093982
Wickham of course wanted more than he could get ;	8102.512732193453
Elizabeth was glad of it ;	6794.492091233071
she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes ;	7451.210200058808
but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry .	6339.382326180126
However little Darcy might have liked such an address , he contented himself with coolly replying , that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned , no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer .	4674.364420727356
and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too !	5817.110652347848
but the ladies were ready enough to talk , and Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement , nor inclined to be silent himself .	4605.010809257565
said Jane .	15225.41796251982
You are very cautious , I suppose , as to its being created .	5110.5149601583835
The feelings of the person who wrote , and the person who received it , are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circumstance attending it , ought to be forgotten .	4380.039181938972
My dearest Lizzy will , I am sure , be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment , at my expence , when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me .	4169.655621758159
though we can never be what we once were to each other .	6881.737755922011
in looking back to what they had feared , only two hours ago , she felt all the advantages of what they had gained .	5359.336673453664
Console Lady Catherine as well as you can .	10178.436969860899
Lizzy , said her father , I have given him my consent .	6183.958368978034
But good lord !	10689.807916629852
Hate you !	22757.11010138367
I pity , though I cannot help blaming her .	6355.155083872329
He left Netherfield for London , on the day following , as you , I am certain , remember , with the design of soon returning .	4701.403015960972
His sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own ;	7157.856397854449
Darcy was fixed in astonishment .	8927.156023641091
But slyness seems the fashion .	8717.40948337674
Are you quite sure , Ma'am ?	8588.389454941827
As I did the other day , said Elizabeth , with a conscious smile ;	6296.667230915219
And is such a girl to be my nephew's sister ?	6583.317109748045
His anxiety for Jane was evident , and his attentions to herself most pleasing , and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others .	4644.8643174615245
What I have to say relates to poor Lydia .	7533.300340507259
and though her resolution was not to be shaken , her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation .	4628.804096413628
Pray go to see them , with Sir William and Maria .	7619.791789110929
The only pain was in leaving her father , who would certainly miss her , and who , when it came to the point , so little liked her going , that he told her to write to him , and almost promised to answer her letter .	4226.559267097162
My dear Bennet , replied his wife , how can you be so tiresome !	4773.096389841659
Affectation of candour is common enough ;	12171.203962187625
of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt .	7716.627457159205
He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him , to lay his private actions open to the world .	4650.567921825971
The whole party have left Netherfield by this time , and are on their way to town ;	5035.183958688093
I know it to be impossible .	5380.440145429494
I have written to Colonel Forster , to inform him of our present arrangements , and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Wickham in and near Brighton , with assurances of speedy payment , for which I have pledged myself .	3816.9345291252466
What , has she frightened away some of your lovers ?	6874.284830777275
You have no compassion on my poor nerves .	5981.904244725893
She wanted to hear of him , when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence .	5319.707326747145
Are not you curious to hear how it was managed ?	7919.130814510194
Poor Wickham ;	18859.062262567415
for she had a lively , playful disposition , which delighted in any thing ridiculous .	5608.628336451017
What do you think ?	8174.244291988229
Her many attractions were again dwelt on , and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy , and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter .	4628.675454381223
She had instinctively turned away ;	6803.284283524992
Kitty , run down and order the carriage .	8524.131584079156
When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose , the tables were broke up , the carriage was offered to Collins , gratefully accepted , and immediately ordered .	4594.182533715791
I cannot blame myself for having done thus much .	5565.680560654076
Their situation was awkward enough ;	10732.537798782389
When you have killed all your own birds , Bingley , said her mother , I beg you will come here , and shoot as many as you please , on Bennet's manor .	4558.982827438152
and her expectations of advantage to her family , when in a happy humour , were so far beyond reason , that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day , to make his proposals .	4090.441122817996
Do not involve yourself , or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent .	4955.496185453209
There is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping , I dare say .	5476.700923647028
your name will never even be mentioned by any of us .	8086.499086453188
but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame .	6863.254556500518
Copyright laws in most countries are in a constant state of change .	8019.4483268181275
Can it be possible that he will marry her ?	8409.78539583371
Oh , no .	9205.692046869573
Bennet replied that he had not .	9239.932072485984
But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister , or say half that remained to be said , for the present .	4530.50261503723
My dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts .	4978.18639326409
All that is known after this is , that they were seen to continue the London road .	6021.504389244304
Good gracious !	13201.627108679078
You must learn some of my philosophy .	6610.006947624778
But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife , as I certainly did .	4120.478264614633
Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family ;	6622.246423286658
How shall we punish him for such a speech ?	7557.628388468594
and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house , walked quietly into it herself .	5055.463629828367
But wishes were vain ;	9555.414949952365
Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety ;	7540.469944632905
It ought to be good , he replied , it has been the work of many generations .	5183.071415141111
Lydia left a few lines for his wife , informing her of their intention .	6694.053404844078
His understanding and temper , though unlike her own , would have answered all her wishes .	5564.340751939668
But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about .	4733.577716540561
Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman , who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable .	4527.418566731801
He never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much ;	5198.372221219678
blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing .	6203.596487548915
She looked at her father to entreat his interference , lest Mary should be singing all night .	4956.352200133466
From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents .	6837.5597660977965
1 .	12212.55279990698
But however insincere you may choose to be , you shall not find me so .	5630.809961332958
I knew how it would be .	5889.332224499299
Why , my dear , you must know , Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England ;	4515.218265379825
Perfectly so I thank you .	13637.93872720995
and the girls had the pleasure of hearing , as they entered the drawing-room , that Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation , and was then in the house .	4110.317355423149
repeated Darcy contemptuously ;	17103.64478316344
and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling , was more openly acknowledged , for she did not scruple to call out , What is that you are saying , Fitzwilliam ?	4236.426395394867
Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined .	7095.650689534438
but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ;	5429.256267932543
Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Collins and myself on this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of another : of which we have been advertised by the same authority .	4743.8113906335175
and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love , and the object of that love , her friend Eliza , she sat herself seriously to work to find it out .	3880.972677692628
Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life ;	6283.21562912057
This is not quite enough to make her understand his character .	5903.194905473471
in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise , and where he was reduced to meet , frequently meet , reason with , persuade , and finally bribe , the man whom he always most wished to avoid , and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce .	4275.403844161219
You may ask questions , which I shall not choose to answer .	5565.899957141435
It is very unlucky ;	6652.154397014584
From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Darcy had been over-rated , Elizabeth had never yet answered Gardiner's long letter , but now , having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome , she was almost ashamed to find , that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as follows : I would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as I ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory , detail of particulars ;	3921.8981853582927
Your's , c .	10483.694660383553
I see your design , Bingley , said his friend .	5861.3314332156215
He will be forgot , and we shall all be as we were before .	5862.826188420423
E1 through 1 .	13655.09841630426
My dear , dear aunt , she rapturously cried , what delight !	5024.0895478376815
And gravely glancing at Darcy , There is a fine old saying , which every body here is of course familiar with 'Keep your breath to cool your porridge , ' and I shall keep mine to swell my song .	4411.068226519113
The Lucases are very artful people indeed , sister .	6907.696563388866
Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement , but was too much oppressed to make any reply .	5517.167903416794
You need not .	9673.897533790983
You have a sweet room here , Bingley , and a charming prospect over that gravel walk .	4864.949872526297
My fingers , said Elizabeth , do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women's do .	5048.95792500274
But it was her business to be satisfied and certainly her temper to be happy ;	4762.624924723117
Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there ( an invitation moreover including the whole party ) so immediately after your arrival !	5163.297768860251
At last she recollected that she had been travelling , and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance .	5474.39171864257
Her aunt asked her , smilingly , how she liked it .	6532.842124276981
it was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small fortune , and however uncertain of giving happiness , must be their pleasantest preservative from want .	4683.31805903602
and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her , she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both , and could very sincerely wish him happy .	4218.796123344145
At present I have not room to do them justice .	6588.788050756342
She studied every sentence : and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different .	5519.380895344105
I will think no more about him .	6003.631691149126
II .	29757.454875608575
The evening passed quietly , unmarked by any thing extraordinary .	6249.9388082859095
She found that she was to receive no other answer and , after a short pause , added , I think I have understood that Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again ?	4264.272158709422
She tried to recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence , that might rescue him from the attacks of Darcy ;	4719.008108710558
I comfort myself with thinking , replied Jane , that he certainly would not marry Lydia , if he had not a real regard for her .	4543.278849040267
When the gentlemen had joined them , and tea was over , the card tables were placed .	5384.1117069991005
The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541 .	6452.581786107462
They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world .	5843.691299860695
They agreed that Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct ;	5039.159667665204
Is that his design in settling here ?	9421.484216650915
My dear Jane !	8332.315575903507
I assure you , I feel it exceedingly , said Lady Catherine ;	4533.710604961948
I am quite well .	6026.021993879176
VOL .	22111.518280636905
I must think your language too strong in speaking of both , replied Jane , and I hope you will be convinced of it , by seeing them happy together .	4144.355354318546
and to see dear Wickham too !	6929.235720102335
It is well .	7477.649036229891
Miss Bingley made no answer ;	7368.708800998667
Lizzy is not a bit better than the others ;	8185.662073378451
will she be as tall as I am ?	10178.436969860899
His marriage was now fast approaching , and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable , and even repeatedly to say in an ill-natured tone that she wished they might be happy .	4552.538537325842
Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation .	6864.622790699386
Every time they met , it was more decided and remarkable .	7379.274450707688
and he scarcely opened his lips .	6295.582806471662
Her sister , however , assured her , of her being perfectly well ;	6341.184352567732
It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on such occasions it is the etiquette ;	4516.472338374133
My temper I dare not vouch for .	7976.191945291854
Anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn .	7118.395822855896
You have a very small park here , returned Lady Catherine after a short silence .	5022.541620458865
They lagged behind , while Elizabeth , Kitty , and Darcy , were to entertain each other .	5639.16605227134
it was really attentive ;	9542.08018455657
That you certainly shall .	10805.150761729272
and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance , were I distractedly in love with him , I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance .	4123.398727080853
her daughters , alarmed , anxious , uneasy .	9307.678121176566
but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer , larger picture of him than this .	5121.777144867933
While Mary is adjusting her ideas , he continued , let us return to Bingley .	6536.631796706741
If he did shrug his shoulders , it was not till Sir William was out of sight .	5131.267626218001
I do not get on at all .	4703.705814242992
What should not you mind ?	9974.31450364193
And since this sad affair has taken place , it is said , that he left Meryton greatly in debt ;	5291.827679004811
Let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many mortifications , for the sake of discovering them .	4223.044429450835
it is a handsome face .	9223.35976977414
Vain indeed must be all her attentions , vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself , if he were already self-destined to another .	5285.726180392146
I don't know .	9929.439968236367
One must speak a little , you know .	8475.622124613506
Who that knows what his misfortunes have been , can help feeling an interest in him ?	6404.8904492271095
and , while pretending to admire her work , said in a whisper , Go to your father , he wants you in the library .	4234.120191543065
Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character , and as she stood before the canvas , on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before ;	4307.300811665225
F1 .	29757.454875608575
I am perfectly satisfied .	5184.903040246386
Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure .	5351.423133677539
For we must attribute this happy conclusion , she added , in a great measure , to his kindness .	5527.4961541545945
With astonishment did Elizabeth see , that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself .	5800.37538903096
Section 2 .	22757.11010138367
Jane was beyond competition her favourite child .	7807.012512949946
When first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him ;	6258.974441886748
Mary wished to say something very sensible , but knew not how .	7260.198493524631
Perhaps , said Darcy , I should have judged better , had I sought an introduction , but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers .	5126.889477337068
If an individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are located in the United States , we do not claim a right to prevent you from copying , distributing , performing , displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg are removed .	3893.6522889986168
F4 .	29757.454875608575
Elizabeth coloured , and said A little .	7620.408611664521
She then yawned again , threw aside her book , and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement ;	4705.276717370599
Two days after Bennet's return , as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them , and , concluding that she came to call them to their mother , went forward to meet her ;	4479.917466084525
Email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and official page at <URL> For additional contact information : Gregory B Newby Chief Executive and Director gbnewby<MENTION> .	5021.797789694856
Elizabeth said no more but her mind could not acquiesce .	6462.250098191113
Collins , seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her , but Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine's being rather displeased by her staying at home .	4278.749559519306
on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree , for in Darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against another .	4797.0424472685645
It is Wickham's intention to go into the regulars ;	5507.693502605794
She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at , and it was rather too early to begin .	4722.161356773662
Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house ;	5924.2887780941455
and whether she wished or feared it most , she could scarcely determine .	5697.125996233682
and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss De Bourgh , which I am certain he has very much at heart .	4414.484856958215
its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines , crowded with the young and the gay , and dazzling with scarlet ;	5807.338335586568
who attended to you ?	13610.634645730977
Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way .	6267.221390070559
His character was decided .	9665.286850739754
was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs .	8195.593154054077
Come , Darcy , said he , I must have you dance .	7213.708879495195
but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , Gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible .	4136.373843825654
No , Lizzy , that is what I do not choose .	5842.71625400862
He is as fine a fellow , said Bennet , as soon as they were out of the house , as ever I saw .	3981.223121128286
and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford between our pools at quadrille , while Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh's foot-stool , that she said , 'Collins , you must marry .	4000.995914697662
They could describe an entertainment with accuracy , relate an anecdote with humour , and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit .	5117.299533631571
It would vex me , indeed , to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard .	4995.188469083098
Your cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings .	8299.259254153883
However , I recollected afterwards , that if he had been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for Darcy might have done as well .	4968.2609410728855
Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets ;	7949.127924732418
Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts , sarcastic humour , reserve , and caprice , that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character .	4350.960485800828
You are mistaken .	8453.754360376483
and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that Jane must soon cease to regard it , in the enjoyment of his .	4178.873038385261
Two inferences , however , were plainly deduced from the whole ;	7896.110836336737
Oh !	6826.5207498362
He is a gentleman ;	7318.979462457046
Believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention ;	6202.736098412629
and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh , I think it will be very tolerable .	4399.069828154051
Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin's praise ;	5595.797126076985
and returned no more , till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining-parlour .	5327.078352286638
and when she rose to take leave , Elizabeth , ashamed of her mother's ungracious and reluctant good wishes , and sincerely affected herself , accompanied her out of the room .	3852.1590965883397
She saw him start at this , but he said nothing , and she continued , You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it .	4180.182176439289
very true , it will be wise in me to refrain from that .	7675.0025176703875
No , replied Jane , I have not forgotten him ;	6348.789361046548
Every disposition of the ground was good ;	9298.066305493474
You never see a fault in any body .	7414.3898972737015
Consider Collins's respectability , and Charlotte's prudent , steady character .	8678.405711953168
I now give it to you , if you are resolved on having him .	5579.442132242234
Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy .	7417.38641081591
and as she named their relationship to herself , she stole a sly look at him , to see how he bore it ;	4231.924790656814
Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane ;	6077.934950565077
You write uncommonly fast .	10032.265768172017
Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation , but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view .	5652.4740343349495
In his present behaviour to herself , moreover , she had a fresh source of displeasure , for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance , could only serve , after what had since passed , to provoke her .	4231.437980747177
Well , that was very decided indeed that does seem as if but however , it may all come to nothing you know .	4849.733126424062
Mamma would like to go too of all things !	9475.89221511754
By tea-time however the dose had been enough , and Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again , and when tea was over , glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies .	4672.090952386305
Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family , she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort .	5151.759438274931
but she was proud of him .	5855.0436791270795
What are men to rocks and mountains ?	8042.866479421989
Well , much good may it do them !	6917.5375879233625
If he had not had a family of his own , I and my children must have had all his money you know , and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him , except a few presents .	4133.447197414674
They met several times , for there was much to be discussed .	6163.625619953843
The quiet , the retirement of such a life , would have answered all my ideas of happiness !	5253.076721494535
I only want to think you perfect , and you set yourself against it .	5389.424542641729
Of Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well ;	7198.402847685312
Chuse properly , chuse a gentlewoman for my sake ;	9475.89221511754
Among those who are at all his equals in consequence , he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous .	5578.31644002904
Those that best pleased her , as placing his conduct in the noblest light , seemed most improbable .	6265.805808646354
His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped , and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment , maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance , and except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth , requiring no partner in his pleasure .	4327.888694432373
Collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said , thanking her for every fish he won , and apologising if he thought he won too many .	4729.31845711157
I have been a disappointed man , and my spirits will not bear solitude .	4373.715985102137
They solaced their wretchedness , however , by duets after supper , while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister .	4386.6040006519925
for his chief wish at present , was to have as little trouble in the business as possible .	5625.67418627879
Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions , but answered them very composedly .	5595.797126076985
and their mother's fortune , though ample for her situation in life , could but ill supply the deficiency of his .	4727.44177544812
You must write again very soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last .	4649.949873703512
They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas ;	7921.065778832797
So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper , or her affectionate heart .	5571.153105208245
and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament ;	4421.615337650577
Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation , that he never again distressed himself , or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth , by introducing the subject of it ;	4902.250756687
At such an assembly as this , it would be insupportable .	6859.234707018445
From what can it proceed ?	10109.69489306373
Her father was walking about the room , looking grave and anxious .	6030.662221207162
The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion .	5974.1222063188825
my dear father , she cried , come back , and write immediately .	6124.142010683108
As to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say she could not positively answer but she did not know of any prepossession ;	4933.560971557458
I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed !	4905.480967856544
He has more to give .	7525.210984753954
An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched ;	9219.418420613907
Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to , it was not on her side a scheme of infamy .	6075.322162241101
Their taking her home , and affording her their personal protection and countenance , is such a sacrifice to her advantage , as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge .	4959.432778057594
and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes , but his eagerness to grasp at any thing .	4374.386693853144
I believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as I wished it in reason .	5351.209300373466
My sisters may write to me .	8840.302051330269
No , no , nonsense , Lizzy .	6443.658999657769
John told us Darcy was here when you sent for us ;	8422.884624479988
Not , however , from any fear of disadvantage from it , individually to herself ;	6258.277899656183
Many smiled ;	19460.212283037825
It is impossible .	6923.587079121458
She was convinced that she could have been happy with him ;	5251.352997530397
All !	22320.440282590156
While I can have my mornings to myself , said she , it is enough .	6204.730135517853
One day's delay she observed , would be of small importance ;	7545.408299509613
I flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so .	5719.627236165202
He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday , to say that he had arrived in safety , and to give me his directions , which I particularly begged him to do .	4531.661065052622
There could not exist in the world two men , over whom Darcy could have such boundless influence .	5560.583652864885
I never was .	7939.364366083015
Her uncle and aunt were all amazement ;	8362.898609556505
The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story , gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach ;	4800.106371799591
In 2001 , the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations .	4424.553321596428
and , as far as their acquaintance reached , there was no fault to find .	4584.461988119613
and , in the imprudence of anger , took the first opportunity of saying , with sneering civility , Pray , Miss Eliza , are not the shire militia removed from Meryton ?	4029.6996465497455
It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong ;	5061.5324046565165
I knew it to be a most respectable , agreeable corps , and my friend Denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters , and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them .	4115.150518370311
They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother .	5829.496094835582
They were able to love each other , even as well as they intended .	5366.1095800975345
Wickham will never marry a woman without some money .	7886.502815482323
That is the most unforgiving speech , said Elizabeth , that I ever heard you utter .	5119.707999083074
How despicably have I acted !	10018.264451649171
I am sure , said she , I cried for two days together when Colonel Millar's regiment went away .	3565.8748467564055
Then addressing her daughter , Oh !	10484.302473968193
she added , by far too much .	8835.140053431784
I know my own strength , and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming .	4726.781057890538
I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter , that I had known it , and purposely kept it from him .	4301.365687489179
He owns it himself without disguise .	8298.224421540943
and though , in looking forward , neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity , could be justly expected for her sister ;	4286.95733513605
Wickham's attention was caught ;	13793.400255143873
Excuse me for I must speak plainly .	10714.69959417815
cried Gardiner .	15561.44153493692
Your mother insists upon your accepting it .	8269.208580994333
so easy , that every servant will cheat you ;	8409.78539583371
Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself ?	9897.281842178145
You used us abominably ill , answered Hurst , in running away without telling us that you were coming out .	5230.559899905653
and all three being actuated by one spirit , every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled .	4880.215670014205
and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane ;	5062.002582179042
Oh !	6826.5207498362
He had always intended to visit him , though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go ;	4753.860625085061
Perhaps I am not doing her justice .	8815.48233735115
Oh !	6826.5207498362
How long has she been such a favourite ?	7987.847363929529
You had much better dance .	8555.77233449085
for she was in no cheerful humour .	7759.6530720922265
I certainly have had my share of beauty , but I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now .	4631.151598014338
Elizabeth asked questions in vain ;	9116.69839526504
I am sure I do not know .	3437.3852722395172
How wonderfully these sort of things occur !	8514.773361166099
Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure .	8422.884624479988
I am very glad to hear such a good account of her , said Lady Catherine ;	3941.595248970049
but I will make her know it .	6220.698973995483
I am sorry , exceedingly sorry , replied Darcy , in a tone of surprise and emotion , that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness .	3783.687159751752
But when they had withdrawn , he said to her , Bennet , before you take any , or all of these houses , for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding .	4211.784485607968
LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a defect in this electronic work within <TIME_PERIOD > of receiving it , you can receive a refund of the money ( if any ) you paid for it by sending a written explanation to the person you received the work from .	4479.162426466716
If she is half as sharp as her mother , she is saving enough .	5908.149958391196
and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate , she began to regret that he came .	4379.054642323645
If he no longer cares for me , why silent ?	6235.963721178425
and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town , as Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them , on their first coming to London , before they procured lodgings .	4097.294521662877
But I suppose you had no opportunity .	6014.00414319002
But Bennet , who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday , which would exactly finish Jane's week , could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before .	4359.788209943179
and , for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings , care not how much I may be wounding your's .	4184.787608320211
and lastly , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked .	4248.571689139363
that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders , and that the business had been compromised accordingly .	5768.730210718859
Bingley had not been of age two years , when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House .	5197.145827864796
Their journey was performed without much conversation , or any alarm ;	7213.34609467939
Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do .	6837.301928073808
but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us , if I had not perceived , by Jane's letter last Wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it , and therefore what I now tell you , can give you no fresh pain .	3879.30364955455
In the former were many good paintings ;	7207.225806490995
and if you can compass it , do cure the younger girls of running after the officers .	4454.055767164106
Collins will be very glad of your company , I am sure .	5987.30243164084
When he was gone , they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on , and their uncle promised , at parting , to prevail on Bennet to return to Longbourn , as soon as he could , to the great consolation of his sister , who considered it as the only security for her husband's not being killed in a duel .	3967.423242625816
and thirdly which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness .	4406.514284126699
Elizabeth shook her head over this letter .	7861.744818784409
Do your sisters play and sing ?	9663.752593329391
When the ladies removed after dinner , Elizabeth ran up to her sister , and seeing her well guarded from cold , attended her into the drawing-room ;	4619.901922121384
He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man ;	6288.444296192864
I hardly know how Collins was first introduced to her notice , but he certainly has not known her long .	5004.100372108296
and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters , and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense .	4334.18134965202
To Jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merit she had undervalued ;	5318.867669676782
It settled the matter ;	9817.914552147533
Collins might never make the offer , and till he did , it was useless to quarrel about him .	5650.428117324556
no , my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both .	6188.037819518384
It was more than civil ;	6440.647533705799
If it were merely a fine house richly furnished , said she , I should not care about it myself ;	4831.441032518914
She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man ;	5222.494420872563
Bennet deigned not to make any reply ;	8571.580401916404
Had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place ?	6722.783603893411
Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed , and , while her courage was high , she immediately said , Darcy , I am a very selfish creature ;	4962.056221305447
When Bennet wrote again to his brother , therefore , he sent his permission for them to come ;	5514.507480046289
but how could that be ?	8784.497221734367
And a special licence .	9929.775691276081
and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them , he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing , and called out to her , My dear Miss Eliza , why are not you dancing ?	4074.318243630344
Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all , but she could see it and write of it without material pain .	4640.829131620016
She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way .	4428.748851856392
Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from Charlotte , as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling .	4955.176956849348

Mary was obliged to mix more with the world , but she could still moralize over every morning visit ;	5814.887830500568
I am going to-morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality , who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him .	4016.0047529109697
and the good-natured wishes for her well-doing , which had proceeded before , from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton , lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances , because with such an husband , her misery was considered certain .	3964.1262119452726
Two offences of a very different nature , and by no means of equal magnitude , you last night laid to my charge .	5626.638683628551

Redistribution is subject to the trademark license , especially commercial redistribution .	8422.884624479988
but the emotion was short , and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued .	5014.1895489067965
Very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia , whose own misery was extreme , and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family .	4759.856859541333
Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable ;	7803.459243300347
Do you prefer reading to cards ?	8269.136331174746
where is your sash my dear ?	11276.841140791801
but I thought I might as well buy it as not .	5426.647484695817
But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together ;	5509.052651443443
CHAPTER III .	15231.67119605404
Soon after their return , a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet ;	8019.4483268181275
and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there , recurring to her mind , the few minutes in which they continued together , were some of the most uncomfortable of her life .	4171.439109387581
Jane listened with astonishment and concern ;	9548.108779207316
We must have Long and the Gouldings soon .	7450.489055917597
Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer ;	5863.733830935365
and while Sir William accompanied him , Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house , extremely well pleased , probably , to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's help .	4279.983357734867
He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance , but that is all .	5282.46223879577
It is the greatest of favours when Miss De Bourgh comes in .	5102.297043453492
They had long wished to see him .	6948.25576220611
At length the chaise arrived , the trunks were fastened on , the parcels placed within , and it was pronounced to be ready .	4959.099016524592
I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way .	4774.230359665938
for thither Collins had followed him after breakfast , and there he would continue , nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection , but really talking to Bennet , with little cessation , of his house and garden at Hunsford .	4383.323982685096
He , who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open pleasantry .	4927.809495726576
Compared with some families , I believe we were ;	9475.89221511754
In this room they were received by Miss Darcy , who was sitting there with Hurst and Miss Bingley , and the lady with whom she lived in London .	4610.118103040616
She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it ;	6026.318473477467
Do not give way to useless alarm , added he , though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain .	4509.7605840640435
but Collins , after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will , and should never resent her behaviour as any affront , seated himself at another table with Bennet , and prepared for backgammon .	4307.7720471381
A younger son , you know , must be inured to self-denial and dependence .	6283.061821209407
We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word .	6264.782199350533
Yes , or I will never see her again .	6377.50255863503
You have shewn him off now much more than he did himself .	5548.297825132511
From what we have seen of him , continued Gardiner , I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body , as he has done by poor Wickham .	4544.772482659543
She had known , it seems , of their being in love with each other , many weeks .	4732.984597159465
I have , Very well .	6128.503922769566
Through letters , whatever of good or bad was to be told , would be communicated , and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance .	5347.293945030259
It is fortunate , then , that they fall to my lot instead of to yours .	4759.748882521713
Tell him what a dreadful state I am in , that I am frightened out of my wits ;	6114.505767660021
The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings dreadful .	7675.607661452701
Because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement .	7840.8854740350325
She could not bear such suspense ;	6208.472969889719
And quite alone ?	11670.057232597592
Nor did that day wear out her resentment .	9042.069978313928
In ran Bennet to her daughter's room , in her dressing gown , and with her hair half finished , crying out , My dear Jane , make haste and hurry down .	4641.082137373033
what does he say ?	13310.858707401647
sir , I do indeed .	13637.93872720995
Is it true ?	14019.012238687255
They could not be untouched by his politeness , and had they drawn his character from their own feelings , and his servant's report , without any reference to any other account , the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known , would not have recognised it for Darcy .	4191.94389828098
but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right .	5940.1955457900885
What made you so shy of me , when you first called , and afterwards dined here ?	5759.534845002723
If it was not allowable for him to gain my affections , because I had no money , what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about , and who was equally poor ?	4285.703412780378
and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me .	5795.87454098685
Till this moment , I never knew myself .	9307.678121176566
She looked forward to their entrance , as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend .	4808.12247560413
He was not seated by her ;	6606.041329723589
a respectable-looking , elderly woman , much less fine , and more civil , than she had any notion of finding her .	5641.79099835442
but Elizabeth , less clear-sighted perhaps in his case than in Charlotte's , did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence .	4598.858219839852
who should do it but her own uncle ?	9219.418420613907
She respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his welfare ;	5141.673109619182
He is a sweet tempered , amiable , charming man .	5539.160894068802
I want to know , said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister's , what you have learnt about Wickham .	4553.146786891839
Such a disappointment !	13174.075129382953
It is often only carelessness of opinion , and sometimes an indirect boast .	5000.678467419091
I have just had a letter from Jane , with such dreadful news .	4628.3497911764325
Her heart did whisper , that he had done it for her .	6308.717627902003
Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet's general habits , she was absolutely incredulous here .	6329.085406828795
we will ask you no questions .	11106.934745442433
It was dated from Rosings , at eight o'clock in the morning , and was as follows : Be not alarmed , Madam , on receiving this letter , by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments , or renewal of those offers , which were last night so disgusting to you .	3889.9715516998476
Her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating .	6555.922367737725
When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen , they returned down stairs , and taking leave of the housekeeper , were consigned over to the gardener , who met them at the hall door .	4430.149744763845
cried Gardiner , whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive .	6158.804079486615
made no mention of the business that had taken him away , and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it .	5359.433745111083
for he was discovered to be proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased ;	5374.089763725174
Every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world ;	6264.843224535255
A few days after this visit , Bingley called again , and alone .	6481.166854237239
Elizabeth was determined ;	7882.94037120296
and then was enraged against herself for being so silly !	5509.640853595402
I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly .	5420.5406864243
Wickham , Lydia , were all forgotten .	8748.067706193804
Oh !	6826.5207498362
But it is fortunate , thought she , that I have something to wish for .	4762.787751958382
He has been here this half hour , and master has had a letter .	5138.482605325206
our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered ;	10714.69959417815
But I cannot I have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly .	4551.681363398943
Charlotte had hardly time to answer , before they were joined by Kitty , who came to tell the same news , and no sooner had they entered the breakfast-room , where Bennet was alone , than she likewise began on the subject , calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion , and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family .	4130.757536239055
I have not forgot , you see ;	4927.922452841038
and during part of that time , Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Bingley , who came from the dance for a few minutes , to press his friend to join it .	4248.5327585207
cried Elizabeth , when she had finished .	7006.038285948366
But every line proved more clearly that the affair , which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent , as to render Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous , was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole .	4165.961672487788
and had any thing of the kind been perceptible , you must be aware that ours is not a family , on which it could be thrown away .	4438.91032597446
Bennet , to whose apartment they all repaired , after a few minutes conversation together , received them exactly as might be expected ;	4848.373460864892
and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air , with such a companion .	4923.686798897872
Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening .	4701.263384726422
for , if I recollect right , he went but the day before .	5849.724355178556
The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire , you must know , was at a ball and at this ball , what do you think he did ?	4442.458567347418
the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me .	6016.015181068352
I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not .	4867.5052033252005
Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now .	6574.125769428314
It has often led him to be liberal and generous , to give his money freely , to display hospitality , to assist his tenants , and relieve the poor .	4484.688609943158
The discussion of Collins's offer was now nearly at an end , and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother .	4429.354648605483
and her invitation was accepted with alacrity .	6157.77765293371
On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn ;	7472.563007519983
Sir William Lucas , and his daughter Maria , a good humoured girl , but as empty-headed as himself , had nothing to say that could be worth hearing , and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise .	4295.486315265003
CHAPTER I Miss Bingley's letter arrived , and put an end to doubt .	6481.411718571002
Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph 1 .	6385.150238831472
and by a manoeuvre of Bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone , which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family .	4016.6489996506343
I know your disposition , Lizzy .	6308.052066219114
When the clock struck three , Elizabeth felt that she must go ;	5941.980898289365
And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth !	6000.043008055739
And I certainly never shall give it .	7496.245663150501
but we will hope at some future period , to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known , and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence .	4343.965382046388
But I have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected .	4797.693665032562
Young ladies of her age , are sometimes a little difficult to manage , and if she has the true Darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way .	4961.979241421313
to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before Collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery .	4573.658272566638
How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Darcy , for now they do appear wholly undeserved .	5065.806974302464
I understand that Collins has made you an offer of marriage .	5781.368380112012
Such was Miss Lucas's scheme ;	11428.51029114814
and she coloured at the idea ;	5636.068762547882
This room was my late master's favourite room , and these miniatures are just as they used to be then .	5466.575730804122
You promised me to insist upon her marrying him .	6501.033050302367
and I am sure if I had been you , I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it .	3996.0339166954973
At length , however , the question was asked by her uncle ;	5382.106215754568
Darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours .	6892.307595787621
She wished to discredit it entirely , repeatedly exclaiming , This must be false !	5582.869793461151
for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though George Wickham has treated Darcy in a most infamous manner .	4578.115466069301
This letter gave Elizabeth some pain ;	8946.505343161081
In marrying your nephew , I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere .	6011.727565152556
I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading !	6120.560123361791
I hope your plans in favour of the shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood .	4697.311902337776
I cannot misunderstand you , but I intreat you , dear Lizzy , not to pain me by thinking that person to blame , and saying your opinion of him is sunk .	4189.845942117866
Miss Bennet , I insist on being satisfied .	6990.938666595217
Oh !	6826.5207498362
Yes , she did .	8053.710211770907
How odious I should think them !	9173.610935774615
and if he had the fortune he ought to have , I should think you could not do better .	4517.629342401553
Unless where they like women of fortune , which I think they very often do .	6982.225423722116
CHAPTER IV .	11746.06741553873
She soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt , who did call on him in her return through London , and there relate her journey to Longbourn , its motive , and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth ;	4186.183426979737
but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her .	6336.537710604967
My sole dependence was on you ;	8840.302051330269
My fingers wait your orders .	9273.751421345049
As for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin Elizabeth .	4440.565986183045
Certainly .	24883.777684167606
who can it be ?	13610.634645730977
and much as she had always been disposed to like him , she could not think without anger , hardly without contempt , on that easiness of temper , that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends , and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations .	4020.723595900939
Since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and expedite a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with Wickham , he easily learnt , had never been his design .	4763.0551715184065
and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of or I may say , three very silly sisters .	4542.610209823042
you are a great deal too apt you know , to like people in general .	6814.618031925132
Before any answer could arrive from Collins , or any congratulations to Elizabeth , from his wife , the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas lodge .	5127.738511850746
His words seemed to imply it .	9101.685856896329
Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment , after such an affront to Colonel Forster ?	5786.900124986376
and Collins was to attend them , at the request of Bennet , who was most anxious to get rid of him , and have his library to himself ;	4357.44991044268
While thus engaged , Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ;	4887.455449668861
Perhaps there was some truth in this ;	9298.066305493474
was it so ?	16685.06169320472
I am glad of one thing , that he comes alone ;	4506.86201565286
He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before ;	5663.076154526503
She got up , and ran out of the room ;	6396.793409131783
There are a lot of things you can do with Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works .	4205.9653576217615
Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution ;	6324.441864878405
when he spoke , his accent had none of its usual sedateness ;	7376.989286876435
The darling wish of his sisters was then gratified ;	6907.696563388866
You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper .	5661.390212423066
She had been watching him the last hour , she said , as he walked up and down the street , and had Wickham appeared Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation , but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers , who in comparison with the stranger , were become stupid , disagreeable fellows .	3812.8026256682715
Money !	29757.454875608575
This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening , in summer ;	6010.357279593907
At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal , if he had not been well assured of his cousin's corroboration .	4187.976169251152
Ah !	22111.518280636905
The paling of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side .	6372.72806691619
But I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed .	4602.827274231046
1 .	12212.55279990698
she was aware that no one liked him but Jane ;	7233.988479162111
Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight ;	7652.153730092177
and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last .	4451.8899249684455
I defy even Sir William Lucas himself , to produce a more valuable son-in-law .	5579.442132242234
and not a day went by without a solitary walk , in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections .	4628.655352903258
and Elizabeth began to like them herself , when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for Jane .	4542.833704462632
The gentlemen came ;	10098.97354718217
I have seen them both .	5906.871343152583
I beg your pardon .	6975.043428174226
But there were other causes of repugnance ;	6874.382989988763
This , madam , is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together ;	5676.060924803279
and yet how many things have happened !	6571.909453715705
I only fear that the sort of cautiousness , to which you , I imagine , have been alluding , is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe .	4192.9993638680635
The one missent must be first attended to ;	7254.174979708635
and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia's connections , which is not likely , can I suppose her so lost to every thing ?	4232.388830327855
and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind .	4156.4088991492
and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal .	4807.319655397224
To the little town of Lambton , the scene of Gardiner's former residence , and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained , they bent their steps , after having seen all the principal wonders of the country ;	4376.234560232456
yet she received them with tolerable ease , and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment , or any unnecessary complaisance .	5285.89563768002
Come here , child , cried her father as she appeared .	7896.044134944185
Bingley , she had likewise seen for an instant , and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed .	5238.702645161526
They were , therefore , to go .	6774.030618917213
That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask .	5871.986217002384
I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere .	5516.276659979604
What are you telling Miss Bennet ?	8624.115493983754
It seems an hopeless business .	8389.42404244859
I hate such false friends .	7909.810216643001
He is come Bingley is come .	6850.86294791846
and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual , and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation .	4176.211666650473
I am not qualified to form one .	4547.749648264222
Yes , Ma'am , all .	7383.019041952122
She liked him too little to care for his approbation .	6560.498694651003
Oh !	6826.5207498362
CHAPTER VI .	11746.06741553873
I think not .	8217.213384984245
and then added , May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left and Collins well .	4670.407871300351
My dear Jane , I am in such a flutter , that I am sure I can't write ;	4514.504880624013
Where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant , distance becomes no evil .	6609.641255801309
She asked her at different times , how many sisters she had , whether they were older or younger than herself , whether any of them were likely to be married , whether they were handsome , where they had been educated , what carriage her father kept , and what had been her mother's maiden name ?	4089.346671290595
We can all plague and punish one another .	7605.01492692892
At length Darcy spoke , and in a constrained manner said , Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them , is less certain .	4431.185116063628
E1 .	22655.2237901027
Towards him I have been kinder than towards myself .	9475.89221511754
Indeed , Darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire and , give me leave to say , very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate , and such things may come out , as will shock your relations to hear .	4221.034730251061
Could she exert herself it would be better , but this is not to be expected ;	6318.278781685975
A glass of wine ;	11338.388268702625
She performed her part indeed without much graciousness , but Bennet was satisfied , and soon afterwards ordered her carriage .	5141.6447106657415
That is as it happens .	8102.337448254195
Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself , that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking , which ceased when he saw her no more ;	4444.324539410643
Maria would tell her nothing more , and down they ran into the dining-room , which fronted the lane , in quest of this wonder ;	5578.31644002904
Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly .	11054.031130354546
But , my dear sister , can I be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere ?	3868.8397812978174
All young ladies accomplished !	12782.678022054408
Yes , vanity is a weakness indeed .	6999.86353848315
Elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again , she wanted Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her .	5381.765660755602
but whether always charming , it is not for me to determine .	5859.511055163626
In short , I will do my best .	7380.161479407466
Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday ;	10344.268867353416
Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them ;	7509.095199899334
But this idea was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw Darcy walk into the room .	4502.230615304292
And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley .	6000.129172859369
till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of Bingley , and her being the sister of Jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding , made every body eager for another , to supply the idea .	4585.111295416863
Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service .	3963.487294039671
Are they indeed ?	15006.349358192352
And then , with a slight bow , turned again into the plantation , and was soon out of sight .	4951.842464610925
CHAPTER VIII .	13083.650239159624
She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do ;	4275.576077983404
I will take care of myself , and of Wickham too .	5281.240097712851
He addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet , with a polite congratulation ;	6212.350875696568
Between the two eldest and herself especially , there subsisted a very particular regard .	7229.449683182561
She was afraid of talking longer of his friend ;	5547.068633274052
I did not think you would ;	5354.625839685178
and as a punishment for him , as well as a possible advantage to Jane , she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Darcy's sister , as , by Wickham's account , she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away .	3953.342663615853
Take whatever you like , and get away .	9887.980455828847
Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year , which , unfortunately for his daughters , was entailed in default of heirs male , on a distant relation ;	4955.3981728964745
That he is as false and deceitful , as he is insinuating .	6185.528384355827
The whist party soon afterwards breaking up , the players gathered round the other table , and Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Philips .	4753.615600066233
Oxford , Blenheim , Warwick , Kenelworth , Birmingham , c .	8422.884624479988
The envelope itself was likewise full .	7926.033265046216
Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it ;	6020.125279612844
CHAPTER XV .	11746.06741553873
and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well .	4874.016213354004
cried Lydia .	14061.602163970252
The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit , and the result of it was , that the youngest should tax Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield .	4198.822227228716
You make me laugh , Charlotte ;	8409.953421908764
Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk ;	8409.78539583371
Did Charlotte dine with you ?	11589.491280092036
for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort springs from a breach of promise , for I ought not to have mentioned the subject ?	4989.7005289352055
And till Colonel Forster came himself , not one of you entertained a doubt , I suppose , of their being really married ?	5067.787248965736
They had several children .	8902.490203887852
But of every other neglect I can believe him capable .	6179.577895576142
and to complete the view , she saw herself seated beneath a tent , tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once .	4628.678257281671
I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance .	4742.586599383161
and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my cards .	4562.272638767663
While in their cradles , we planned the union : and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished , in their marriage , to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly unallied to the family !	4274.68658950582
It is not quite a week since they left Brighton .	4908.064775945023
I should not mind any thing at all .	5532.238611879941
You were Bingley's first choice .	8555.77233449085
I cannot see why Forster should not ask me as well as Lydia , said she , though I am not her particular friend .	4343.450576879346
Bingley was punctual to his appointment ;	8369.568001641945
my dear , dear Jane , I am so happy !	6594.371182362767
and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once .	4659.687818179577
So , do not put yourself to inconvenience .	8956.328896772115
And so , I suppose , they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead .	4651.811538426824
How I long to see her again !	6907.611604328171
To Pemberley , therefore , they were to go .	7670.243415672245
You have widely mistaken my character , if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these .	4807.119114731786
Here are officers enough at Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country .	6006.711494640652
But on the following morning , every hope of this kind was done away .	5459.605559307935
He was silent .	8178.3604727446
cried Wickham with a look which did not escape her .	7549.356219097958
I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's connections .	5906.674023758176
Well , if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own , so much the better .	4662.406580929879
Lady Catherine seemed resigned .	8446.168525900726
Your great men often are ;	10517.970518673485
He declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister's attachment ;	6212.202210402618
My dearest Lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Darcy , to be treating his father's favourite in such a manner , one , whom his father had promised to provide for .	4337.849436098795
Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks , online payments and credit card donations .	6509.535052087522
a report which highly incensed Bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood .	5978.160653802931
Do let me ask my partner to introduce you .	7523.32062623345
and while she steadily repressed it , could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing , that however long , and for whatever cause , his attentions had been withdrawn , her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal .	4056.8970287639318
my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken .	8365.10875384705
The next was in these words .	7595.893853867787
Her ladyship was highly incensed .	9208.616727774128
To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate !	6989.4044286989565
In this perturbed state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on ;	5332.209058682824
but , though she always kept a very good table , she did not think any thing less than two courses , could be good enough for a man , on whom she had such anxious designs , or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a-year .	3936.780894953243
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him ;	5237.440975273092
he has some friends , though perhaps not so many as he deserves .	6680.894685197689
They will ruin your happiness .	8636.673120858912
and at the age of twenty-seven , without having ever been handsome , she felt all the good luck of it .	4513.177860623306
From what I can collect , he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them .	5022.418568533795
Could she have seen half as much love in Darcy for herself , she would have ordered her wedding clothes .	5764.658973596717
The horses were post ;	9730.085984318766
Well , and what news does it bring ?	6583.522043957801
Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning , and writing to Jane , while Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village , when she was startled by a ring at the door , the certain signal of a visitor .	4012.131440687492
Thoughtlessness , want of attention to other people's feelings , and want of resolution , will do the business .	6348.646149877185
There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended ;	6195.29716506926
You doubt me , cried Jane , slightly colouring ;	7049.984339834933
The possibility of meeting Darcy , while viewing the place , instantly occurred .	5559.213583363337
No , that I am sure I shall not ;	5978.67379008599
and she made the most of the time , by visiting about with her daughter , and having very frequent parties at home .	4309.335123892291
But she had chosen it with her eyes open ;	5895.351994120683
He is nothing to us , you know , and I am sure I never want to see him again .	4305.750982218115
Lydia does not leave me because she is married ;	8323.962159463894
My love , should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much ?	5547.748335289384
Another intreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the desired effect ;	7126.307182033767
We have tried two or three subjects already without success , and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine .	5019.879522717278
Of course , we hope that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work .	4327.846559036934
and the girls smiled on each other .	5615.755713600726
and if she were married to him to-morrow , I should think she had as good a chance of happiness , as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth .	4060.810251235748
Your humility , Bingley , said Elizabeth , must disarm reproof .	7121.022620114257
How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own daughters I cannot understand ;	5542.910676219815
and her features are not at all handsome .	5912.057225911964
You observed it , Darcy , I am sure , said Miss Bingley ;	4643.534223842097
I know you will do him such ample justice , that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent .	4391.10241727668
It cannot last long .	8958.678567689318
no , no , this is not likely .	8956.420767391854
If he had another motive , I am sure it would never disgrace him .	5302.248968582286
Well , well , I only hope it will last .	5821.906520084709
In a fortnight they were to go , and once gone , she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account .	4735.966681301354
I appeal to Darcy : but let me not interrupt you , You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady , whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me .	4358.131524433941
And for this we are to be thankful .	7360.281986580576
Miss Bennet still looked all amazement .	8121.96071289735
She became jealous of his esteem , when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it .	5311.485098811546
but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming , she had no wish of her recovering immediately , as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield .	4473.286281256841
I was given good principles , but left to follow them in pride and conceit .	4857.212710709092
for though I am the youngest , I'm the tallest .	6676.88927961922
You are over scrupulous surely .	7194.458785218755
and she turned away with alarm , while Reynolds replied , that he was , adding , but we expect him to-morrow , with a large party of friends .	4154.712066220252
yes .	21381.54935835586
I thank you , again and again , for not going to the Lakes .	4989.006154027461
I know them a little .	6658.271961063799
and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send .	5362.814138271682
How could you begin ?	9694.524411445009
But I am at his disposal .	5553.137652300445
There was no help for it however .	6827.420661976765
Thank God !	19460.212283037825
It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth ;	5070.289520041762
oh !	29757.454875608575
what's his name .	18472.368653312184
and the pleasure of being with Charlotte , and the kind attentions she had received , must make her feel the obliged .	4346.885558870826
Well girls , said she , as soon as they were left to themselves , What say you to the day ?	4644.0915475657885
Why should they not go on to Scotland , if that had been the case ?	6069.559967671825
All that I can promise you , therefore , is not to be in a hurry .	6173.463743953641
My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly , to try to discover her .	5306.880187744207
I wish I could say any thing to comfort you , replied Elizabeth ;	4407.563448803133
But you know married women have never much time for writing .	5736.026079475028
it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited ;	5960.076429383567
And you saw the old housekeeper , I suppose ?	6507.64173844616
but Wickham was as far beyond them all in person , countenance , air , and walk , as they were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips , breathing port wine , who followed them into the room .	4298.698210433156
It was consoling , that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush .	4516.472338374133
Of his former way of life , nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself .	6003.0050761914645
there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her , and though by no means so clever as herself , she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her's , he might become a very agreeable companion .	4446.220403036922
he replied , and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled .	6112.838423171607
but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless .	5852.523110236429
But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment .	4368.310765190921
But I will not torment you with vain wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks .	4387.95065139044
but such of us as wished to learn , never wanted the means .	5949.419460425041
Yes , Sir ;	9127.274403465812
In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else , and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room .	4745.660963108966
Bingley urged Jones's being sent for immediately ;	8853.683421262138
though it was some time , I confess , before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice .	5520.097685326214
and from such as had been already visible below , she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcy's , in crayons , whose subjects were usually more interesting , and also more intelligible .	4190.679376380642
I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies .	5879.75777273302
The whole party before them , indeed , excited a lively attention .	5578.647715156586
I shall be back by dinner .	6050.44296755659
and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do .	4448.593893373081
You cannot have been always at Longbourn .	7323.751178410992
Well , my dear , said he , when she ceased speaking , I have no more to say .	4441.405872138842
and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view , as he meant to chuse one of the daughters , if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report .	4045.5688594878184
you mean Jane , I suppose because he danced with her twice .	7621.738380711583
Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor .	7360.118558413341
Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here ;	5375.463584132081
Ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either , detection could not be in your power , and suspicion certainly not in your inclination .	5566.805226098034
Not handsome enough to dance with !	9393.064414039094
Elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak ;	5317.625179372654
How Darcy looked , therefore , she could not tell .	7021.324167463066
Elizabeth was pleased , though , when she asked herself the reason , she had very little to say in reply .	4389.466728710393
Impossible , Bennet , impossible , when I am not acquainted with him myself ;	7229.501592966791
I told him , moreover , that I believed myself mistaken in supposing , as I had done , that your sister was indifferent to him ;	4460.42805747036
and still thought there might have been time enough .	6496.702865785345
I shall not be able to keep you and so I warn you .	4703.709703405267
My dear , dear Lydia !	5680.817066888236
It was owing to him , to his reserve , and want of proper consideration , that Wickham's character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was .	4090.177458612124
It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened .	5186.016174598601
Such a countenance , such manners !	9445.646793907743
Lydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself .	5761.270727909864
I know very well , madam , said he , that when persons sit down to a card table , they must take their chance of these things , and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object .	3896.5857408761776
While there was an officer in Meryton , they would flirt with him ;	6984.727009098058
they were dances of mortification .	11589.038034658804
CHAPTER XIII .	11746.06741553873
and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time .	4090.3493239462114
That is very true , said Elizabeth ;	5906.813928794791
But it was not to be .	5686.791325278452
Elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced ;	6734.286455412032
She was going to the butcher's , she told me , on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday , and she has got three couple of ducks , just fit to be killed .	4128.374334105769
she replied , endeavouring to recover herself .	8835.140053431784
The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time , and the plan became perfect as plan could be .	5025.476115937225
It is enough to know they are discovered , I have seen them both Then it is , as I always hoped , cried Jane ;	4290.232186186376
Only this ;	19838.46797603644
You judge very properly , said Bennet , and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy .	4896.872011332186
But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule .	4696.671692972794
I was only confused for the moment , because I felt that I should be looked at .	4718.669298368556
She began at length to recover , to fidget about in her chair , get up , sit down again , wonder , and bless herself .	4719.008108710558
her eldest daughter , she must just mention she felt it incumbent on her to hint , was likely to be very soon engaged .	5435.062893173286
No , I believe not .	8040.005248339233
VOL .	22111.518280636905
for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone .	6248.18895308073
The far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances .	5679.59176869076
but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts , fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one , with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance .	4233.296385803097
Pray write instantly , and let me understand it unless it is , for very cogent reasons , to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary ;	5093.25106586596
The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard , his claims on Darcy , and all that he had suffered from him , was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed ;	4492.70476799486
But when Elizabeth told of his silence , it did not seem very likely , even to Charlotte's wishes , to be the case ;	4636.30932264448
Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well-bred man , and talked very pleasantly ;	5518.579562337979
Into one house in this neighbourhood , they shall never have admittance .	8019.512307098883
But with me , it is not so .	6758.33136443253
Nor was it under many , many minutes , that she could comprehend what she heard ;	6390.7019300737975
It drew from her , however , the exertion of speaking , which nothing else had so effectually done before ;	5187.347824519217
Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied , Yes , you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that .	5008.664083108397
Her air was not conciliating , nor was her manner of receiving them , such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank .	5089.71045734219
When those dances were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by Darcy , who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him .	4261.996800277519
She was very equal therefore to address Bingley on the subject of the ball , and abruptly reminded him of his promise ;	4340.899559872416
Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning ;	4870.803789729576
When dinner was over , she returned directly to Jane , and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room .	4694.33638767607
This young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way , with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire , splendid property , noble kindred , and extensive patronage .	4822.64283948401
Kitty is slight and delicate , and Mary studies so much , that her hours of repose should not be broken in on .	5493.91042918182
But I have always observed , that they who are good-natured when children , are good-natured when they grow up ;	4455.452127015766
but she still thought him partial to Jane , and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend's permission , or being bold enough to come without it .	4224.930788887168
You must send John with the young ladies , Collins .	5861.422843329769
Pray read on .	15287.004648392136
CHAPTER XI .	13083.650239159624
but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it , and making her sister the excuse , said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book .	4490.583640332509
but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal ;	4923.518332866134
But we must stem the tide of malice , and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other , the balm of sisterly consolation .	4727.930652984892
the happiest , wisest , most reasonable end !	8550.871439833592
At that instant she felt , that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends , for moments of such painful confusion .	5074.769655180043
Not like the wild young men now-a-days , who think of nothing but themselves .	6444.546842646245
I believe she did and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object .	4723.144478111573
and Wickham , who happened to sit near Elizabeth , began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood , with a good humoured ease , which she felt very unable to equal in her replies .	4331.058228519821
and by her connivance and aid , he so far recommended himself to Georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement .	4099.878518118987
How much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book !	6248.696978331066
Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Darcy .	7417.38641081591
it cannot be .	13535.083913593906
His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own ;	6121.106748702151
he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield , and she blushed as she answered , I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family .	4600.017810480361
The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter , and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country .	4233.698381584888
What he means to do , I am sure I know not ;	6019.681391870357
Generous , good man , I am afraid he has distressed himself .	7841.135672810426
His doing so drew her notice .	9101.685856896329
The consequence of it is , that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have , and that Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever .	4669.803586596513
Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word .	5840.563689351042
Gardiner left them soon after breakfast .	9446.886193383778
To Darcy it was welcome intelligence Elizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough .	6495.009248978902
I knew how it would be I knew he would manage every thing .	4852.389508325417
a father absent , a mother incapable of exertion , and requiring constant attendance ;	6843.336213545967
It was then disclosed in the following manner .	5645.270348440537
Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay , as they had been at first .	5425.626573459602
I need not explain myself farther ;	7640.735496563357
his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do .	6593.53969665272
Indeed you must go , for it will be impossible for us to visit him , if you do not .	5195.020727349136
Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends , that could materially lessen its weight .	6175.077552967053
and her uncle and aunt , leaving her to enjoy them in quiet , set off by themselves .	4529.7660419890735
Well , he is a very undeserving young man and I do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now .	4510.294248409971
and now , I hope you are satisfied .	5882.813363448912
III .	29757.454875608575
In a doleful voice Bennet thus began the projected conversation .	6319.555669991388
But these , I suppose , are precisely what you are without .	5870.644972254283
She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love , rather than by his ;	4126.068233950339
for a few minutes he was silent ;	8443.823452504426
It is a long time , Bingley , since you went away , said Bennet .	4268.425332823232
no one was to be put in competition with him .	8162.747920787338
One has got all the goodness , and the other all the appearance of it .	6511.94252225271
the eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt , there cannot be two opinions on that point .	6054.872433632149
She answered him in the usual way , and after a moment's pause , added , My eldest sister has been in town these three months .	4585.923344663308
and Lady Lucas , who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken .	4406.43102632314
It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man .	4164.861538926064
Elizabeth , as she affectionately embraced her , whilst tears filled the eyes of both , lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives .	4355.748504540162
Long before it had taken place , my opinion of you was decided .	7400.109143036231
Dear , dear Lizzy .	14586.679524877369
But I can assure you , she added , that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy ;	4252.2529804953265
When , after examining the mother , in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Darcy , she turned her eyes on the daughter , she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment , at her being so thin , and so small .	4362.590830118993
The conduct of neither , if strictly examined , will be irreproachable ;	6162.242380864301
My mind was more agreeably engaged .	8546.691533546493
She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances , and she was in no humour to indulge him .	4599.987952222269
He had certainly formed such a plan , and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend .	4069.780698743686
True ;	26108.01995875992
whenever she was alone , she gave way to it as the greatest relief ;	7377.456950970888
The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner , and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank such affability and condescension , as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine .	4157.761968137894
And pray , Lizzy , what said Lady Catherine about this report ?	6374.112036612503
By the Author of Sense and Sensibility .	6150.880034801649
But of all the views which his garden , or which the country , or the kingdom could boast , none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings , afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house .	4113.958168168739
No thanks to his gallantry for that .	8703.868391904567
and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see Darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea .	4129.958690530162
Bennet , with great civility , begged her ladyship to take some refreshment ;	5771.508304811242
An unhappy alternative is before you , Elizabeth .	9219.418420613907
and while Darcy was attending them to their carriage , Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth's person , behaviour , and dress .	4506.744625450182
Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted ?	8142.098126783367
I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband ;	4747.252496774137
Believe her to be deceived by all means .	9686.967842588996
and though more astonished than gratified herself , by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her .	4043.07275855407
for she received an invitation from Forster , the wife of the Colonel of the regiment , to accompany her to Brighton .	5050.95000459903
It is almost past belief .	6507.312774570377
LIMITED WARRANTY , DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the Right of Replacement or Refund described in paragraph 1 .	5978.092048160421
The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements , with such news as the country afforded ;	5169.393395104246
Imagine our surprise .	18472.368653312184
but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded .	5333.740971165122
Good gracious !	13201.627108679078
and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world .	4550.879704971945
A low phaeton , with a nice little pair of ponies , would be the very thing .	5817.231766296972
Your coming to Longbourn , to see me and my family , said Elizabeth , coolly , will be rather a confirmation of it ;	5222.381840795609
I am ashamed of you !	5732.84659089822
He is rich , to be sure , and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane .	4684.846934150493
Miss Darcy , though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations , readily obeyed .	5223.52432398296
he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire , and Jane and Elizabeth , in addition to every other source of happiness , were within thirty miles of each other .	4771.717652750173
That he was surprised by the connexion was evident ;	6625.803221897278
A clear ten thousand per annum .	9312.947839979217
My dear Bennet , you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother .	4554.305163476579
This is the only point , I flatter myself , on which we do not agree .	5263.63039884165
Four nieces of Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means ;	7981.115952331997
Till I can forget his father , I can never defy or expose him .	6693.813461842467
But now several minutes elapsed , without bringing the sound of his voice ;	5506.546685706864
had I known what I ought , what I dared , to do !	7674.886508350777
that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance !	7237.240533045878
Her power was sinking ;	10877.465746757922
1 .	12212.55279990698
and perhaps he might be doing the same .	6792.738636346012
Yes , he had no engagement at all for to-morrow ;	6140.680172522109
When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night , she followed her , and made the important communication .	5466.636113938921
Yes , very indifferent indeed , said Elizabeth , laughingly .	5881.495268643951
Miss Elizabeth Bennet !	13016.450434655362
Elizabeth most thankfully consented , and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay , and bring back a supply of clothes .	4798.719359066713
Gardiner declared his willingness , and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation .	6681.096627112953
CHAPTER XIV .	11746.06741553873
I have no such injuries to resent .	5235.706691937591
but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion , suffered no variation of colour .	5097.995804709573
Oh , Lydia !	9629.754343160064
But now it was all too natural .	6595.3358421369385
but he seemed to like his second better .	6303.305922741744
My dear sir , replied Collins , I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship's concurrence .	4310.921480151922
make haste , my love .	13144.561671774996
and he thought it an excellent one , full of eligibility and suitableness , and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part .	4448.593893373081
He enquired in a friendly , though general way , after her family , and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done .	4730.449801996685
and why not to me ?	8151.016450208518
If he fears me , why come hither ?	6777.445505391298
That will make thirteen with ourselves , so there will be just room at table for him .	5597.151600045074
Oh !	6826.5207498362
there were half hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte , and the weather was so fine for the time of year , that she had often great enjoyment out of doors .	4948.023255926595
Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form , he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing ;	4967.139329439508
No officer is ever to enter my house again , nor even to pass through the village .	5843.759740099631
Bennet , in short , was in very great spirits ;	6345.4374236109625
As a child I was taught what was right , but I was not taught to correct my temper .	5304.394128745566
he drew back his chair , took a newspaper from the table , and , glancing over it , said , in a colder voice , Are you pleased with Kent ?	4865.518519105488
And there are several of the young men , too , that she likes very much .	5377.573949789205
You are then resolved to have him ?	6434.294574205256
Wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates ;	5340.114583323848
You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I hope , though you have but a short lease .	4685.705416084939
They met again on Sunday , and then I saw him too .	6304.042014467767
and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition .	3954.735289742219
You will not be fit to be seen when you get there .	5347.023948205895
The period of expectation was now doubled .	7675.607661452701
Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject .	5312.83091839176
I am going away myself .	5274.860306348956
that is rather singular .	12303.601733664473
But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed ;	6516.893477189978
It was an encouragement of vice ;	5775.512116368194
Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so , said Collins very gravely but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you .	5227.038720603167
I leave it to yourself to determine , said Bennet .	6120.560123361791
Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the expression of heart-felt delight , diffused over his face , became him ;	4915.480645267566
No .	19090.12688899082
Now , Lizzy , I think I have surprised you .	7703.055373663018
she repeated .	15812.219611248753
Upon my word , said her Ladyship , you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person .	4978.055790930358
I certainly saw Darcy speaking to her .	6703.160995807577
He did not leave his name , and till the next day , it was only known that a gentleman had called on business .	4564.0642607837
If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other , or ever so similar before-hand , it does not advance their felicity in the least .	4655.325667848009
I see what you are feeling , replied Charlotte , you must be surprised , very much surprised , so lately as Collins was wishing to marry you .	4448.661422808715
But are you pleased , Jane ?	8075.492646678731
do any thing rather than marry without affection .	9533.988474411917
CHAPTER XIX .	11746.06741553873
Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his countenance .	7170.921742461265
Certainly , my dear , nobody said there were ;	8324.997092146357
You know my sentiments .	8124.861543835941
that the young man's marrying her , was a patched-up business , at the expence of your father and uncles .	5570.219909437831
In the intervals of her discourse with Collins , she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth , but especially to the latter , of whose connections she knew the least , and who she observed to Collins , was a very genteel , pretty kind of girl .	4122.183161670296
She talked to Elizabeth again and again ;	7360.325882813912
Miss Bennet had slept ill , and though up , was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room .	5073.119114459897
Lady Catherine it appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings , for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Darcy .	4611.2692259469395
How are you all ?	10692.818904125765
How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning , Darcy , she cried ;	6419.753423167509
I should say , one of her ladyship's carriages , for she has several .	5013.794848985772
and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time .	5104.712268856491
How grievous then was the thought that , of a situation so desirable in every respect , so replete with advantage , so promising for happiness , Jane had been deprived , by the folly and indecorum of her own family !	4458.6223838092565
for though dilatory in undertaking business , he was quick in its execution .	6024.490381449241
and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet .	3995.092683835008
and if a smart young colonel , with five or six thousand a year , should want one of my girls , I shall not say nay to him ;	4242.46653057838
and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance .	4867.767176992906
I send no compliments to your mother .	7192.436393339187
I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow .	4108.564867806486
Your younger sisters must be very young ?	8872.792519716419
It was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for Longbourn , before she told her sister of Darcy's proposals .	4159.287318629939
Collins , awkward and solemn , apologising instead of attending , and often moving wrong without being aware of it , gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give .	4418.117307323061
But , though this might be imaginary , she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy , who had been set up as a rival of Jane .	4102.661426733478
Now , Kitty , you may cough as much as you chuse , said Bennet ;	5968.679012976033
No , indeed .	9683.489207410801
All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over .	8285.842993422688
Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy .	8224.507098888129
and then , unwilling to let the subject drop , added , He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire , I understand .	4314.710336597765
Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father , their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility .	5151.4130555762395
and if she would give him leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them .	4519.637700740422
I should be sorry , you know , to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire .	4061.9335995394304
And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry ?	7193.667351437841
But it must not , shall not be .	6024.945184328674
and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park , hurried home with the great intelligence .	4728.575134278155
After abusing you so abominably to your face , I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations .	5480.547070374743
Lizzy , said he , I was going to look for you ;	6007.356643020418
cried Elizabeth , darting from her seat as she finished the letter , in eagerness to follow him , without losing a moment of the time so precious ;	4548.644401655215
Her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction ;	4777.493456121
From the farther disadvantage of Lydia's society she was of course carefully kept , and though Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her , with the promise of balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going .	4417.76429147529
I do not at all know ;	4508.07862963996
Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield and looked in vain for Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her .	4955.361682079513
Good Heaven !	15987.831621001465
After playing some Italian songs , Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air ;	6075.887310570626
and when I next write to her , I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account .	4482.145159563866
Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought , said Bennet ;	6257.275122536364
and with many men , I dare say , it succeeds .	5210.606626948489
Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency .	7549.376498952938
Will you be very angry with me , my dear Lizzy , if I take this opportunity of saying ( what I was never bold enough to say before ) how much I like him .	4734.173483738489
and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend .	4648.2425082358695
I am glad I bought my bonnet , if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox !	4149.514161659799
That the wish of giving happiness to you , might add force to the other inducements which led me on , I shall not attempt to deny .	4907.065970609899
and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment ;	5555.003803007658
but she , who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible , gaily continued , Oh !	4590.337584021115
Surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement .	8901.060544562486
and in spite of his being a lover , Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity , to be rationally founded , because they had for basis the excellent understanding , and super-excellent disposition of Jane , and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself .	3794.4705268112925
CHAPTER XXIII .	15231.67119605404
On the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband .	5558.212690840093
And who is there , whatever might be their former conduct , that she would believe capable of such an attempt , till it were proved against them ?	4738.539345237862
It was an earnest , steadfast gaze , but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind .	4141.297633601079
I will only add , God bless you .	5609.667835104289
of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance !	10480.309882130758
Wickham , perhaps , is my favourite ;	8748.067706193804
and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage , she may have less trouble in achieving a second ;	4022.8085507076216
Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder , and when at last Collins allowed him time to speak , replied with an air of distant civility .	4812.26607703539
But , my dear , your father cannot spare the horses , I am sure .	3916.7068381564823
His complexion became pale with anger , and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature .	5629.166839842675
It would be such a delicious scheme , and I dare say would hardly cost any thing at all .	4409.828088518674
She would not give him time to reply , but hurrying instantly to her husband , called out as she entered the library , Oh !	4584.146975856763
mamma , do the people here abouts know I am married to-day ?	8019.4483268181275
She is well , and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother .	4993.97445542808
Oh !	6826.5207498362
A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe .	5480.923571724346
Perhaps she is full young to be much in company .	7733.929680100861
I know very well that nothing can be done .	5165.020291323267
She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool ;	5769.235715043941
Bennet , how can you abuse your own children in such a way ?	5896.131106887294
You refuse to obey the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude .	5948.584444412819
It is a circumstance which Darcy of course would not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady's family , it would be an unpleasant thing .	3914.1556569012223
but to say the truth , I was too cross to write .	5825.127522254776
that she is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference , and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him , she means ( most kindly ) to put me on my guard ?	4736.868215679129
for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ;	5252.988309875455
You have no regard , then , for the honour and credit of my nephew !	5091.715145776799
There was no arguing upon such a project .	6506.755689691398
But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue , she could easily conjecture .	4554.616220905944
But the person who advanced , was now near enough to see her , and stepping forward with eagerness , pronounced her name .	4636.136098892041
As she went up stairs to get ready , Bennet followed her , saying , I am quite sorry , Lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself .	4500.7437989001655
He heard her with astonishment .	8040.256658901151
but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets , she soon grew too much interested in the game , too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes , to have attention for any one in particular .	4370.188341342251
She is my youngest girl but one .	6235.405864089816
Lydia came to us ;	12870.989799484363
Every body was surprised ;	11649.035899392698
Her performance on the piano-forte is exquisite .	8106.088669800178
Elizabeth , construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister , was pleased ;	4917.851430760323
I did hear , too , that there was a time , when sermon-making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present ;	4378.175861033714
I must find Gardiner this moment , on business that cannot be delayed ;	5163.310471715946
And with a low bow he left her to attack Darcy , whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched , and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident .	4558.202321752021
she had no conversation , no style , no taste , no beauty .	6348.281865269595
If your feelings are still what they were last April , tell me so at once .	5630.775475773514
In pompous nothings on his side , and civil assents on that of his cousins , their time passed till they entered Meryton .	5145.5820042063015
and in his manner of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment , reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh , and trusting their opinion of her their opinion of every body would always coincide , there was a solicitude , an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard ;	3769.139151290855
Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case , unknown to the society of Hertfordshire ;	4769.807238970712
Bingley and Jane were standing together , a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other .	5182.397149082206
Does that young lady know Darcy ?	11276.841140791801
I shall not sport with your impatience , by reading what he says on that point .	4514.473851057508
But whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ;	4463.624101351838
That such a consequence as this should ensue , you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts .	5566.1297747596245
Pray tell your sister that I long to see her .	7471.427020274984
A single man of large fortune ;	9313.059290202786
It was the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton , and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace .	4168.26695771095
and if they are not married already , make them marry .	5230.050660017219
and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend .	4415.710003003095
Her father captivated by youth and beauty , and that appearance of good humour , which youth and beauty generally give , had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind , had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her .	4212.730530851496
and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men .	4169.539640915583
My good , kind brother !	9034.477749420343
Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character , but said nothing .	5737.320294513425
If my children are silly I must hope to be always sensible of it .	5993.704515483156
It was the favourite wish of his mother , as well as of her's .	4665.078757266946
How could I be so silly as to wish it !	6323.170439735818
Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you , as his father did before him ?	6221.050442355683
The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family .	6093.600238043574
In another minute Bingley , but without seeming to have noticed what passed , took leave and rode on with his friend .	5142.864777657141
I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family .	4388.343090903526
I can readily believe , answered he gravely , that report may vary greatly with respect to me ;	4786.893700010986
Perhaps other people have said so before , but not one with such justice .	6592.853950967603
I speak feelingly .	9492.18051552772
Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth , this was not the best method of recommending herself ;	6348.646149877185
I did not know before , continued Bingley immediately , that you were a studier of character .	4155.124461325729
Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ;	10491.204892994789
I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for I am fond of superior society ;	4871.991828229147
I always had a value for him .	6819.137862088858
You will easily comprehend , from these particulars , that Wickham's circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be .	4689.6980868984765
and Jane , who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience , from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit , was delighted at her entrance .	4279.1892119960075
My dear Friend , If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me , we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives , for a whole day's t te- -t te between two women can never end without a quarrel .	4034.327126491009
Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife .	7419.651661513435
She is a great deal too ill to be moved .	4812.475178970917
On distinguishing the ladies of the group , the two gentlemen came directly towards them , and began the usual civilities .	5474.36260604151
You could scarcely escape discredit and misery .	7323.751178410992
They stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece , who , astonished and confused , scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face , and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family .	4276.8884582438295
Elizabeth made no answer .	6546.530854994929
They were forced to conclude , that he had no pleasing intelligence to send , but even of that they would have been glad to be certain .	4415.61810598546
One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight .	6195.776619548715
I do not believe a word of it , my dear .	4011.3891916214234
we must forget it ourselves .	12342.318502566179
And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman .	5387.9286046501975
Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party .	6996.881214425653
What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory , and as she recalled his very words , it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other ;	4458.757930272795
They now walked on in silence ;	8774.131301208306
Jane resolutely kept her place at the table ;	8266.551278532608
then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms .	7512.894384124344
Are you going much farther ?	10036.1364796403
I have met with two instances lately ;	5617.870043624773
I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy .	4807.528612897081
for I dare not hope , he continued in a lower and more serious tone , that he is improved in essentials .	5050.975909895864
Do you often dance at James's ?	8269.136331174746
In anticipating the happiness of Bingley , which of course was to be inferior only to his own , he continued the conversation till they reached the house .	4687.648286035023
Indeed , Bennet , said she , it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that I should be forced to make way for her , and live to see her take my place in it !	4206.9435106046
And Mary King is safe !	9366.184262752702
Jane ran to her uncle and aunt , and welcomed and thanked them both , with alternate smiles and tears .	5234.884675559573
By all means , cried Bingley ;	9896.455155263207
After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence , health , good humour and cheerfulness began to re-appear at Longbourn .	5392.450209475056
and Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again , whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them .	4401.531276469284
Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off .	7043.39637270295
if he were so , they could not succeed .	8717.13657111397
her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances , and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else Darcy was condemned as the worst of men .	5219.402549780425
In a few days Bingley returned Bennet's visit , and sat about ten minutes with him in his library .	4801.3322214870595
and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister , and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them .	4242.679929246737
Besides , there was truth in his looks .	10178.436969860899
but at any rate , was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal .	5669.526495876741
were questions with which she amused herself .	11054.031130354546
I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind .	5056.466770409197
But , however , he is very welcome to come to Netherfield , if he likes it .	4613.774402143637
A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty ;	5493.469247313145
But Gardiner , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in her hopes as her fears ;	4492.892263212294
She then hastened away to her mother , who had purposely broken up the card party , and was sitting up stairs with Kitty .	4611.818772602876
and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Denny , to whom Lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned ;	3862.6060383205568
but to her own more extensive information , he was the person , to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as what Jane felt for Bingley .	4062.8443985022727
What would I give to hear your strictures on them !	6998.94041962452
Lizzy , said he , what are you doing ?	6883.4511756271295
You will find her manners beyond any thing I can describe ;	5787.231750930566
I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had .	5512.911550382535
What an agreeable man Sir William is , Bingley is not he ?	6476.436112009966
I always said it must be so , at last .	5861.226264217236
People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking .	6676.979685876215
Though Lydia had never been a favourite with them , and Gardiner could not but be deeply affected .	6021.67813543592
But so they always are .	8402.041456876663
But to be sure , the good lady who shewed us the house , did give him a most flaming character !	4735.548019835699
He was most highly esteemed by Darcy , a most intimate , confidential friend .	5112.947479875077
Not to appear to disgrace his family , to degenerate from the popular qualities , or lose the influence of the Pemberley House , is a powerful motive .	5001.1970721140815
It is too long ago .	6507.312774570377
No , my dear ;	8394.646958051542
Annesley is with her .	15633.167043926136
Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they admired her and liked her , and pronounced her to be a sweet girl , and one whom they should not object to know more of .	4491.002356533394
but since he had been in the militia , it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them .	4710.243213376105
I do not believe Long will do any such thing .	4257.3184863465
Ten thousand a year !	12550.474223390489
but allow me to assure you that I have your respected mother's permission for this address .	5429.327142713792
Darcy sends you all the love in the world , that he can spare from me .	5901.7972833519625
Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk , they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance , and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance .	4691.3468991653635
Yes ;	11624.632075734577
Is not he a charming man ?	9662.139338339086
Oh , Lizzy !	8412.633737715443
I came to try you .	7623.658551659313
Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes .	7386.562416151702
His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same , said Elizabeth angrily ;	5748.00404479106
which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption , she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister , had been formed before he quitted the inn , and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there , had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend .	4370.515479887635
You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing .	5787.231750930566
We shall be at Newcastle all the winter , and I dare say there will be some balls , and I will take care to get good partners for them all .	4573.474410684946
They have known her much longer than they have known me ;	6418.505218900557
What say you , Mary ?	9974.31450364193
and Charlotte , detained first by the civility of Collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear .	4230.90780826476
She was at least free from the offence of Darcy's farther notice ;	5132.717354118213
and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close ;	4416.67201331231
Read it aloud , said their father , for I hardly know myself what it is about .	6689.083955578271
But really , Ma'am , I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters , that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early .	4260.319527686584
The present always occupies you in such scenes does it ?	6452.581786107462
You do not look well .	7714.282324800147
Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this , but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head .	4499.303680948781
You are severe on us .	7194.458785218755
and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me , because you have always so much .	4491.150881644257
Very true , my dear , that is exactly what I say .	6530.6911039461065
Collins was punctual to his time , and was received with great politeness by the whole family .	5452.000961415712
One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man , with family , fortune , every thing in his favour , should think highly of himself .	5122.5437349648355
and if you persist in indifference , do not make me your confidante .	4691.1895977800295
and when occasionally , unable to resist the impulse of curiosity , she raised her eyes to his face , she as often found him looking at Jane , as at herself , and frequently on no object but the ground .	3938.2037289635095
My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this .	6479.878595841566
Elizabeth longed to explore its windings ;	7864.3018275564245
and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of , she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours .	4564.477870742056
You are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room , said Darcy , looking at the eldest Miss Bennet .	4679.616969094648
But you are always giving her the preference .	6201.608555733692
I am confident that she would have performed delightfully .	5018.956511616216
You shall not defend her , though it is Charlotte Lucas .	6229.3379557430835
Darcy is impatient to see his sister , and to confess the truth , we are scarcely less eager to meet her again .	5072.923304048852
After this period , every appearance of acquaintance was dropt .	7299.6014076486435
As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not , she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind .	4780.375536563827
how I wanted you !	12098.559385787303
She wrote again when the visit was paid , and she had seen Miss Bingley .	5428.417442244486
This cannot be !	12818.617838552687
What think you of books ?	8930.48773620072
But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them .	6053.371884152351
And yours , he replied with a smile , is wilfully to misunderstand them .	6000.086090302876
His accompanying them was a double advantage ;	8453.130565045667
and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness .	4444.098450661582
On such encouragement to ask , Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away .	5399.614386827573
While these newly-born notions were passing in their heads , the perturbation of Elizabeth's feelings was every moment increasing .	5909.864286065692
This letter is from Collins .	9748.008126485367
Darcy , on the contrary , had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion , for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest , and from none received either attention or pleasure .	4217.1416415294125
but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas .	4833.314261945272
his society was irksome , and his attachment to her must be imaginary .	7052.07429180571
It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ;	4273.864778312132
Bingley replied that he did , and made his congratulations .	7432.235133113246
Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at Brighton .	5697.899657276772
But that gentleman , looking at Darcy , seemed to think the country was nothing at all .	4947.480419350453
An airing would do me a great deal of good , I am sure .	5531.777775342441
Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew ;	5787.366628140686
and on her pausing , he asked her , if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends .	4591.583380771587
and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her , the worth of each was eclipsed by Bingley and Netherfield .	4215.21882637942
No , nothing at all .	7549.305029348069
The turn of your countenance I shall never forget , as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way , that would induce you to accept me .	4562.839627426381
Yes , almost every day .	7462.497816012928
but Bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished , was excessively disappointed .	5070.570671758314
I desire you will stay where you are .	5908.819693685024
though their kindness to Jane , such as it was , had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration .	5172.90784355211
How could his will be disregarded ?	8173.344862220114
Collins readily assented , and a book was produced ;	7803.459243300347
Darcy corroborated it with a bow , and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth , when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger , and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other , was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting .	4159.23700256406
It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now .	5327.620796159758
She dared not relate the other half of Darcy's letter , nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend .	4703.630056734751
On entering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo , and was immediately invited to join them ;	5495.081364155424
Lydia , my love , though you are the youngest , I dare say Bingley will dance with you at the next ball .	5096.255527289934
The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth .	6907.696563388866
She was sorry that Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them ;	4530.081573535183
The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , cake , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ;	4515.533742814049
She had always seen it with pain ;	5948.617644873049
I cannot do justice to his kindness .	5798.675858968468
Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party .	6225.236246416528
Your conjecture is totally wrong , I assure you .	6848.444659414391
and Lydia , self-willed and careless , would scarcely give them a hearing .	5377.17321103062
Hurst looked at her with astonishment .	10381.775955867382
As soon as ever Bingley comes , my dear , said Bennet , you will wait on him of course .	4494.6705714170075
Indeed I do not dare .	10388.900578349221
But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence .	7160.917178371429
But she is perfectly amiable , and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies .	4664.939690780061
and she thought , more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire , than as she had seen him at Pemberley .	3831.0235688191333
to Miss Lydia Bennet , ' without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or any thing .	5178.511752155242
but satisfying them instantly on that head , she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons , reading the two letters aloud , and dwelling on the postscript of the last , with trembling energy .	4462.855900383992
I should like balls infinitely better , she replied , if they were carried on in a different manner ;	4533.726379915011
and as Miss Bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to Wickham , Georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more .	4115.118175988371
He can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear .	5745.164357763791
There was too much to be thought ;	7201.172616679637
and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind , wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite .	4349.2951209657085
What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant ?	6623.925947419196
But my dearest love , tell me what dish Darcy is particularly fond of , that I may have it to-morrow .	4891.431507865712
My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect .	6089.616461421465
I dare say I shall soon see them here .	5640.046159858499
While the family were in this confusion , Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them .	6188.192201091237
and in the nearness of the Parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lived in it , the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day .	3894.3394353899757
while his sisters , convinced that no country advice could be of any service , recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians .	5488.236868023209
She was overpowered by shame and vexation .	5776.243493285353
Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town ;	6326.031037042245
there is nothing in that .	10449.351979229663
Why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ?	5257.064608204469
Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow , and though she could not hear a word of it , she felt as if hearing it all , and saw in the motion of his lips the words apology , Hunsford , and Lady Catherine de Bourgh .	4235.32356974421
and when the subject was revived the next morning , and she was again applied to , could readily answer , and with a proper air of indifference , that she had not really any dislike to the scheme .	3995.907654649292
and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints , they parted ;	4920.3737122618795
For God's sake , say no more of his partners .	7733.929680100861
Whatever he said , was said well ;	9730.890640642254
They are gone off together from Brighton .	6901.981250349551
He knows of my being in town , I am certain , from something she said herself ;	5195.460418851148
He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant .	7329.953745640528
The prospect of such delights was very cheering , and they parted in mutual good spirits .	5353.688495375292
she still expected that it would all end well , and that every morning would bring some letter , either from Lydia or her father , to explain their proceedings , and perhaps announce the marriage .	4644.643525671067
Perhaps he had been civil , only because he felt himself at ease ;	6574.026400098388
and indeed I am quite of your opinion .	6598.897952271818
he will rant and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter .	5327.921487951901
Lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in Bingley's way .	5674.878450984042
You may remember what I told you on that point , when first we talked of it .	5026.208492744963
And they must marry !	9929.775691276081
Consider how important every moment is , in such a case .	8224.576574953253
From something that he told me in our journey hither , I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him .	5504.038758323141
Indeed , Collins , all praise of me will be unnecessary .	6870.620095310746
I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well , when she came into the room this morning .	4939.825245205936
My conduct may I fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own .	5352.434237592553
his style was not penitent , but haughty .	9073.822579829268
And even Mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it .	5879.753984515254
and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it .	4859.478326674364
Though she dared not depend upon the consequence , she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour .	6166.693938357269
On being made acquainted with the present Darcy's treatment of him , she tried to remember something of that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad , which might agree with it , and was confident at last , that she recollected having heard Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud , ill-natured boy .	4212.423912725116
To all the objections I have already urged , I have still another to add .	6120.515807289354
There was another reason too for her opposition .	6836.876486224304
for she only came , I suppose , to tell us the Collinses were well .	5718.3228243895355
I am only resolved to act in that manner , which will , in my own opinion , constitute my happiness , without reference to you , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me .	3902.411578870276
'Ah !	29757.454875608575
She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved .	6843.551665902812
He has also brotherly pride , which with some brotherly affection , makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister ;	4663.815943491291
but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them ;	4663.724452248703
It was generally evident whenever they met , that he did admire her ;	4970.9921237239405
as we went along , Kitty and me drew up all the blinds , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ;	5761.270727909864
I am talking of possibilities , Charles .	5309.41460608635
because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth .	6982.225423722116
Mama , cried Lydia , my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they first came ;	5347.272004983755
You have said quite enough , madam .	6637.482172402638
Brighton , and a whole campful of soldiers , to us , who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia , and the monthly balls of Meryton .	5283.910422198452
He readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for her distress , wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope , and leaving his compliments for her relations , with only one serious , parting , look , went away .	4159.807232636699
and unwilling for her sister's sake , to provoke him , she only said in reply , with a good-humoured smile , Come , Wickham , we are brother and sister , you know .	4323.588598362338
As he spoke there was a sort of smile , which Elizabeth fancied she understood ;	5859.322575201983
E below .	21632.83805867054
And she rose as she spoke .	8338.295174151375
Well !	20128.261169466754
There is nothing else to be done .	6157.568713296181
His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece ;	6606.985612139751
But she had never felt so strongly as now , the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage , nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents ;	4133.893949324539
I thought too ill of him , to invite him to Pemberley , or admit his society in town .	4803.562592673939
But while he was mortal , there must be a triumph .	6305.235817475031
I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest , there is no occasion for any thing more .	4226.245225070463
It is a great comfort to have you so rich , and when you have nothing else to do , I hope you will think of us .	3881.3781112333927
Do not distress me by the idea .	7652.257991586525
Nothing is more deceitful , said Darcy , than the appearance of humility .	6903.5925195013
Jane was not deceived , but she was affected ;	6823.381037034664
and if you lament over him much longer , my heart will be as light as a feather .	4408.570242596047
It is a pity they are not handsome !	4865.000800115095
what is it about ?	12781.945091778787
But Jane and Elizabeth , who agreed in wishing , for the sake of their sister's feelings and consequence , that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents , urged him so earnestly , yet so rationally and so mildly , to receive her and her husband at Longbourn , as soon as they were married , that he was prevailed on to think as they thought , and act as they wished .	3657.664058778671
Her face is too thin ;	9807.29913675854
Their visits to Philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence .	6927.246443253133
of what are you thinking ?	12805.416551947083
It was in the Times and the Courier , I know ;	5183.6618404326655
and fourthly , that the match might be broken off .	6248.2743661024315
She felt that Jane's feelings , though fervent , were little displayed , and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner , not often united with great sensibility .	4305.862462102307
I must not decide on my own performance .	5774.095686985522
Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible ;	4380.647998526147
but when Philips understood from him what Rosings was , and who was its proprietor , when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms , and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all the force of the compliment , and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper's room .	3885.804858953341
There is nothing the matter with me .	6102.031681756072
And as to laughter , we will not expose ourselves , if you please , by attempting to laugh without a subject .	5010.37873835542
Here again I shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell .	6843.336213545967
Well , Colonel Fitzwilliam , what do I play next ?	6348.663148236392
Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp , and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table , and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley's .	4599.282288119337
He shall be mercenary , and she shall be foolish .	6511.464484035949
They were all of them warm in their admiration ;	6033.305594724204
These recollections will not do at all .	9767.695682389953
secondly , she was very sure that Collins had been taken in ;	8019.576287890098
The garden sloping to the road , the house standing in it , the green pales and the laurel hedge , every thing declared they were arriving .	4695.606993484713
Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption , while the servants remained .	6153.852207953772
Human nature is so prone to fall into it !	9475.89221511754

Never mind Miss Lizzy's hair .	12170.722047920483
Wickham will soon be gone ;	10617.40304560571
but , stopping on his approach , received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome .	4951.95563725931
Oh !	6826.5207498362
Had Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle , she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself ;	5082.351965419979
Collins was also in the same state of angry pride .	6804.155783584658
Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered .	7095.650689534438
The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon , and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her that she was not enough recovered ;	4397.638907245635
and I find that the young man forgot to tell you , among his other communications , that he was the son of old Wickham , the late Darcy's steward .	4158.110044985492
But nothing can be done ;	8717.523290649757
but Elizabeth , to satisfy her mother , went to the window she looked , she saw Darcy with him , and sat down again by her sister .	4310.517194842898
He then sat down by her , and talked scarcely to any one else .	5360.658740967785
Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject .	9048.14935614114
How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day !	5771.6583775853705
and if she might judge from his complexion , his mind was not very differently engaged .	4573.569832978749
I have not been accustomed to such language as this .	4421.4824721267
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection .	6006.6402966238265
It was rather small , but well built and convenient ;	5314.238650825088
but Bennet was firm : it soon led to another ;	6413.654626862632
Next time you call , said she , I hope we shall be more lucky .	6330.310110660701
CHAPTER X Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter , as soon as she possibly could .	5232.7871954038765
This preservative she had now obtained ;	9253.850946527073
Every thing , however , went on smoothly , and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch .	5705.353702225741
I was uncomfortable enough .	7005.996540015052
Gardiner , who was several years younger than Bennet and Philips , was an amiable , intelligent , elegant woman , and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces .	4657.355917907822
Yes ;	11624.632075734577
Undoubtedly .	28083.34266691188
Darcy smiled and said , You are perfectly right .	7348.324023925286
I wish I could call her amiable .	5230.658040852842
He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere , if not with equal regard .	5018.400002557437
but it is wholly out of my power .	5844.228939038615
There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter , which promises well .	5166.167537581788
This idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view ;	6258.929500750947
it must be my uncle's doings !	9009.468386334029
Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother , on her ladyship's entrance , though no request of introduction had been made .	4798.107003015295
He was fond of the country and of books ;	5811.741767212391
and in her postscript it was added , that if Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer , she could spare them very well .	4285.952775218448
How so ?	14891.117005620777
He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment , on account of some debts of honour , which were very pressing ;	5121.7595870513205
They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation ;	6062.226458027718
Bingley was the principal spokesman , and Miss Bennet the principal object .	6247.757454667496
She blushed at the very idea ;	8103.270527315195
He is indeed but considering the inducement , my dear Miss Eliza , we cannot wonder at his complaisance ;	4664.514221424876
When they were all in the drawing-room , the questions which Elizabeth had already asked , were of course repeated by the others , and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give .	4512.33968271842
But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour ;	7176.531119703015
I should imagine not .	7220.387129596277
Darcy , you see , is the man !	6820.266099830989
Probably not ;	22757.11010138367
there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home , how she would like Lady Catherine , and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be ;	4868.375995139527
You may as well call it impertinence at once .	6113.489846341556
Away ran the girls , too eager to get in to have time for speech .	7118.298473943141
The insipidity and yet the noise ;	8198.321871905062
and from this time Bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them .	5421.4015358105835
and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again .	4829.437188570005
and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world , he was caught by their easy playfulness .	4088.380707524397
Darcy , as well as Elizabeth , really loved them ;	6548.6859470702675
It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends .	4673.2664114561185
She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas , who often joined them , and good-naturedly engaged Collins's conversation to herself .	4938.429771957968
In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health , imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better .	5017.485922931607
Jane was distressed .	11177.887996712147
My kind friends will not hear of my returning home till I am better .	6089.572736321945
what news ?	18612.64937059427
for the curiosity excited by his long absence , burst forth in such very direct questions on his return , as required some ingenuity to evade , and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial , for he was longing to publish his prosperous love .	4238.036341567629
She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened ;	5119.791309189152
She will not be able to help calling .	6267.067536799828
His character sunk on every review of it ;	7431.785507115016
said he ;	14473.494565831368
Eliza Bennet , said Miss Bingley , when the door was closed on her , is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex , by undervaluing their own ;	4699.6969798640275
On both sides it was only assertion .	8912.847479189199
though perhaps it was lucky for her husband , who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form , that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly .	4903.344477977032
Their society can afford no pleasure , that will atone for such wretchedness as this !	6278.786951863464
Let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied .	7038.513801865682
no .	21743.916583426515
He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood ;	5549.502781422953
We seem to have been designed for each other .	7219.082149230657
I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your's .	5030.4907744696375
Where is your sister ?	14264.996685155862
I did for you .	7416.280340998224
Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand ;	6414.218981550867
and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months .	6092.032108916079
Easter was approaching , and the week preceding it , was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings , which in so small a circle must be important .	5283.931500044719
There was certainly at this moment , in Elizabeth's mind , a more gentle sensation towards the original , than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance .	4526.403770775649
As he quitted the room , Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire ;	4560.284778895064
indeed , you must have seen it in the papers .	8678.405711953168
I can answer your question , said Fitzwilliam , without applying to him .	5205.332580064581
In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother , though expressed most concisely , he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done , and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him .	4366.894025221504
nor could she for a moment repent her refusal , or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again .	5465.343585355685
And so saying , he turned back with them , and walked towards the house .	5266.150940026909
How can they suit each other ?	8371.4559677309
Oh !	6826.5207498362
Can he be a sensible man , sir ?	8956.787850724779
Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room , to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself .	4852.7047181593025
But , my dear Elizabeth , she added , what sort of girl is Miss King ?	4334.481155762853
But , however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination , I do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage , had it not been seconded by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving , of your sister's indifference .	3984.4718502971746
Do not wish me such an evil .	7652.257991586525
But there was much to be talked of , in marrying her ;	5440.065971578814
He begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother ;	5862.699917407219
At length , quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book , which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his , she gave a great yawn and said , How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way !	4117.4820779084885
To Caroline's assertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit .	6120.515807289354
and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt , than to run such a risk .	5062.118888726836
I rather wished , than believed him to be sincere ;	6011.603003454852
He heard her attentively , and then said , Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances .	4146.376756954572
Elizabeth could bear it no longer .	7114.494634915096
I assure you , that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it .	4692.44015810049
Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual .	10039.065222713376
If they had uncles enough to fill all Cheapside , cried Bingley , it would not make them one jot less agreeable .	5132.057549222288
Both , replied Elizabeth archly ;	12805.416551947083
You have now done your duty by her , and must fret no longer .	5295.740125074223
but if she is really headstrong and foolish , I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state .	4278.063093052424
Elizabeth , equally next to Jane in birth and beauty , succeeded her of course .	5166.4283911303155
and the gown which had been let down to hide it , not doing its office .	4703.97651533394
Let me be rightly understood .	9293.558535215243
Because honour , decorum , prudence , nay , interest , forbid it .	7512.894384124344
and she seized the opportunity of saying , Is your sister at Pemberley still ?	4743.4780207989625
on Tuesday , his wife received a letter from him ;	8406.011737537883
It was acknowledged , however , that he was a liberal man , and did much good among the poor .	4446.953418528186
The first wish of my heart , said she to herself , is never more to be in company with either of them .	4629.404345247365
in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and I dare say it would succeed , if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way .	4899.505181217802
Darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence .	8504.04700085033
she had seen enough of Bingley's behaviour to Jane , to be convinced that she would get him at last ;	5400.314317170028
About the Court , such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon .	7376.871705662011
I have not an instant to lose .	4927.97688998504
Don't think me angry , however , for I only mean to let you know , that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side .	5347.425565150885
Bennet was quite disconcerted .	8879.839294508674
A lively imagination soon settled it all .	8634.085440925764
E7 and any additional terms imposed by the copyright holder .	8523.837776034541
He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem .	5196.272846970698
When my eyes were opened to his real character .	7407.645289253704
Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged , by the scarcity of gentlemen , to sit down for two dances ;	5412.306223697487
How strange this is !	10389.737467547317
what felicity !	18612.64937059427
I should be glad to take a turn in it , if you will favour me with your company .	4433.393455647319
and I was convinced of her affection .	5692.691359724123
Her home and her housekeeping , her parish and her poultry , and all their dependent concerns , had not yet lost their charms .	5089.68610413819
and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls ;	4251.29840956532
They soon outstripped the others , and when they had reached the carriage , and Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind .	5039.087327091367
But if he returns no more this winter , my choice will never be required .	5092.803497283576
Your first position is false .	10517.970518673485
and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him .	4383.002081797476
Five daughters brought up at home without a governess !	8806.929125650904
What does Darcy mean , said she to Charlotte , by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster ?	5640.022024863016
There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men .	6231.500282235553
I will go directly to Bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , I am sure .	4049.01793825144
She smiled , but made no answer .	6825.80999429672
As to his real character , had information been in her power , she had never felt a wish of enquiring .	5262.636501751823
Darcy was delighted with their engagement ;	8253.425422527385
Bingley had danced with her twice , and she had been distinguished by his sisters .	5939.942195086921
But if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal it , he must find it out .	4540.308262033525
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged , every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him .	5478.767591918424
- You provide , in accordance with paragraph 1 .	8185.192366424143
and , as he had likewise foretold , he took his seat at the bottom of the table , by her ladyship's desire , and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater .	3956.7417788447533
A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her , a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude , and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter .	4430.142103113331
Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile , but Elizabeth could not return it .	5812.31849651121
It would have been strange if they had .	6152.326348119377
every thing must sink under such a proof of family weakness , such an assurance of the deepest disgrace .	6120.275956223468
She has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject , to give greater what shall I call it ?	4557.3917500495145
and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance , especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again .	4144.973260609355
When the ladies returned to the drawing-room , there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk , which she did without any intermission till coffee came in , delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted .	4030.354361858803
And her neighbours at Lucas lodge , therefore , ( for through their communication with the Collinses , the report she concluded had reached lady Catherine ) had only set that down , as almost certain and immediate , which she had looked forward to as possible , at some future time .	4171.12407612127
I really cannot laugh at it .	7386.9658524529195
The Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan S Fairbanks , AK , 99712 .	5571.020966440054
the door was thrown open , and she ran into the room .	6021.144974834219
Perhaps this concealment , this disguise , was beneath me .	7733.929680100861
Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion , and complimented her on bearing it so well .	5964.930241097819
But , my dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me obstinate if I still assert , that , considering what her behaviour was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion .	3789.818612751807
Do you suppose them to be in London ?	7099.382546656276
Once or twice she could discern a faint blush ;	9475.89221511754
But , however , that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here , I am determined .	4454.103799581442
But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into , was shortly relieved , and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope , by an article of news , which then began to be in circulation .	4187.248159501044
Can I speak plainer ?	12551.374305129842
Some time or other he will be but it shall not be by me .	6983.388612275768
As they went down stairs together , Charlotte said , I shall depend on hearing from you very often , Eliza .	5154.655576408111
I have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse .	5135.801110818716
By nature inoffensive , friendly and obliging , his presentation at James's had made him courteous .	6269.754105301764
he had looked at her without admiration at the ball ;	6923.162860449211
But , in my opinion , it is a paltry device , a very mean art .	4822.662086026219
His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear .	6606.985612139751
She must own that she was tired of great houses ;	6560.498694651003
But if it be only a slight , thin sort of inclination , I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away .	4431.240405569331
Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us , which becomes herself and daughter .	5011.986236695159
Laugh as much as you chuse , but you will not laugh me out of my opinion .	6377.3244519529835
What do I not owe you !	8140.470552628504
Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies ;	6124.3105388890135
There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire .	6033.724728853695
It is excellent news , capital news , and about a certain person that we all like .	4695.497756377233
you sly thing !	16685.06169320472
On Miss Lucas's persevering , however , she added , Very well ;	6865.7245113920035
I found , said he , as the time drew near , that I had better not meet Darcy ;	4682.4694834800275
She then read the first sentence aloud , which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly , and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street , where Hurst had a house .	4150.279532500563
but his father's uncommon attachment to me , irritated him I believe very early in life .	5079.514551587903
Elizabeth hoped she had silenced him ;	8413.918902505988
You want to tell me , and I have no objection to hearing it .	5791.577336655545
Amongst the most violent against him was Bennet , whose dislike of his general behaviour , was sharpened into particular resentment , by his having slighted one of her daughters .	5125.158197932717
Yes , Ma'am , that he was indeed ;	6285.036703615511
In consequence of an agreement between the sisters , Elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother , to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day .	4306.59113028371
With his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous , contained much good sense and solid reasoning .	4892.823323302616
Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education , and who has lived in the world , is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers ?	5306.222670798014
On Sunday , after morning service , the separation , so agreeable to almost all , took place .	5792.977703128117
As a brother , a landlord , a master , she considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship !	5301.15241580175
You shall have it in few words .	7450.465382594227
I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden , and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter !	4559.755214967912
In such an exigence my uncle's advice and assistance would be every thing in the world ;	5487.0487322032595
So much the better .	10560.519660768812
And tell my dear Lydia , not to give any directions about her clothes , till she has seen me , for she does not know which are the best warehouses .	4672.493800783362
On Saturday he came again .	10191.571006131417
but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way , and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow evening .	4358.259614801527
Yet in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin Elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may incur , by a precipitate closure with this gentleman's proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of .	4471.76254897716
it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Bingley's being there ;	4779.576511323999
There is a gentleman with him , mamma , said Kitty ;	5668.846797618479
The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her .	5094.262473539848
After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event , which Elizabeth considered as all but certain , and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible ;	4848.046877331737
Lydia the humiliation , the misery , she was bringing on them all , soon swallowed up every private care ;	5756.632865641019
Go , my dear , cried her mother , and shew her ladyship about the different walks .	6316.539349795004
Lady Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes , and consideration for his comfort , appeared very remarkable .	5097.318939177426
it remains to be told why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where I assure you there are many amiable young women .	4987.281141680035
and he afterwards took occasion to ask her , when unattended to by any of the rest , whether all her sisters were at Longbourn .	4378.794954318021
But I was embarrassed .	6804.246378439307
A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern .	7099.948067091198
It cannot be done too much ;	7223.631607302386
Elizabeth , with a triumphant sensation , looked towards his friend .	5669.296165243843
Are you out of your senses , to be accepting this man ?	6648.985496275066
Oh !	6826.5207498362
So much the better .	10560.519660768812
Oh !	6826.5207498362
Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint ;	5447.917061686385
But he is a liberal master , I suppose , and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue .	4685.5832381442815
I shall see her in January .	5849.491271312434
and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married .	4829.437188570005
He has a very satirical eye , and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself , I shall soon grow afraid of him .	4576.732212336232
Elizabeth , who knew this to be levelled at Darcy , was in such misery of shame , that she could hardly keep her seat .	4349.9587280410105
how I should like to be married before any of you ;	7244.127810120173
It must be his own doing .	6752.009083454888
Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment , and then replied , The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind .	5027.82759758445
Bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Darcy ;	5141.740170237578
and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress ;	5029.320476831875
They then went away .	10136.517766292152
Their reception at home was most kind .	8748.64542780003
There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again ;	6425.386584021712
Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast , and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before .	5188.3788292418785
I must speak to Hill , this moment .	5943.708047408492
But I know the foundation is unjust .	6014.00414319002
It was absolutely necessary , therefore , to think of something , and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in Hertfordshire , and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure , she observed , How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November , Darcy !	3826.7986337803563
Darcy is not to be laughed at !	8062.941019814756
The party did not supply much conversation .	7277.23179689482
But do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us ?	5243.004131883527
Having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and from her age and disposition , greater steadiness than first attachments often boast ;	4974.968604405618
Pleased with the preference of one , and offended by the neglect of the other , on the very beginning of our acquaintance , I have courted prepossession and ignorance , and driven reason away , where either were concerned .	4783.479042764543
When alone with Elizabeth afterwards , she spoke more on the subject .	6231.536119109492
Never , since reading Jane's second letter , had she entertained a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her .	5778.977568287282
gave her hand with an affectionate smile to Wickham , who followed his lady , and wished them both joy , with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness .	5167.78311679803
and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ;	4310.51899673586
We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect .	5593.923182310545
and , therefore , I am not afraid of speaking openly .	4553.751002517752
He then shut the door , and coming up to her , claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister .	4865.630719129158
and it might strike them that they could be more economically , though less expeditiously , married in London , than in Scotland .	4484.915424171453
Is it not clear enough ?	10882.440997670728
and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes ;	4454.515167499197
His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case , but his reliance on mine , made every thing easy .	4992.001307004059
She looked at his two sisters , and saw them making signs of derision at each other , and at Darcy , who continued however impenetrably grave .	4398.998722132531
and , after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table , they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper , who attended , in the absence of her daughters .	3891.9775601969727
He was very fond of them .	6606.120385764249
And you may be certain that when I have the honour of seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualifications .	4409.341581659332
She was not rendered formidable by silence ;	5553.794381231754
It was , on the contrary , exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes ;	4422.7018745585465
Do you really think so ?	8945.695877751301
I owe all that I know of it , to another , not to you .	5455.496304542504
CHAPTER XV .	11746.06741553873
A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little .	8634.085440925764
but she was flattered and pleased .	6056.186121150114
She attracted him more than he liked and Miss Bingley was uncivil to her , and more teazing than usual to himself .	5000.550228874079
And what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her ?	5486.319339183151
Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness , openness , ductility of his temper , though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own , and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied .	4447.132825577113
In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable , and Jane to make her resigned .	5615.798461205245
But perhaps Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle .	4312.443262873689
Very true , indeed ;	11711.182645927258
Her performance was pleasing , though by no means capital .	6918.21922366394
What are we to do !	9365.436712545801
I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner .	5598.904334952052
and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark .	4861.309023213522
and when Wickham walked into the room , Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before , nor thinking of him since , with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration .	4098.3659901085
Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy , drawn when she was only eight years old .	6120.275956223468
Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail .	6309.04991985441
what it contains , has surprised me a good deal .	8049.840916671803
it will then be early enough for expectation .	8334.128836362986
I will try again .	7069.819631340672
He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire .	6219.397240984031
If I wished to think slightingly of any body's children , it should not be of my own however .	5055.617342841569
There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings !	6140.188075195013
His choice is disinterested at least , for he must know my father can give her nothing .	5748.00404479106
This is an evening of wonders , indeed !	7004.238056366479
1 .	12212.55279990698
If he had been wavering before , as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy , as dignity unblemished could make him .	4016.4762584783475
it was not their wish to force her communication .	6636.650003162033
You wish to think all the world respectable , and are hurt if I speak ill of any body .	5316.42205730112
F2 .	29757.454875608575
He was received by Bennet with a degree of civility , which made her two daughters ashamed , especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend .	4199.39262979069
That is the place to get husbands .	6896.553594865278
Sir , you quite misunderstand me , said Bennet , alarmed .	7581.722785198027
engaged to Darcy !	18472.368653312184
How far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs , I cannot tell ;	5798.036795489125
and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown .	5976.440283860336
only think !	20869.11113949553
But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley .	4721.123081809126
and then you may say whatever you like of me .	5371.772190596391
Gardiner was standing a little behind ;	9223.21470484935
His behaviour to her sister was such , during dinner time , as shewed an admiration of her , which , though more guarded than formerly , persuaded Elizabeth , that if left wholly to himself , Jane's happiness , and his own , would be speedily secured .	4166.609244742165
He paused in hopes of an answer ;	7761.9054287946265
but I hope this may be false .	6029.738833387564
But I think Darcy improves on acquaintance .	6014.00414319002
Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , reflecting on what she had heard , and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it , when Sir William Lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family .	4000.6954773743555
It is a rule with me , that a person who can write a long letter , with ease , cannot write ill .	4149.436877707448
I know little of the game , at present , said he , but I shall be glad to improve myself , for in my situation of life Philips was very thankful for his compliance , but could not wait for his reason .	3994.048782724429
For such an attachment as this , she might have sufficient charms ;	7077.814995162629
On the strength of Darcy's regard Bingley had the firmest reliance , and of his judgment the highest opinion .	5302.36181777641
With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Bingley and talked of Darcy may be guessed .	6239.159073654447
He walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind ;	5118.244202567239
I am not going to run away , Papa , said Kitty , fretfully ;	4141.770177143175
Her not objecting , does not justify him .	7855.38266215457
I am sorry to pain you but so it was .	4217.231335610336
Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in undiminished beauty ;	8037.238223422664
for Lady Catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men .	4261.061748802625
She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place , and accordingly began by observing , that his arrival had been very unexpected for your housekeeper , she added , informed us that you would certainly not be here till to-morrow ;	4109.1523303559
Oh !	6826.5207498362
there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded , and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time .	5483.1701724413815
He looked surprised , displeased , alarmed ;	7523.634045102209
In a moment they were all out of the chaise , rejoicing at the sight of each other .	5093.839912648386
I wish this may be more intelligible , but though not confined for time , my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent .	4388.731809159141
and on the part of Bennet and Kitty , though she was perfectly unknown to them , even inferior to what Elizabeth felt .	4484.8711624679445
Eager to be alone , and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt , she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley , and then hurried away to dress .	4777.42436299699
His countenance , voice , and manner , had established him at once in the possession of every virtue .	5433.2020533712475
He assured her that as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ;	5862.699917407219
Already arisen !	22757.11010138367
an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope , that by the following Christmas , she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day , unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war-office , another regiment should be quartered in Meryton .	4490.786703968174
Ah !	22111.518280636905
On the evening before my going to London , said he I made a confession to him , which I believe I ought to have made long ago .	4687.43213523014
As they passed into other rooms , these objects were taking different positions ;	5952.458042332481
The path just admitted three .	8862.155784659559
her's lasted a little longer ;	13637.93872720995
Do not let us quarrel about the past .	7233.681365642409
He was a tall , heavy looking young man of five and twenty .	5217.45947238102
Elizabeth was not comfortable ;	7264.338236287298
But I dare not hope it .	6294.36655341362
The strangeness of Collins's making two offers of marriage within three days , was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted .	4882.141947188378
and if you are not kind to us , brother , I do not know what we shall do .	4180.001789130611
Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports , by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under .	4820.885070282588
but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship , I suspect his gratitude misleads him , and that in spite of her being his patroness , she is an arrogant , conceited woman .	4393.938031026934
But it is of small importance .	6231.253800170434
Your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct , I am sure .	5572.892047109061
I [ Illustration : A VICARAGE HOUSE .	7192.436393339187

Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself ;	5062.131223929864
I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one .	4217.231335610336
By all that I have ever read , I am convinced that it is very common indeed , that human nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other , real or imaginary .	4101.751020678525
At night she opened her heart to Jane .	8334.04334891202
That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Bingley and Jane , she had never doubted ;	5181.520347174823
Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner ;	7239.1785071855
I roused , and interested you , because I was so unlike them .	5719.627236165202
Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty .	4842.495323010649
and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared with his friend .	4379.3136021518285
Put them next to your great uncle the judge .	9475.89221511754
She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done , and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct .	4739.095418809116
And which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty ?	6000.043008055739
My dear Lizzy , you cannot think me so weak , as to be in danger now .	4661.962924193106
She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself , in their first evening at Philips's .	5067.954207719057
I wish it may .	7475.880620450345
She approached , and saw the likeness of Wickham suspended , amongst several other miniatures , over the mantle-piece .	5222.46442170875
but on beholding it , ( for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library , ) he started back , and begging pardon , protested that he never read novels .	4440.394300287889
When she thought of her mother indeed , her confidence gave way a little , but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with Darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend's connections , than from their want of sense ;	4100.883196513382
The very last evening was spent there ;	7277.23179689482
and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to .	4278.781849067182
CHAPTER XX .	15231.67119605404
Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand .	7861.744818784409
The children have been wanting me this half hour .	6723.539992625978
To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed , she soon afterwards said , I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal .	4425.70911223555
DEAR SIR , I must trouble you once more for congratulations .	7841.526210015776
After breakfast , the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Wickham were returned , and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball .	5168.888170742591
By Hurst and Miss Bingley , they were noticed only by a curtsey ;	6735.116518982393
and she was quite decided at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining Bingley for his sister .	3917.5504816699195
She could have added , A young man too , like you , whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable but she contented herself with And one , too , who had probably been his own companion from childhood , connected together , as I think you said , in the closest manner !	3982.011355434957
the ladies had crowded round the table , where Miss Bennet was making tea , and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee , in so close a confederacy , that there was not a single vacancy near her , which would admit of a chair .	4441.36667975075
She is a most charming young lady indeed .	5295.942925846254
This matter may be considered , therefore , as finally settled .	6941.495694965286
Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go , merely on that account , for in general you know they visit no new comers .	4855.101496272656
I never saw any one so shocked .	5841.023779699866
and if I were determined to get a rich husband , or any husband , I dare say I should adopt it .	4314.069082779378
I cannot find out that I hate her at all , or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl .	4231.427951102398
but Collins , much offended , laid aside his book , and said , I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp , though written solely for their benefit .	4329.274859979354
but her letters were always long expected , and always very short .	5825.127522254776
but their progress was slow , for Gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little .	4060.953162308552
has thrown herself into the power of of Wickham .	9223.268522220616
To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever .	6989.4044286989565
Elizabeth had settled it that Darcy would bring his sister to visit her , the very day after her reaching Pemberley ;	4855.370666915097
He is also handsome , replied Elizabeth , which a young man ought likewise to be , if he possibly can .	4703.702480190097
and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects , which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world .	4995.256664414633
and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford , they reached Gardiner's house , where they were to remain a few days .	4793.151247357832
whether he had been aware of Jane's attachment , or whether it had escaped his observation ;	6890.608367827997
I suspected as much , replied Elizabeth .	6819.137862088858
and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there , to know the rest .	4703.240949877737
He has made me so happy , said she , one evening , by telling me , that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring !	4334.904287029503
Collins was gratified ;	11458.128445897706
She has one only daughter , the heiress of Rosings , and of very extensive property .	5182.520228290975
Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips .	6040.596889601698
and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter .	5855.157342596739
Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon .	7289.28779844046
Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty ;	6888.036862119423
but , however , do not speak to Darcy about it , if you had rather not .	4662.474750648331
Gardiner , whose manners were easy and pleasant , encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks ;	5686.8859999876195
She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire ;	4571.341418809679
When they parted , Lady Catherine , with great condescension , wished them a good journey , and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year ;	4746.454753488459
said he , as he joined her .	7798.0124411892175
I wonder that the very pride of this Darcy has not made him just to you !	5019.011429033789
E1 through 1 .	13655.09841630426
for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing .	5532.432289448517
I will not trust myself on the subject , replied Wickham , I can hardly be just to him .	4455.9006657619875
Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendance , and when immediately before my father's death , Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me , I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him , as of affection to myself .	4114.738508143312
and Elizabeth sorry for her , and sorry for her father's speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no good .	4498.307425520445
CHAPTER XII .	13083.650239159624
Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham ;	5633.8073683003395
It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family .	4715.7428425732105
Occupied in observing Bingley's attentions to her sister , Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend .	5151.32415112597
but his friend Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine , tall person , handsome features , noble mien ;	4636.844488792004
To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit <URL> While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements , we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate .	4227.845698342978
Hurst sang with her sister , and while they were thus employed Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument , how frequently Darcy's eyes were fixed on her .	4733.571230109403
Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him , I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds , or any thing like it , has been advanced .	5125.44891782486
After welcoming their sisters , they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords , exclaiming , Is not this nice ?	4940.628450642173
To these high flown expressions , Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ;	6295.628679700398
the satisfaction of Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face , as made her look handsomer than ever .	5295.199591434726
come into my room .	15633.167043926136
It is difficult indeed it is distressing .	5910.328749119172
And so , you like this man's sisters too , do you ?	5393.641655463098
and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern , when Kitty left them , she went boldly on with him alone .	4329.6197885828715
Collins on his return highly gratified Bennet by admiring Philips's manners and politeness .	6584.053039243611
I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine , that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess , and that the most elevated rank , instead of giving her consequence , would be adorned by her .	3997.6993015477706
So imprudent a match on both sides !	9936.584974667936
If I can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too .	4906.565280856027
But , Lizzy !	7478.529722994466
Seriously , I would have you be on your guard .	8249.665468846553
And do you impute it to either of those ?	6462.092015665177
but as she reached the door , it was opened by a servant , and Darcy appeared .	5014.064456077746
She complained bitterly of all this to her husband .	6843.551665902812
You are very cruel , said her sister , you will not let me smile , and are provoking me to it every moment .	4439.389701496814
I have already told her so once , by your desire .	5019.683401589768
Though I know it must be a scandalous falsehood ;	8365.10875384705
Not at all .	10198.244854769435
all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return .	7354.488126083833
My dear Charles , what do you mean ?	6101.171995375949
Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained ;	5427.545694752043
Heaven and earth !	17103.64478316344

The Miss Webbs all play , and their father has not so good an income as your's .	5442.917329673097
for while he was present , Jane had no attention to bestow on any one else ;	5876.527516542408
Come , Kitty , I want you up stairs .	8572.221743863465
I must confess myself surprised by your application ;	5943.708047408492
On opening the door , she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth , as if engaged in earnest conversation ;	5306.147945910116
He was the proudest , most disagreeable man in the world , and every body hoped that he would never come there again .	4397.338255806703
I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be .	4683.1898958969
I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours , he coldly replied .	5148.302932516597
Yes , indeed ;	9127.274403465812
Astonishment , apprehension , and even horror , oppressed her .	8901.060544562486
and her Ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey , gave them directions as to the best method of packing , and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way , that Maria thought herself obliged , on her return , to undo all the work of the morning , and pack her trunk afresh .	3870.500087929536
As for Wickham and Lydia , their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters .	5391.018470197764
I quite detest the man .	7909.810216643001
She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Darcy that Darcy might leave the country , but that he should stand his ground ;	4467.46757551929
You have a house in town , I conclude ?	5815.43552362456
Of the lady's sensations they remained a little in doubt ;	7882.606845492171
My avowed one , or what I avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which I have since made .	4463.65628470913
She saw with the creative eye of fancy , the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers .	4917.727327135668
The distance is nothing , when one has a motive ;	6618.13045543331
To know that her daughter would be married was enough .	6939.907310747881
And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing , that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood , before she was banished to the North .	4658.171572177727
You mentioned two instances .	10032.265768172017
I take up my pen again to do , what I have just told you I would not , but circumstances are such , that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here , as soon as possible .	4199.440457581444
No I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did .	6189.931886562004
Darcy said very little , and Hurst nothing at all .	6547.805137069262
and already had Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping , when an answer arrived which deferred it all .	4692.066417744429
It could not be for society , as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips ;	5270.6907928816245
All this she must possess , added Darcy , and to all this she must yet add something more substantial , in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading .	4940.634563154172
It is settled between us already , that we are to be the happiest couple in the world .	4401.640699033654
But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede .	5390.2805340854775
You mistake me , my dear .	8131.025082710581
And will you promise me , never to enter into such an engagement ?	6174.415268533252
The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases , and again during the chief of the day , was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Collins .	4563.037886207957
You began the evening well , Charlotte , said Bennet with civil self-command to Miss Lucas .	5632.35891468135
Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in July , and must be in London again within a month ;	5191.105180591141
Hurst thought the same , and added , She has nothing , in short , to recommend her , but being an excellent walker .	5463.140455235305
and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks .	4839.920854233113
but she was satisfied with none .	6056.258596944961
Indeed , you are mistaken , I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here .	5185.022628851679
I thought we never should have got into the coach .	5756.88566302132
She wished , she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them ;	5458.762836128308
Oh !	6826.5207498362
for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to Darcy were by no means over .	5518.750290731584
and I know I appeared distressed .	5930.804042439338
But you do not know all .	7062.659684857892
He absolutely started , and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise ;	6212.251772221005
It does seem , and it is most shocking indeed , replied Elizabeth , with tears in her eyes , that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt .	4217.515826013443
She went on .	10738.86338622509
Nay , cried Bingley , this is too much , to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning .	5484.500267535854
How thankful am I , that we never let them know what has been said against him ;	5771.6583775853705
She had also to anticipate how her visit would pass , the quiet tenor of their usual employments , the vexatious interruptions of Collins , and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings .	4162.151496047344
During their walk , it was resolved that Bennet's consent should be asked in the course of the evening .	5565.176361928987
She says Lizzy had better have taken Collins ;	7182.02509468392
This information made Elizabeth smile , as she thought of poor Miss Bingley .	6318.961342713331
but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown , before they are packed up .	4516.1103487001765
No sooner did he appear , than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed ;	5983.0012542998165
I can safely say , that every advance to intimacy began on her side .	5101.657046057614
It was really a very handsome thought .	5859.054157689969
perhaps that was the reason of his silence ;	9887.980455828847
You know him too well to doubt the rest .	6293.149348973521
That is an uncommon advantage , and uncommon I hope it will continue , for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance .	4521.505363136962
but where other powers of entertainment are wanting , the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given .	5150.179722989437
Miss Bennet's lovely face confirmed his views , and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority ;	5351.11748658389
But no such recollection befriended her .	7547.982374869202
In this danger Kitty is also comprehended .	7648.296961325066
and then rising up , said to Elizabeth , Miss Bennet , there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn .	4294.613956304504
Is not general incivility the very essence of love ?	7877.926359733223
nonsense , how can you talk so !	11054.519526885286
We have dined nine times at Rosings , besides drinking tea there twice !	5970.0017003518715
cried he , with more feeling than politeness ;	7302.183984915864
His behaviour to myself has been scandalous ;	7342.17645975836
and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire-place , that she might be farther from the door .	4279.930211442068
but his companion was not disposed to make any ;	6058.729823759501
and , at last , on the young lady's whispering to Elizabeth again , he walked away .	4612.913245858094
Allowing the case , however , to stand according to your representation , you must remember , Miss Bennet , that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house , and the delay of his plan , has merely desired it , asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety .	4327.26170863788
I feel as if I had never done you justice , or loved you as you deserve .	5246.52616116342
Their fortune on both sides is splendid .	9025.712578995852
I remain , dear sir , with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters , your well-wisher and friend , WILLIAM COLLINS .	4876.040445511028
She then ran gaily off , rejoicing as she rambled about , in the hope of being at home again in a day or two .	4510.814667060657
In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ?	6508.674864398023
susceptibility to her feelings ;	15633.167043926136
Not all that Bennet , however , with the assistance of her five daughters , could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Bingley .	4814.10187858839
It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it .	4387.749845994483
I have not been used to submit to any person's whims .	4359.753516390349
Oh !	6826.5207498362
And what sort of table do they keep ?	6291.856273400659
but this was declined , and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness .	5207.264074997581
It will pass away soon enough .	7359.301794480219
There is nothing like dancing after all .	6494.651113334699
The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to Wickham's charge , exceedingly shocked her ;	5342.5461318830685
and all was soon right again .	6840.874618943649
but I dare say he may spend half his time here ;	5173.994913770386
therefore , stay quietly at Longbourn , and depend on my diligence and care .	7377.668835743726
so tall !	18193.912977931544
In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity ;	6387.549152338362
or allow her to hear it from any one but myself .	7194.050200755989
and when at length they turned in at the lodge , her spirits were in a high flutter .	4431.970587261299
First of all , he asked Miss Lucas .	9887.980455828847
She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height , or rather taller .	5303.4641328721655
Elizabeth soon heard from her friend ;	7795.648411598169
None at all .	18472.368653312184
Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again .	7512.894384124344
They must all go to Brighton .	8006.811710082388
he had felt their importance in the family circle .	7247.8148637879185
It may perhaps be pleasant , replied Charlotte , to be able to impose on the public in such a case ;	4981.937101257352
and in the latter object , where she feared most to fail , she was most sure of success , for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour .	4040.82564152561
The moment of her release from him was ecstacy .	6907.696563388866
Nay , said Elizabeth , this is not fair .	8641.449780462013
They left Brighton together on Sunday night , and were traced almost to London , but not beyond ;	5526.946546254693
I have not a doubt of your doing very well together .	4541.073999304786
What do you mean , Hill ?	6692.555345083078
and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away .	4115.0563935778455
Nothing of the past was recollected with pain ;	8815.248881559579
it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life .	5688.827528893968
She had dressed with more than usual care , and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart , trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening .	3783.5763634890845
and besides , it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body , and had so many favourites .	4496.24726405189
Unfortunately an only son , ( for many years an only child ) I was spoilt by my parents , who though good themselves , ( my father particularly , all that was benevolent and amiable , ) allowed , encouraged , almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing , to care for none beyond my own family circle , to think meanly of all the rest of the world , to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own .	4084.7789577372787
You are not going to be Missish , I hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report .	4467.137279539799
Aye that is because you have the right disposition .	8807.01338069469
she longed to hear more , and was grateful to her uncle for saying , There are very few people of whom so much can be said .	5024.513539396694
Whatever I do is done in a hurry , replied he ;	7824.8349782146615
No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there .	6747.948871829573
When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose , or procuring any thing you had a fancy for ?	5147.410921702883
And what did she say ?	7959.3634354973165
I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long .	4155.5245778968565
Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact ;	5283.5265471434095
Indeed I have , Sir , was her answer .	7761.748452640901
I was afraid they might not ;	6235.232689536255
Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure , but as his brother was eager in it , he meant to assist him in pursuing it .	5011.3771392945555
But her commendation , though costing her some trouble , could by no means satisfy Collins , and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship's praise into his own hands .	4459.158478795459
it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister's being in town .	4968.160009390338
but the grounds are delightful .	7465.047027096521
There are few people in England , I suppose , who have more true enjoyment of music than myself , or a better natural taste .	4766.071241674316
cried Maria , after a few minutes silence , it seems but a day or two since we first came !	5519.066163558018
I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression .	4938.762694649575
Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great Lady's attention , which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others .	4957.492149142017
Sometimes she could fancy , that he talked less than on former occasions , and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her , he was trying to trace a resemblance .	4858.079960405613
As much as I ever wish to be , cried Elizabeth warmly , I have spent four days in the same house with him , and I think him very disagreeable .	4743.333018539322
Far be it from me , he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure , to resent the behaviour of your daughter .	5590.621305896214
Nothing could be more delightful !	10663.906528859889
But if otherwise , if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been exchanged , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method , in her partiality for Wickham , and that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment .	3806.659011998912
My poor mother is really ill and keeps her room .	6827.946698170349
But of this answer Lydia heard not a word .	6420.60268833385
What a delightful library you have at Pemberley , Darcy !	6534.8495597193
Oh , sister !	9629.754343160064
Of music !	17847.33324159136
His attachment to Rosings , certainly increases .	8453.130565045667
It was very little less .	6440.647533705799
She would not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried home ;	5454.028494773
And Lydia used to want to go to London , added Kitty .	6232.184614322063
I have a high respect for your nerves .	5274.180168093996
he certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible ;	6680.945180977901
it seems but a fortnight I declare ;	8912.94593649374
and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body .	4389.118015213783
He then handed her in , Maria followed , and the door was on the point of being closed , when he suddenly reminded them , with some consternation , that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings .	4062.5575554000375
and as to Miss Bennet , he could not conceive an angel more beautiful .	4662.7721814725855
As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Bingley , and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to , made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane .	4338.474672640224
and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence .	4542.808613073096
Its effect was most extraordinary ;	12342.318502566179
it was to remain the whole winter , and Meryton was the head quarters .	5763.744630232467
How strange !	13655.704718088826
CHAPTER IX .	11746.06741553873
Her hair so untidy , so blowsy !	8362.806228377349
Good bye .	15987.831621001465
And what is your success ?	7671.419093358034
His character was to speak for itself .	7636.256600631693
they were brightened by the exercise .	10483.926618604204
In the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more ;	5888.299216908369
Why should he have it more than anybody else ?	7788.409699064597

We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes , on purpose to pass for a lady , only think what fun !	5470.507438959417
Has he , has my nephew , made you an offer of marriage ?	6794.94542890637
cried Bennet , shaking her head , then she is better off than many girls .	6041.031366821886
Had his character been known , this could not have happened .	6939.9218267904835
At that moment , she cared for no other .	7199.9753516475275
where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making , and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself , some shelves in the closets up stairs .	5209.162516072102
Her Ladyship , with great condescension , arose to receive them ;	6644.334693247041
I am sure Lizzy will be very happy I am sure she can have no objection .	4053.9529010218553
for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds .	5743.956932413746
Amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment ;	6072.280087146251
but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general , since Jane united with great strength of feeling , a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner , which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent .	3978.3227114062083
how ardently did she long to know , whether any of his were directed in a like manner .	6021.570053155207

but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine .	4767.723080773251
And do you really know all this ?	6889.006069288052
If from no better motive , that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest , for dishonesty I must call it .	5069.045838826352
And yet , upon my honour , I believed what I said of myself to be true , and I believe it at this moment .	4818.635722105295
I did not think Gardiner was so little to be trusted .	4606.652476378066
His brother-in-law , Hurst , merely looked the gentleman ;	7510.187043349958
It was hardly enough ;	6849.294598230442
and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did not err .	4444.907700055708
It was spoken of again while they were at dinner , when Collins joining in , observed , Yes , Miss Elizabeth , you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church , and I need not say you will be delighted with her .	3885.246351176296
if one could but go to Brighton !	8668.115002813247
It was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ;	4175.460126374122
Their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like man he is a great friend of Darcy's .	6466.677674134258
After sitting for a moment in silence , she said very stiffly to Elizabeth , I hope you are well , Miss Bennet .	5004.825593887285
But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Gardiner's letter , or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him .	4291.910274811707
You cannot refuse to dance , I am sure , when so much beauty is before you .	4922.837098173635
Well , how pleased I am !	7756.200889689352
But don't imagine it was from any silly cause .	6824.777555776071
I hope not so .	7069.212024108315
Your plan is a good one , replied Elizabeth , where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married ;	5375.467309446822
I often tell young ladies , that no excellence in music is to be acquired , without constant practice .	5077.189898342106
are sufficiently known .	17658.907085145383
She saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow ;	4739.071113075781
To Elizabeth , however , he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed .	5608.3302478046635
In that case he would return no more .	7442.513230144693
She dared not even mention that gentleman .	7134.382002330749
But , on second thoughts , perhaps Lizzy could tell us , what relations he has now living , better than any other person .	4481.377430015827
No one but Jane , she thought , could flatter herself with such an expectation .	5940.021526481794
The girls stared at their father .	8198.321871905062
The person of whom I speak , is a gentleman and a stranger .	5853.642601770725
Whatever my connections may be , said Elizabeth , if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to you .	5435.58254395637
He smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said .	5389.140040954226
CHAPTER XIV .	11746.06741553873
My mother would have had no objection , but my father hates London .	5919.272404249191
[ Illustration : MATLOCK ] PRIDE AND PREJUDICE : A Novel .	6504.906358285982
Kitty then owned , with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us , that in Lydia's last letter , she had prepared her for such a step .	4931.260192098478
Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could ;	6718.51585063801
Little more than half a day's journey .	11054.2753346869
and so it does I vow .	6765.254860124582
and therefore it will not signify to anybody here , what he really is .	5261.636959211327
and by that means , as I told Lady Catherine myself one day , has deprived the British court of its brightest ornament .	4693.802440610352
Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane , on their first arrival at Lambton ;	4711.8357445054635
You may imagine what I felt and how I acted .	5902.099415306397
It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner .	4648.892329374005
He deserves to be publicly disgraced .	8298.224421540943
Of having another daughter married to Collins , she thought with equal certainty , and with considerable , though not equal , pleasure .	5464.838843823608
and it was settled , that as soon as the ceremony was over , they should proceed to Longbourn .	4327.1565607340535
Bennet was quite in the fidgets .	7596.822659157178
The first part of Gardiner's business on her arrival , was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions .	4955.624130588112

Bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say , but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , I shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as I did before .	4541.208159094492
It seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence , a most country town indifference to decorum .	5050.882812454355
The idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ;	4578.231583865104
I know my dear uncle and aunt so well , that I am not afraid of requesting it , though I have still something more to ask of the former .	4025.3241075737515
would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe .	9475.89221511754
They look upon it quite as their own , I dare say , whenever that happens .	5445.620882911235
The subject was pursued no farther , and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away .	5622.15108170606
Reynolds informed them , that it had been taken in his father's life time .	7047.340801827174
Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets , of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won , and Collins , in describing the civility of and Philips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist , enumerating all the dishes at supper , and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House .	4075.576404174866
His principal object must be , to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham .	5522.039469811436
But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter , depended on the will of the parents .	4932.813750944291
or that may comfort you , under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parent's mind .	5665.9350772254575
But I am particularly attached to these young men ;	5196.600018655885
He inquired how far Netherfield was from Meryton ;	7329.878558530547
Her father lifted up his eyes .	8209.716942367902
That you were gone into the army , and she was afraid had not turned out well .	5697.018094006968
Having said thus much , I feel no doubt of your secrecy .	7544.867432769647
Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look ;	7824.8349782146615
that , that is the worst of all .	8577.976943694173
and that friendship between a person capable of it , and such an amiable man as Bingley , was incomprehensible .	4673.272389072037
and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley , in spite of that pollution which its woods had received , not merely from the presence of such a mistress , but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city .	3903.792799673127
Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished .	7609.590889560021
and very lively hopes of Bingley's heart were entertained .	6496.702865785345
He takes them now for people of fashion .	7329.878558530547
She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry ;	5141.6447106657415
how can you be so teazing ?	10069.066498315633
and be ready to believe , for every body's sake , that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin .	4807.295849949799
in every view it is unaccountable !	10844.088338588286
Jane looked a little paler than usual , but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected .	5931.953800749939
said he , taking the letter from his pocket ;	7002.932476153489
La !	22111.518280636905
he hardly ever mentioned your name .	9771.421732755569
Nay , were your friend Lady Catherine to know me , I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation .	5330.934476637654
Wickham did not play at whist , and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia .	5473.904201963437
I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made her here ;	4946.980454172546
Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for common use ;	5633.8073683003395
I am not a great reader , and I have pleasure in many things .	4141.859382718104
I cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen , in the whole range of my acquaintance , that are really accomplished .	4437.782914776567

Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was .	7620.408611664521
A long dispute followed this declaration ;	9312.947839979217
Undoubtedly , replied Darcy , to whom this remark was chiefly addressed , there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation .	5351.0844811571405
My affections and wishes are unchanged , but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever .	5352.434237592553
What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ?	5999.8226964475725
There was novelty in the scheme , and as , with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters , home could not be faultless , a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake .	4383.786649607427
She then spoke of the letter , repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham .	4815.601603751469
They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them .	5215.846224593412
They had often attempted it before , but it was a subject on which Bennet was beyond the reach of reason ;	4929.485361205034
It is nothing in comparison of Rosings , my lady , I dare say ;	4812.843756200235

Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters , would be unpardonable in me .	8019.4483268181275
One morning , soon after their arrival , as she was sitting with her two elder sisters , she said to Elizabeth , Lizzy , I never gave you an account of my wedding , I believe .	4552.11430934761
This is your final resolve !	8475.384267164394
I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good .	5559.312473742363
It will not do .	8547.727250455197
You either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other's confidence and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking ;	4428.226006071402
I quite forgot !	9492.18051552772
Charlotte herself was tolerably composed .	12024.028991652165
Elizabeth was surprised , but agreed to it immediately .	5533.300358538215
and hastily seizing a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt , if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended .	4327.928042512938
Colonel Forster will , I dare say , do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head .	5228.470851342565
You are safe from me .	7194.458785218755
Here , Sarah , come to Miss Bennet this moment , and help her on with her gown .	6011.964774514358
but from every window there were beauties to be seen .	6253.220801004585
This Younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with Wickham ;	6941.495694965286
You have insulted me , in every possible method .	6090.296530836168
from thence to the library ;	13637.93872720995
to be only just tolerable .	11896.123119353897
But papa is so disagreeable .	8717.40948337674
Why must she be scampering about the country , because her sister had a cold ?	6273.155153171139
I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday .	4886.179423112478
Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley .	5754.557660232842
The vicious propensities the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which Darcy could not have .	4104.268174084539
Jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention .	5893.450108170389
Darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish , and who probably never looked at you in his life !	4810.740247221889
The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield .	6452.581786107462
Oh !	6826.5207498362
talents which rightly used , might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters , even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife .	5496.714426470126
She turned from sister to sister , demanding their congratulations , and when at length they all sat down , looked eagerly round the room , took notice of some little alteration in it , and observed , with a laugh , that it was a great while since she had been there .	4022.22497006849
Wickham's happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer , and Collins's proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could .	5357.480625896639
A great deal of good management , depend upon it .	6705.071433800855
You have done all this !	7463.723524288507
The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life , and where they were now to spend a few days , was probably as great an object of her curiosity , as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock , Chatsworth , Dovedale , or the Peak .	4196.8482237709395
but depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our surest way of disappointing him , will be to ask nothing about it .	4478.257896457913
It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment , from which she had been so wholly free at first .	3763.3190893373817
Gardiner had seen Pemberley , and known the late Darcy by character perfectly well .	6336.942549879765
What could be the meaning of it ?	7556.987029582733
But to be candid without ostentation or design to take the good of every body's character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad belongs to you alone .	4332.004348961194
and her residence there will probably be of some duration .	5533.3507781654125
But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice .	6100.538194433896
They are generally long ;	8825.491013108038
Exceed their income !	18472.368653312184
Find such a woman as soon as you can , bring her to Hunsford , and I will visit her .	5947.257037826355
Elizabeth jumped out ;	11291.257087305366
But these are not Jane's feelings ;	7622.432493940244
Elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her .	5530.998173809741
You think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly .	7858.324534396429
But you have chosen your fault well .	6688.559099953692
All loveliness and goodness as she is !	9468.269087018452
and , to my certain knowledge , more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner .	4396.443748024398
His air was grave and stately , and his manners were very formal .	6387.965955888589
As they drove to Gardiner's door , Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival ;	5635.526314386922
Oh !	6826.5207498362
But , she continued , recollecting herself , as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him .	4520.762994195603
My mother is tolerably well , I trust ;	7154.683775062701
At such a time , much might have been said , and silence was very awkward .	5772.036778200058
and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend , met her with every appearance of composure .	5138.119887257537
as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education , and who still resides with them .	6265.843300715518
But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend , where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment , should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire , without waiting to be argued into it ?	4067.4532581761573
and every dish was commended , first by him , and then by Sir William , who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said , in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear .	4152.4018617099255
he had lost every point ;	9462.452371126239
The housekeeper came forward , and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman , the son of her late master's steward , who had been brought up by him at his own expence .	4290.44603172442
She accounted for it , however , by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn , had by some accident been lost .	4828.318324802861
Sometimes .	26953.136861511783
for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all .	5252.961368503359
Their reception from Bennet , to whom they then turned , was not quite so cordial .	6001.209244354402
Why , I must confess , that I love him better than I do Bingley .	6025.251786734677
Aye , there she comes , continued Bennet , looking as unconcerned as may be , and caring no more for us than if we were at York , provided she can have her own way .	4679.203692022873
it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate .	5918.72007655104
He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names .	5628.563430979856
Elizabeth saw what he was doing , and at the first convenient pause , turned to him with an arch smile , and said , You mean to frighten me , Darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me ?	4268.292095964256
And when the party entered the assembly room , it consisted of only five altogether ;	5548.679127210782
It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy .	5466.206454909799
Yes but as it happens , they are all of them very clever .	6495.009248978902
When Collins could be forgotten , there was really a great air of comfort throughout , and by Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it , Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten .	4780.356325534259
Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ;	7482.475730880159
perhaps she meant well , but , under such a misfortune as this , one cannot see too little of one's neighbours .	5867.282501888594
It is evident that you belong to the first circles .	5351.99446941972
This was one point , with regard to Lydia at least , which was now to be settled , and Bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him .	4532.817992564245
and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room .	5446.82373449358
She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter , and , without knowing or considering what their income might be , rejected many as deficient in size and importance .	4128.388792032887
CHAPTER VI .	11746.06741553873
but I verily believe I could forgive him any thing and every thing , rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father .	4375.904145813766
Oh !	6826.5207498362
Her astonishment at his coming at his coming to Netherfield , to Longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire .	4491.674156146276
The promised letter of thanks from Collins arrived on Tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted .	4456.098745241275
Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of , cried Colonel Fitzwilliam .	6563.682144390815
I deserve neither such praise nor such censure , cried Elizabeth ;	5920.766674440183
She had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire Militia , in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man , who , on meeting him accidentally in town , had there renewed a slight acquaintance .	3934.094156823656
I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these .	4949.716298741462
No , said her father , Wickham's a fool , if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds .	4787.544530819767
and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane , nor half so good humoured as Lydia .	3997.2275509318524
Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter ;	7733.929680100861
it jumps from admiration to love , from love to matrimony in a moment .	6126.90719007184
As soon as I get to town , I shall go to my brother , and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street , and then we may consult together as to what is to be done .	4107.068260189189
and then , on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured , he replied , Say nothing of that .	4379.18470617896
Certainly not .	18498.8172501179
Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home .	8409.78539583371
and that being the case , I cannot consider your situation with much compassion .	5104.712268856491
He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her .	5533.388506304992
the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy , received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before ;	5097.159575151682
As she had heard no carriage , she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine , and under that apprehension was putting away her half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions , when the door opened , and to her very great surprise , Darcy , and Darcy only , entered the room .	4106.728145108102
That tall , proud man .	10113.896595488373
In the hall they parted .	8226.649395304281
They were hopeless of remedy .	7645.22525829039
After an affectionate parting between the friends , Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Collins , and as they walked down the garden , he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family , not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter , and his compliments to and Gardiner , though unknown .	4157.934739083171
but , recovering herself , said in a lively tone , And pray , what is the usual price of an Earl's younger son ?	4561.193419998929
His most particular friend , you see by Jane's account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her .	5340.988542029535
She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue , and the mere stateliness of money and rank , she thought she could witness without trepidation .	4167.031189091604
You must not disappoint your father .	6460.390916874624
Good girl !	18612.64937059427
Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection , and said something of his concern , at having been prevented by business .	5369.951519717718
You may have drawn him in .	7037.52408491281
He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying ;	5745.329279269149
But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes .	4302.412782220112
If you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence .	5305.891796215582
E3 .	29757.454875608575
I , who have prided myself on my discernment !	6020.819868512369
I beg your pardon , replied Miss Bingley , turning away with a sneer .	4828.977847860729
I am sincerely grieved for him and F but no one can throw any blame on them .	4419.36202009756
But I pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it .	4197.408844715405
He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which it seems he has been told , by some of the good-natured , gossiping Lucases .	4650.586473229745
Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly , as well as her affection for Jane ;	5453.84521069412
I am glad he dines here on Tuesday .	4627.212323766275
Each felt for the other , and of course for themselves ;	8423.026928777459
She saw herself the object of attention , to tens and to scores of them at present unknown .	4989.009872331984
on the contrary , he was all attention to every body .	7482.160289084692
and , having nothing else to say , was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him .	4424.585344814824
but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts ;	5732.370817276923
I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge .	4751.599603402356
you do not know what I suffer .	10302.6343614273
I can now say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , I have seen nothing of it .	4531.200521292261
Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education .	6746.28250779728
shocking !	29757.454875608575
She is a great fool for going away , if she liked him .	4572.617646554383
I am so pleased so happy .	5316.807288691109
Oh !	6826.5207498362
but whatever she said , was spoken in so authoritative a tone , as marked her self-importance , and brought Wickham immediately to Elizabeth's mind ;	4834.972407207656
All was joy and kindness .	11357.202106101882
I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable .	4270.663343307527
and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning .	4111.334371398503
You tear them to pieces .	9112.011185922915
she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him .	5893.486905436368
but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's .	5176.581422546585
but his sisters gave it their hearty assent , and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations .	4551.904091243801
It will be no use to us , if twenty such should come since you will not visit them .	4850.275257620627
but when Philips began to express her concern thereupon , he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance , that he considered the money as a mere trifle , and begged she would not make herself uneasy .	4107.931119050891
She seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute , and never attended to Mary at all .	5141.7015046517645
but with him I believe it does not often happen .	6299.479890868546
In spite of what her sister declared , and really believed to be her feelings , in the expectation of his arrival , Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it .	4370.075753628928
but they obligingly satisfied it , with the same kind of supposition , which had appeased Bennet's curiosity ;	5321.0056091255265
The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value !	5820.24865056516
but their astonishment was beyond their expectation ;	7223.236100232499
Not Lydia only , but all were concerned in it ;	7517.007491882602
They are all for what they can get .	6765.784631058664
and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared .	4472.538611578681
Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony , marriage had always been her object ;	6609.641255801309
And of this place , thought she , I might have been mistress !	6044.230299901712
Well , Monday morning came , and I was in such a fuss !	5774.153461293853
and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again .	4920.3030532773
1 .	12212.55279990698
I confess , said he , that I should not have been at all surprised by her Ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings .	4409.439453408646
determined , if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive , and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female .	4510.562625354852
and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ;	4216.702103506613
In society so superior to what she had generally known , her improvement was great .	5971.274034225153
was fonder than ever of Georgiana , almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore , and paid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth .	5571.02137406325
gone to stay .	18472.368653312184
What will you think of my vanity ?	7906.076980651482
I thought I should have broke my heart .	5555.848762506346
Oh , Lizzy !	8412.633737715443
and therefore checked her laugh .	7376.660297454726
She had never perceived , while the regiment was in Hertfordshire , that Lydia had any partiality for him , but she was convinced that Lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body .	3993.3685307626533
Oh , yes !	6953.750776902737
We must not make him desperate .	7983.2379145862815
and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour , that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford , she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Darcy's having both spent three weeks at Rosings , and asked him if he were acquainted with the former .	3900.676057327647
His father , Miss Bennet , the late Darcy , was one of the best men that ever breathed , and the truest friend I ever had ;	4938.01939972587
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come .	5067.9992477116
It was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too , and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it .	4396.470260574838
They were off Saturday night about twelve , as is conjectured , but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight .	4796.743562687284
What is it you are talking of ?	7324.763402309562
We all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ;	6325.08570777069
His belief of her sister's insensibility , she instantly resolved to be false , and his account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice .	4473.441190173437
and pray when am I to wish you joy ?	6203.440954965192
But I cannot find out that Jane saw any thing of him in London .	4769.590846487013
I have no right to give my opinion , said Wickham , as to his being agreeable or otherwise .	4235.248196496981
Much as I abominate writing , I would not give up Collins's correspondence for any consideration .	6370.608712635893
exclaimed Elizabeth , you are too good .	11054.153240613037
But really , and upon my honour , I will try to do what I think to be wisest ;	4966.394133555561
Lydia , my love , ring the bell .	7890.069822156471
I beg your pardon ;	6975.043428174226
Is there nothing you could take , to give you present relief ?	6986.214361797778
She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution , which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments , which she could not otherwise have failed of ;	4326.546463111656
and in spite of her youth and her manners , she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her .	4168.980072643873
it told them , that on his arrival , he had immediately found out his brother , and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch street .	5163.807640817722
but I heard nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield .	5178.896757615575
but proud and conceited .	9636.33658284548
Now be sincere ;	15631.185103745442
He only told me , what I have now told you .	6128.250833090893
Oh , that I knew how it was !	6696.085205794995
The fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious attention .	5443.0532581832185
and she sat down directly to the instrument .	5415.800388911717
A short pause followed this speech , and Hurst began again .	6808.476615213302
My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them .	6335.646697660611
To no creature had it been revealed , where secresy was possible , except to Elizabeth ;	5965.5525724093095
Oh !	6826.5207498362
Elizabeth thanked him from her heart , and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying .	5317.655725164071
Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility ;	5924.2887780941455
The t te- -t te surprised them .	7675.861997506884
But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire , she saw him from her dressing-room window , enter the paddock , and ride towards the house .	4392.16772235365
All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man , who , but three months before , had been almost an angel of light .	5376.291158555842
said Bennet , more than once , as if the credit of making it rain were all her own .	5739.340733097729
I am excessively attentive to all those things .	5151.754919188667
There was neither in figure nor face , any likeness between the ladies .	5724.379733918982
Bennet rang the bell , and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library .	6449.0273360909605
They were excessively sorry to go !	7160.141891599855
Can this be Darcy !	13070.559258279189
I know how much you dislike him .	6026.139796928074
After watching her a little , Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful .	6423.922283660963
Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case , and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts .	4270.912179411871
You are not well enough ;	6755.276105378785
About the middle of the next day , as she was in her room getting ready for a walk , a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion ;	4968.809539709639
Darcy said nothing at all .	8725.51167489328
At that moment they were met from another walk , by Hurst and Elizabeth herself .	5850.18624629236
repeated Miss Bingley .	17103.64478316344
For the liveliness of your mind , I did .	7788.409699064597
and not a note , not a line , did I receive in the mean time .	5067.692550832024
Bennet , we shall have her at Netherfield at last .	6508.061962708659
But I knew not I was afraid of doing too much .	5163.579744681444
but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing , that instead of twelve , he had brought only six with him from London , his five sisters and a cousin .	4551.1431367811165
CHAPTER XII .	13083.650239159624
They talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his fruit , of every thing but himself ;	5333.935385352182
Well , he certainly is very agreeable , and I give you leave to like him .	5290.774585226935
Their first subject was her sister ;	8829.793252846588
and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them , threw a real gloom over their domestic circle ;	4388.760760903737
She wrote cheerfully , seemed surrounded with comforts , and mentioned nothing which she could not praise .	5315.465659490584
Balls will be absolutely prohibited , unless you stand up with one of your sisters .	6848.7535393645785
There can be no occasion for your going so soon .	6680.266012354639
I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure .	4090.616204627116
With many compliments to them , and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter , to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ;	4766.421342003063
It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs , under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants , and heedless of the future , must be very insufficient to their support ;	4263.233449979009
Would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part , that might offer consolation to such distress .	5682.676855363189
The dinner was exceedingly handsome , and there were all the servants , and all the articles of plate which Collins had promised ;	4777.964114874513
I rather wonder now at your knowing any .	6499.425433582351
and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement .	4670.508589409234
Mary and Kitty , thank Heaven !	9341.010512768928
She could only imagine however at last , that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible , according to his ideas of right , than in any other person present .	4155.6674152466185
Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room .	5647.001539984145
The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again , called it an age since they had met , and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation .	4379.592792344896
You supposed more than really existed .	8409.953421908764
and , though little more than sixteen , her figure was formed , and her appearance womanly and graceful .	4386.921574099813
and when she wrote again , Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys .	4370.287245751638
In Lydia's imagination , a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness .	6134.496374041455
I was never more annoyed !	6107.384388660532
You have .	9934.624866115235
Indeed , replied Elizabeth , I am heartily sorry for him ;	6871.084289182306
The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion , and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone .	4669.765266093202
and as to my father , I never in my life saw him so affected .	4304.689025499619
- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies you in writing ( or by e-mail ) within <TIME_PERIOD > of receipt that s he does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm License .	4314.398734444689
and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled , she had all the success she expected .	4731.819310670487
That is a question which I hardly know how to answer .	5504.654641624044
Are the others coming out ?	11089.378747968722
I do not know .	3780.23139418018
That it ought not to be attempted .	8320.190090398086
But at length , by Elizabeth's persuasion , he was prevailed on to overlook the offence , and seek a reconciliation ;	4910.582473893486
We are not in a way to know what Bingley likes , said her mother resentfully , since we are not to visit .	4938.981136632596
It was the prospect of constant society , and good society , he added , which was my chief inducement to enter the shire .	4231.342455439577
single , my dear , to be sure !	9607.781212871148
You will have a charming mother-in-law , indeed , and of course she will be always at Pemberley with you .	4853.756317935613
Elizabeth was now to see Wickham for the last time .	5513.27855635377
but not handsome enough to tempt me ;	7618.656090504578
US laws alone swamp our small staff .	11054.031130354546
with less of splendor , and more real elegance , than the furniture of Rosings .	6887.274170724783
she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us , and offered her services , or any of her daughters , if they could be of use to us .	4873.247307239757
What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation ?	6456.3646422505635
I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned .	4089.4502295770812
Hear me in silence .	15633.167043926136
Neglect !	29757.454875608575
but , to counterbalance these advantages , Darcy had considerable patronage in the church , and his cousin could have none at all .	4539.978245436915
Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place ?	5797.21479394603
It makes me very nervous and poorly , to be thwarted so in my own family , and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else .	4722.736419876241
Darcy looked up .	11710.451043773277
She was teazed by Collins , who continued most perseveringly by her side , and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again , put it out of her power to dance with others .	4006.2282590921673
At four o'clock , therefore , we may expect this peace-making gentleman , said Bennet , as he folded up the letter .	5309.4683818741805
How should you have liked making sermons ?	8514.773361166099
What could he mean ?	9929.04639259683
I have told Miss Bennet several times , that she will never play really well , unless she practises more ;	4422.512244966608
he is a most interesting young man ;	8748.742071218348
Well , I was so frightened I did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ;	4767.6137129187
Our habits of expence make us too dependant , and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money .	5159.366531920099
And your defect is a propensity to hate every body .	6702.696403897979
We are not rich enough , or grand enough for them ;	6321.634728994661
Elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness , with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal .	5081.695660825775
They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds .	6685.504857224228
1 .	12212.55279990698
In a short time , I shall have a daughter married .	6101.874689603682
but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art ;	6682.9859212348965
Charlotte the wife of Collins , was a most humiliating picture !	7763.744435108689
With my mother up stairs .	10603.59230525733
On this subject I have nothing more to say , no other apology to offer .	5912.681098222308
Though Darcy could never receive him at Pemberley , yet , for Elizabeth's sake , he assisted him farther in his profession .	5568.210046119974
I can much more easily believe Bingley's being imposed on , than that Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night ;	4388.731809159141
I cannot acquit him of that duty ;	5982.252215891733
Good Heaven !	15987.831621001465
Maria thought speaking out of the question , and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire .	6572.278046842167
Imprudent as a marriage between Wickham and our poor Lydia would be , we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place , for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland .	4560.449043637263
I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner .	5157.63711706099
They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation , and always spending more than they ought .	4674.0275158169225
and no less certain is it , that I cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it .	4740.597018646139
He only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town , which you must acknowledge to be true .	4496.163696006968
Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth , which spoke her distress at such premeditation , and her intreaty that she would not give into it .	5082.5399862135155
He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him ;	5591.41974499655
and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry .	4179.262817888428
Poor Lydia's situation must , at best , be bad enough ;	7710.139856062717
and therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , I will take it on myself .	4544.4252813703915
The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed , by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking ;	4525.574351941987
It was not in their direct road , nor more than a mile or two out of it .	4316.315655427057
As for Mary , she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection , soon after they were seated at table , This is a most unfortunate affair ;	4493.554505391488
Well , said Charlotte , I wish Jane success with all my heart ;	5652.279681028131
that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars , and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer .	4096.30063169786
By you , I was properly humbled .	9421.692354952316
While settling this point , she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell , and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself , who had once before called late in the evening , and might now come to enquire particularly after her .	4297.187518507514
1 .	12212.55279990698
Oh !	6826.5207498362
Whatever can give his sister any pleasure , is sure to be done in a moment .	6244.023486103568
Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves ?	9410.632575874568
but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her , that she was only exceedingly shy .	4926.753945303899
And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last November , for had it been otherwise , I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace .	4353.01146246165
' Are any of your younger sisters out , Miss Bennet ?	7793.077222544604
Multiple superscripted characters are enclosed by curly brackets ( example : M rs ) .	7377.456950970888
she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not to believe it , and could not help saying so .	4527.525938894658
He should be particularly happy at any time , c .	6678.523859093496
The perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing , or on the evenness of his lines , or on the length of his letter , with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received , formed a curious dialogue , and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each .	4144.033116861805
Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1 .	6324.39919875417
If he wants our society , let him seek it .	6235.963721178425
As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their aunt , and all Collins's scruples of leaving and Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted , the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton ;	4335.633734616281

With respect to Wickham , the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation ;	5607.762672816451
It did .	12722.792966766598
He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her ;	6212.251772221005
CHAPTER XIII .	11746.06741553873
They battled it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved .	5099.514716733284
but really considering his descent , one could not expect much better .	6129.186304284427
After a short pause , her companion added , You are too generous to trifle with me .	5518.298620750593
They can only wish his happiness , and if he is attached to me , no other woman can secure it .	5250.456035810492
I admire the activity of your benevolence , observed Mary , but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason ;	4863.720083342883
I hope you saw her petticoat , six inches deep in mud , I am absolutely certain ;	4737.045251339438
They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time , and though I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions , I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible .	4327.4140385156325
I thought I should have died .	6005.941316547074
and , before Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt , of which her daughter sat in momentary dread , Bingley , who wanted to be alone with Jane , proposed their all walking out .	3972.3190974371964
It needed all Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity .	6008.161291028557
You alluded to something else .	9112.011185922915
He promises fairly , and I hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent .	4774.702429657873
and indeed , before we left Bakewell , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country .	4737.327937976405
and on these occasions , Gardiner , rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's warm commendation of him , narrowly observed them both .	4567.017217759161
Respect , esteem , and confidence , had vanished for ever ;	8422.884624479988
and he went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town .	4602.22704548883
Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly ;	9239.82149738245
Those to her mother , contained little else , than that they were just returned from the library , where such and such officers had attended them , and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild ;	4659.607503743774
but would my giving you the wished-for promise , make their marriage at all more probable ?	5530.21040083179
Nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the United States .	6048.963067356584
But I hope you will get over it , and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood .	4063.630072869854
The recollection of what I then said , of my conduct , my manners , my expressions during the whole of it , is now , and has been many months , inexpressibly painful to me .	4446.7402378255765
Aye , no doubt ;	13069.809499020854
She said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence ;	5519.416923457705
We cannot suppose he would help it , if he could .	6949.074050453492
I am the happiest creature in the world .	4195.864838793549
and then you must stay all night .	5937.221413224863
How could he spare half ten thousand pounds ?	7235.227505571571
Perhaps by and bye I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones .	6221.050442355683
Though Elizabeth would not , for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine , have answered this question ;	6021.53402271047
What you ask , said Elizabeth , is no sacrifice on my side ;	6404.399963280455
She was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ;	5127.585418465556
I must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from declaring my amazement , at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married .	3926.818851341829
to the young ladies he certainly was nothing ;	8881.38573836635
Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort , much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements .	5651.705015725199
and how Lydia could ever have attached him , had appeared incomprehensible .	5724.785083062155
My uncle is to send a servant for us .	7141.537215144067
I see the imprudence of it .	6972.617567757974
Books Oh !	22757.11010138367
I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well and indeed so I do still at my heart ;	4876.040445511028
Scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning , but their visit to Rosings .	6509.574002534723
I was ready to die of laughter .	5961.897306362744
I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible .	4425.206807812432
CHAPTER XXII .	15231.67119605404
but consider how much it must increase his disappointment .	6863.254556500518
Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall ;	6040.530190582761
Elizabeth's courage did not fail her .	10644.5571306853
and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations .	4412.2314019238565
is not there a little mistake ?	11106.801923151577
The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends ;	5094.262473539848
Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above-mentioned ;	6927.246443253133
We have not met since the 26th of November , when we were all dancing together at Netherfield .	5246.220894553281
Are you not diverted ?	11156.977942746094
The communication excited many professions of concern ;	7675.607661452701
He came to tell Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both , Wickham repeatedly , Lydia once .	4501.132040860159
each of them deep in thought .	12171.203962187625
You saw me dance at Meryton , I believe , Yes , indeed , and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight .	5080.8514619285515
Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother , but remained quietly in the hall , till she and Kitty were out of sight , then returned into the drawing-room .	4368.017289998761
and as she walked up and down the room , endeavouring to compose herself , saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt , as made every thing worse .	3842.963105883711
With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family , and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton , sometimes dirty and sometimes cold , did January and February pass away .	4681.457201832631
Darcy smiled ;	14126.48371094987
but to speak with such civility , to enquire after her family !	5825.127522254776
and Sir William , to Elizabeth's high diversion , was stationed in the doorway , in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him , and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that way .	4310.84523808417
Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship .	5950.400774387954
A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued , on either side calm and concise and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister , just returned from their walk .	4496.262092608733
Could I expect it to be otherwise !	9847.072484464205
and soon laying it wholly aside , she drew near the card-table , and stationed herself between Bingley and his eldest sister , to observe the game .	4526.873979226263
To and Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself .	6357.920531905675
I do , I do like him , she replied , with tears in her eyes , I love him .	4207.761292344178
Yes , she will do for him very well .	6089.563063210636
and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again .	4642.856943616927
To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted , than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement .	5318.867669676782
But if we do not venture , somebody else will ;	5882.7550150802135
The invitation was accepted of course , and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine's drawing-room .	5169.393395104246
It has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling .	5951.622154183187
and she read it again .	6109.391972173803
It is impossible that he should still love me .	5259.025238890984
but though he was now established only as a tenant , Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table , nor was Hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her .	4071.7568933838047
The eldest of them , a sensible , intelligent young woman , about twenty-seven , was Elizabeth's intimate friend .	5251.779830669973
Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding , and made no answer .	5376.626335003281
Her carriage remained at the door , and Elizabeth saw that her waiting-woman was in it .	5736.77657626863
In this quiet way , the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away .	5806.779328631891
but at last on Bennet's leaving them together , after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master , she could not help saying , Oh !	4427.104485302685
I rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it would happen .	5278.546501940223
and it was settled that Jones should be sent for early in the morning , if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better .	4227.594771005351
Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's meditated elopement .	6412.481868845151
I knew you would be wishing me joy .	6133.965551504644
His letter was soon dispatched ;	9932.606850071577
do we ?	20295.41770017404
To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying .	7601.300684964719
We dine at Rosings twice every week , and are never allowed to walk home .	6091.9103482534
I do not know who is good enough for him .	3799.51998147527
But Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on , in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice .	4271.5320171465255
Then , perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying , she added , Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson ;	4856.023663097085
These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship , and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay .	5084.1203128206425
Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit .	8102.512732193453
and were informed that it was but just done , to give pleasure to Miss Darcy , who had taken a liking to the room , when last at Pemberley .	4365.078633940961
but why did not you tell me so before ?	6863.254556500518
To walk three miles , or four miles , or five miles , or whatever it is , above her ancles in dirt , and alone , quite alone !	4884.041822053889
But , my dearest Jane , you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday , or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend .	3625.41380164884
'Tis an etiquette I despise , said he .	9410.536115455427
This part of his intelligence , though unheard by Lydia , was caught by Elizabeth , and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make .	4010.7663369942584
Well , my dear , said Bennet , when Elizabeth had read the note aloud , if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness , if she should die , it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Bingley , and under your orders .	3840.68923909128
At least , you should not remind your Mother of inviting him .	6562.282317070148
Allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not disgrace you , and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear Miss Eliza , ( glancing at her sister and Bingley , ) shall take place .	4417.147477198445
but as I have actually paid the visit , we cannot escape the acquaintance now .	5292.49180643722
She is not such a simpleton .	6545.702371646106
I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs , absurd and impertinent .	4577.978635823608
but he had something to direct his search , which was more than we had ;	4975.912143793177
There he had talked to her friends , when he could not to herself .	6231.500282235553
His circumstances , he assured me , and I had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad .	5433.29568299217
My father was not only fond of this young man's society , whose manners were always engaging ;	5303.1722550837285
Oh !	6826.5207498362
for mine is totally different .	9919.165777015727
It was the second week in May , in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch-street , for the town of in Hertfordshire ;	4127.385114548391
If there were but such another man for you !	6757.985959613205
Pray make my excuses to Pratt , for not keeping my engagement , and dancing with him to-night .	6063.521178603792
If I have wounded your sister's feelings , it was unknowingly done ;	5714.757992262557
Bingley followed his advice .	11714.70254949333
and after all , Long and her nieces must stand their chance ;	5326.45761313714
She declared her resolution .	9594.870681843948
He made no answer .	8019.915861116387
and really , all things considered , I begin to think it perfectly reasonable .	5337.829532658579
Promise me , therefore , to come to Hunsford .	9476.25506151308
and so generous , that you will always exceed your income .	5564.54508101738
We must not all expect Jane's good fortune .	7090.739777624358
and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued , I remember , when we first knew her in Hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ;	4009.0922387325695
I beg you will not go .	6741.11861202205
A report of a most alarming nature , reached me two days ago .	6481.166854237239
His affection was proved to have been sincere , and his conduct cleared of all blame , unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend .	4742.386233530732
No ;	15660.948551348763
Yes , yes .	9127.274403465812
She is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else .	4642.400259588929
whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish .	6072.280087146251
and , in my opinion , exertion should always be in proportion to what is required .	4399.965227956657
Did you speak from your own observation , said she , when you told him that my sister loved him , or merely from my information last spring ?	4915.791507368198
The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation .	6291.174220088676
Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight , but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction .	4963.22075022332
Any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn , I suppose , would appear far .	6887.791961758871
I want to talk very seriously .	6807.4472916466775
Who are your uncles and aunts ?	10644.5571306853
This was agreed to , and Philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets , and a little bit of hot supper afterwards .	4636.568122346484
A man of honour could not have doubted the intention , but Darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation , and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance , imprudence , in short any thing or nothing .	4243.929401876073
Where does discretion end , and avarice begin ?	9533.8906793828
and , allowing for the loss of Sir William , and there being only one card table in the evening , every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first .	4120.593801840002
When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over , he naturally returned to all his former indolence .	4811.14157816614
CHAPTER IX .	11746.06741553873
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her sister , and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case , was almost incredible !	4473.694456512843
He saw Wickham , and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia .	6678.523859093496
Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them .	7213.34609467939
You know I have .	8460.944729424431
It will then be publicly seen , that on both sides , we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance .	4918.1164288404525
He wrote last week to hurry my return .	7120.709804949499
Jane then took it from her pocket-book , and gave it to Elizabeth .	6584.053039243611
There is but such a quantity of merit between them ;	6033.724728853695
As she spoke , she observed him looking at her earnestly , and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness , convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth .	4296.075878275975
Well , and so we breakfasted at ten as usual ;	5927.478692803739
Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her .	11276.841140791801
And this is your real opinion !	7609.181530048953
and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her , was still more strange .	4985.676611833166
She felt that she had no business at Pemberley , and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it .	4824.1989919869175
but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it ;	5050.869361824675
and he soon afterwards said aloud , Bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day ?	4412.4144164512145
Before Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise , Bennet instantly answered , Oh dear !	6175.077552967053
and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her , was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held .	4302.840932524936
And you saw him frequently ?	8169.737180745399
DEAR SIR , The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father , always gave me much uneasiness , and since I have had the misfortune to lose him , I have frequently wished to heal the breach ;	4731.335701387107
No , I should have turned in a moment .	6051.034156119239
Could he , or the Lucases , have pitched on any man , within the circle of our acquaintance , whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related ?	4809.310133527193
we talked and laughed so loud , that any body might have heard us ten miles off !	6377.244804350366
and , on the father's , from respectable , honourable , and ancient , though untitled families .	4612.884444131991
She was now , on being settled at home , at leisure to observe the real state of her sister's spirits .	4395.50784805453
so , it will be impossible for her to introduce him , for she will not know him herself .	5814.954630285425
What think you of this sentence , my dear Lizzy ?	6653.290409104453
Jane's is nothing to it nothing at all .	8956.23713256274
How could she deny that credit to his assertions , in one instance , which she had been obliged to give in the other ?	4898.2220962552
I dare say the lace upon Hurst's gown Here she was interrupted again .	5095.310916191585
and Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn , nothing remained to be done but to go ;	4900.580584712924
Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible .	7608.847057073828
and there is no occasion for talking to him , except just now and then .	5130.318853131793
I dearly love a laugh .	8206.702495836793
but without much success .	9636.33658284548
They saw him often , and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve .	5540.624797658703
said he , with a look of doubt .	7151.462977281089
Poor Eliza !	18859.062262567415
Speak to Lizzy about it yourself .	12171.203962187625
Not at all , was her answer ;	7558.881711544151
The same anxiety to get them by themselves , was visible again in the evening .	5437.214985800282
But he is an ugly fellow !	6791.3027812210785
Yes , yes , they must marry .	6784.984964365879
Thursday was to be the wedding day , and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit ;	6689.083955578271
and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future ;	4121.423702013497
but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at .	5852.523110236429
Remember that she is one of a large family ;	9475.98293518256
They called at various times of the morning , sometimes separately , sometimes together , and now and then accompanied by their aunt .	5103.698544102418
Bingley , his two sisters , the husband of the eldest , and another young man .	5856.271555845348
Intimate as you are , you must know how it is to be done .	6983.539049508394
My father supported him at school , and afterwards at Cambridge ;	6152.319615124864
for when supper was over , singing was talked of , and she had the mortification of seeing Mary , after very little entreaty , preparing to oblige the company .	4794.174566285383
and their conversation , which had been passing while and Gardiner were engaged with their children , was now put an end to , by the approach of the whole party .	4258.090218670046
But Georgiana would not join her .	8075.492646678731
With respect to that other , more weighty accusation , of having injured Wickham , I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family .	4704.583630705133
Yet the misery , for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation , received soon afterwards material relief , from observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her former lover .	4767.368414809166
Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile .	7861.744818784409
It distressed her a little , and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage .	4977.9891569760275
But I have other provocations .	6236.9440499952225
He studies too much for words of four syllables .	6974.955170522214
From their infancy , they have been intended for each other .	7228.246162130595
he had all the best part of beauty , a fine countenance , a good figure , and very pleasing address .	5232.150224241945
and she asked Bingley , whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present .	4555.914067466198
They followed her into the dining-parlour .	8774.131301208306
and after some contrivance , the whole party , with all their boxes , workbags , and parcels , and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's and Lydia's purchases , were seated in it .	4236.426395394867
On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls , whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room , and whose shyness , as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth , prevented their coming lower .	4261.969698602618
but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour .	5315.847199288117
and on his return , brought back , with great satisfaction , a message from her Ladyship , importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her .	4135.810315032262
I have no reason , I assure you , said he , to be dissatisfied with my reception .	3963.5117229940156
In essentials , I believe , he is very much what he ever was .	6011.727589926771
Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday ;	9686.967842588996
and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there ;	5229.4698502345245
and they soon became sensible , that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old , and whose own manners indicated respectability , was not to be hastily rejected .	4157.2325907466175
Bromley , of course .	15633.167043926136
Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth , where confidence would give pleasure ;	6584.102803071786
What congratulations will then flow in !	9136.71341938942
My dear Bennet , said his lady to him one day , have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last ?	4425.124834145254
His countenance rather gained in austerity ;	8799.394070752383
The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family , connections , or fortune .	5820.24865056516
I do not know of any other designs that he had formed : but he was in such a hurry to be gone , and his spirits so greatly discomposed , that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this .	3642.1242024918442
He has always something to say to every body .	5850.5300217298045
but there were two or three much uglier in the shop ;	5940.195509773339
If he wishes to avoid seeing me , he must go .	6025.778417396053
Have you not heard me say , that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ?	5803.559643283286
and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before , was now high in her good graces .	4410.312943683955
she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ;	7233.988479162111
Bennet , you are wanted immediately ;	8017.028713439182
My real purpose was to see you , and to judge , if I could , whether I might ever hope to make you love me .	4937.772909941095
Oh !	6826.5207498362
He made a little mistake to be sure ;	6975.95299718581
This event had at last been despaired of , but it was then too late to be saving .	5676.162785975176
On this subject , what can you have to say ?	6802.356593138422
But will they make you happy ?	8075.492646678731
She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment ;	5893.478651937946
There could be no conversation in the noise of Philips's supper party , but his manners recommended him to every body .	5144.973738290338
An union of a different tendency , and precluding the possibility of the other , was soon to be formed in their family .	5571.153105208245
Yes ;	11624.632075734577
Elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ;	5385.611819203114
Did you see him while you were at Lambton ?	7607.784427558194
I do comprehend a great deal in it .	5398.684469265249
Did she call to refuse her consent ?	9631.875019440824
They must have seen them together for ever .	7317.498607895379
With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew ;	8933.871363296728
I am sure my sisters must all envy me .	4352.21476266708
I hope we may often meet again .	6193.355548148088
There was not much in the question , nor in the preceding remark , but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning .	4677.327248737734
She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of Darcy's sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , she turned up the lane , which led her farther from the turnpike road .	4039.528192224206
His sister was less delicate , and directed her eye towards Darcy with a very expressive smile .	5748.00404479106
Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend .	5051.77872102566
I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Bingley .	4107.660930174148
Bingley is most unaffectedly modest .	10491.204892994789
With a renewal of tenderness , however , they repaired to her room on leaving the dining-parlour , and sat with her till summoned to coffee .	4909.545524645285
Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment .	3985.250218590545
With a glance she saw , that he had lost none of his recent civility ;	5878.286028303434
Would Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it ?	6107.636747313245
But above all , above respect and esteem , there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked .	4931.515322345687
There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others .	4917.4870546243965
And as I come back , I can call on Lady Lucas and Long .	5795.742740331311
She will be down in a moment I dare say .	5498.9146778527975
There is nothing he would not do for her .	5976.550166197426
and for your own , let her be an active , useful sort of person , not brought up high , but able to make a small income go a good way .	4373.148181652887
Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed .	5756.771117207482
The dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last ;	6372.72806691619
At length , in a voice of forced calmness , he said , And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting !	4567.0219893464855
she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld !	7595.421979192578
The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton ;	6618.13045543331
Very odd !	18193.912977931544
Her teeth are tolerable , but not out of the common way ;	6555.922367737725
They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in ;	5865.316576226505
but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable , they are not , I hope , quite so easily changed as that implies .	4253.010854903756
[ Illustration : DOVE-DALE ] PRIDE PREJUDICE .	9757.93559607512
Lady Catherine is a very respectable , sensible woman indeed , added Charlotte , and a most attentive neighbour .	4939.467484538763
and as for Hurst , by whom Elizabeth sat , he was an indolent man , who lived only to eat , drink , and play at cards , who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout , had nothing to say to her .	3829.005142471347
and when Bingley was gone , Jane constantly sought the same means of relief .	4942.699174179614
and the kind of half-expectation which Gardiner had formed , of their being followed by a letter from him , had ended in nothing .	4341.3274077107
She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter .	5387.9054782143785
After wandering along the lane for two hours , giving way to every variety of thought ;	6075.887310570626
and such I might still have been but for you , dearest , loveliest Elizabeth !	5436.074536396465
Much had been done , and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday ;	6427.958157201235
And his behaviour , so strikingly altered , what could it mean ?	6374.112036612503
My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking .	5230.70115350628
It was gratitude .	7384.126329755981
One morning , about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been formed , as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining-room , their attention was suddenly drawn to the window , by the sound of a carriage ;	4434.418157767845
Certainly , he replied , biting his lips .	8858.798873033322
I honour your circumspection .	8941.469901604298
and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general , he can have no objection , I am sure , to oblige us for one half hour .	4018.0660650075606
Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these .	7967.435426764204
He is gone to my father already .	6503.266020922813
When the ladies were separating for the toilette , he said to Elizabeth , Do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your apparel .	4398.316472119714
He bore it with noble indifference , and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy , had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Darcy , with an expression of half-laughing alarm .	4283.167710625528
and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery .	4023.1726862024425
and Wickham had constant admission to the house .	6410.588794260085
and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly commendable , and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate , will be kindly overlooked on your side , and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch .	3920.5970632045687
she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood , nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two , to visit his relations .	4651.143661516497
but she had not got beyond the words delightful , and charming , when some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her , might be mischievously construed .	4147.385613145237
Very well and this offer of marriage you have refused ?	7621.486363926025
My dear Hill , have you heard the good news ?	5939.6928689892975
They crossed it by a simple bridge , in character with the general air of the scene ;	5639.130842912865
You appear to me , Darcy , to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection .	5515.811102672736
Well , and so just as the carriage came to the door , my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Stone .	4581.921979705127
In my opinion , the younger son of an Earl can know very little of either .	5720.295925448517
and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification .	5061.378745240665
Had you then persuaded yourself that I should ?	8281.730291275486
and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling .	4566.688872845736
that if he is so , you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me .	5657.673565760997
and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night , she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon .	4434.647862111806
I do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Darcy .	3790.2557857164297
Had she merely dined with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ;	5650.323677419684
but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him .	5420.053833477594
dear Lizzy , only consider what he must have suffered .	8678.48360421885
I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure .	5156.5074062418
That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side , too , was another very welcome surprise ;	5382.046252411672
In spite of having been at James's , Sir William was so completely awed , by the grandeur surrounding him , that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow , and take his seat without saying a word ;	4226.2485681718435
my dear , cried his wife , I cannot bear to hear that mentioned .	5687.2183379695625
You can now have nothing farther to say , she resentfully answered .	5896.916560396047
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States .	4832.188310152531
How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year !	5530.6271018853295
Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Philips , and she ventured , without any permission , to do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton .	4680.847139991433
Her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour : his judgment could not err , and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth , as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable .	4436.45513013254
and he found in Philips a very attentive listener , whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard , and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could .	4068.9322257313875
When Lydia went away , she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and Kitty ;	5566.193721473291
It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom .	4831.161406709646
Their eyes instantly met , and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush .	6001.13089856327
Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed , as to leave her very little attention for her book ;	4748.7784995999045
She was even sensible of some pleasure , though mixed with regret , on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Darcy and herself .	4062.808780529144
and she was more grieved than astonished to hear , in reply to her minute enquiries , that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits , there were periods of dejection .	3917.4024722913355
And may I ask ?	10340.51877021935
In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure , said Bingley ;	6186.979432326711
and more than once during dinner did Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth , I am glad you are come back , Lizzy .	4656.49110219373
your father of course may spare you , if your mother can .	7716.627457159205
and of late it has been shifting about pretty much .	6248.2743661024315
its solace was visiting and news .	11488.36171746244
Have you seen any pleasant men ?	9674.365800128291
But Bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own .	5302.341713753643
Elizabeth hesitated , but her knees trembled under her , and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them .	4955.200676668526
You have only proved by this , cried Elizabeth , that Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition .	4807.198765143033
but I believe we must abide by our original plan .	5579.246356016996
for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health , and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight .	4513.861859383989
That is all to be forgot .	6996.710775261148
and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Bennet's being quite unable to sit alone .	4196.43796431969
You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night .	5430.177106256308
Yes , I really believe Darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care .	4869.2349871482775
She is up stairs , and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all .	5084.875364928698
With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added , How long did you say that he was at Rosings ?	5577.030854434764
People did say , you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas ;	7400.053211685994
She put down the letter , weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality deliberated on the probability of each statement but with little success .	4733.499953228094
Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing , after all .	8422.884624479988
But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side , said Jane .	4797.693665032562
Implacable resentment is a shade in a character .	10178.436969860899
FITZWILLIAM DARCY .	22757.11010138367
Your reproof , so well applied , I shall never forget : 'had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner .	5141.194705355935
at first .	21632.83805867054
The letter shall certainly be burnt , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard ;	5142.480379373418
And there is something of dignity in his countenance , that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart .	5036.594708230578
Oh !	6826.5207498362
Her father , contented with laughing at them , would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters ;	5028.468519074254
Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow , and sat down again to her work , with an eagerness which it did not often command .	4548.032903234089
and , alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother , we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London .	4289.7847178413485
to the last .	14942.839792678991
Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt , and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description , when Hurst called them to order , with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward .	4300.978293231049
Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea , and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies .	4648.967098221813
And you only the second .	8476.385738115614
Philips was always glad to see her nieces , and the two eldest , from their recent absence , were particularly welcome , and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home , which , as their own carriage had not fetched them , she should have known nothing about , if she had not happened to see Jones's shop boy in the street , who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away , when her civility was claimed towards Collins by Jane's introduction of him .	3941.179120670013
What a letter is this , to be written at such a moment .	5916.382550842939
for though the chief of his concerns , with the son of his patron , were imperfectly understood , it was yet a well known fact that , on his quitting Derbyshire , he had left many debts behind him , which Darcy afterwards discharged .	4270.638915129893
There are few people whom I really love , and still fewer of whom I think well .	5315.876315509931
His debts to be discharged , and something still to remain !	6860.728623888818
and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino , the two girls had the honour of assisting Jenkinson to make up her party .	4273.418560522877
It soothed , but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self-attracted by the rest of her family ;	4908.65480695929
But your family owe me nothing .	7807.283533055329
Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad ?	6155.5285255090375
Oh !	6826.5207498362

Even Elizabeth began to fear not that Bingley was indifferent but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away .	5892.676753405973
The satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her husband , might then have rested in its proper place .	4710.350557632563
and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs , to think of any thing else .	3904.8669994125103
but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line .	5823.890403799351
I believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as I do .	5398.533145851936
The party seemed so well selected , so suitable one with the other .	5765.679260335324
But when they see , as I trust they will , that their brother is happy with me , they will learn to be contented , and we shall be on good terms again ;	4229.3397646073045
Do let us have a little music , cried Miss Bingley , tired of a conversation in which she had no share .	5260.678417339042
She answered in the affirmative , and , unable to resist the temptation , added , When you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance .	4364.648607076025
It was not known that Wickham had a single relation , with whom he kept up any connection , and it was certain that he had no near one living .	4018.0301129295894
and Elizabeth , after all the misery of the morning , found herself , in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed , seated in the carriage , and on the road to Longbourn .	4050.9474570297803
It is every way horrible !	6507.312774570377
cried Miss Bingley , Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable .	6622.246423286658
and the other , that she herself had been barbarously used by them all ;	4655.133392889093
The usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter .	6162.242380864301
It is unaccountable !	7477.649036229891
Bennet made no answer , and each of them , deep in thought , continued silent till they reached the house .	4785.359003452217
The others have been gone on to Scarborough , these three weeks .	6025.03249631546
I am not likely to leave Kent for some time .	4325.545611993093
I am thinking of what you have been telling me , said she .	4428.305629218879
he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen !	7360.579544633309
I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals , but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them .	3917.8632067054527
About a month , said Elizabeth ;	9390.822439619329
She could think of nothing more to say ;	5303.318440844462
I am very glad you liked her .	4431.308536615277
He called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil , which had been brought on by himself .	4761.331114944386
You are all kindness , Madam ;	6547.262355451714
She will follow wherever Lydia leads .	7149.280340722726
What a contrast between him and his friend !	7149.943695544861
Ah !	22111.518280636905
indeed you have no reason .	13144.561671774996
In her own past behaviour , there was a constant source of vexation and regret ;	5857.367714813381
If I may so express it , he has a right to be proud .	5549.784809305843
Only think of its being three months , she cried , since I went away ;	6536.54262181948
if the first , I should be completely in your way ;	7824.967168996279
He was as generous , she doubted not , as the most generous of his sex .	4847.26588748131
And this , cried Darcy , as he walked with quick steps across the room , is your opinion of me !	4928.212163909623
If I , said Collins , were so fortunate as to be able to sing , I should have great pleasure , I am sure , in obliging the company with an air ;	4146.50178133892
and Lydia , in a voice rather louder than any other person's , was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her .	4438.81660258231
She seems perfectly happy , however , and in a prudential light , it is certainly a very good match for her .	4928.785902683023
E1 .	22655.2237901027
Invented by M rs Bell 26 Charlotte Street Bedford Square .	8901.060544562486
and had some new extracts to admire , and some new observations of thread-bare morality to listen to .	4911.632535067757
True , said Bennet , but it is a comfort to think that , whatever of that kind may befal you , you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it .	4911.225311371093
certainly , said Elizabeth , though burning with curiosity ;	9477.704310290503
or , with a mind so occupied , she might have forgotten where she was .	6265.358124805739
Oh !	6826.5207498362
Regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure , but I wrote to Wickham , who left the place immediately , and Younge was of course removed from her charge .	5117.047243018812
I know it cannot be long .	5954.1508050027005
My beauty you had early withstood , and as for my manners my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not .	4439.579651350431
But there was still something lurking behind , of which prudence forbad the disclosure .	5309.073232213281
These were the contents : MY DEAR HARRIET , You will laugh when you know where I am gone , and I cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning , as soon as I am missed .	4636.196244904757
and every body began to find out , that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness .	4798.632271283392
But I ought to beg his pardon , for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant .	4462.225727131753
With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted !	7486.881373978882
She had high animal spirits , and a sort of natural self-consequence , which the attentions of the officers , to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her , had increased into assurance .	4116.302558796915
but unable to contain herself , began scolding one of her daughters .	5512.488727624532
Heaven forbid !	17926.079642662262
and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again .	5558.547907527809
Colonel Forster came yesterday , having left Brighton the day before , not many hours after the express .	5697.9678306888745
Not a word , however , passed his lips in allusion to it , till their visitor took his leave for the night ;	5086.398502099224
It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Darcy than they had before any idea of ;	4615.472513810588
I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude .	4760.151124215231
but now , as soon as they were alone together , she said , I saw you look at me to-day , Lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present report ;	4026.7129249778322
Lydia was Lydia still ;	11744.557344549976
I should have considered it as part of my duty , and the exertion would soon have been nothing .	4661.052912250351
I was very uncomfortable , I may say unhappy .	5401.323047009298
And your assurance of it , I suppose , carried immediate conviction to him .	5880.0914747361585
and Mary , at the end of a long concerto , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs , at the request of her younger sisters , who with some of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room .	3939.7826898505223
though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them .	4942.731076727987
To work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures ;	6723.957524388435
He could even listen to Sir William Lucas , when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country , and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at James's , with very decent composure .	4283.154034169187
and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own .	4111.52395808831
and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and at first was resolved not to break it ;	4140.688109442254
Her mind was less difficult to develope .	8106.088669800178
Oh !	6826.5207498362
that of Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest ;	9194.10316722992
Instead of viewing them as a stranger , I might have rejoiced in them as my own , and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt .	5181.008832955579
and as Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her's , it was performed in a proper manner , without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary .	4045.67813652395
was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room , and from all the others when they sat down to table .	4958.948432021645
his sisters declared that they were miserable .	9767.695682389953
It had not been very great ;	7441.561611483636
You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary , compressed , marked up , nonproprietary or proprietary form , including any word processing or hypertext form .	4431.61356842641
And so , my dear sister , I find from our uncle and aunt , that you have actually seen Pemberley .	4574.361899888278
The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week ;	6162.242380864301
I do , indeed , replied Elizabeth , colouring .	5103.545955557424
A person may be proud without being vain .	8091.7293118139205
For the truth of every thing here related , I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam , who from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the executors of my father's will , has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions .	4272.420466324471
I shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his constancy .	5042.235718771566
I should never have said Collins was settled near her family .	5221.0904855072595
Wretched , wretched , mistake !	13637.93872720995
Those who do not complain are never pitied .	9261.827231910876

How differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned !	6641.747250590892
Elizabeth , you are not serious now .	6586.988619946973
All this was acknowledged to Gardiner ;	9949.704906845667
What a fine thing for our girls !	7556.903383245543
You did !	13070.950981546295
No man of common humanity , no man who had any value for his character , could be capable of it .	5412.152043629816
but at length was reduced to be reasonable .	6747.97917706862
It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Bingley to see you all after him so soon ;	4869.716439761825
An excellent consolation in its way , said Elizabeth , but it will not do for us .	6298.918239358964
Nothing had ever suggested it before , but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter , than by supposing a partiality for their niece .	4781.223702718416
But , he added , you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them , with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here .	4227.822983492522
Is there one among the sex , who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman ?	5364.25998261942
At length , she spoke again .	7510.880940577033
and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement .	5415.800388911717
See <URL> Transcriber's note : Text enclosed by underscores is in italics ( italics ) .	6982.225423722116
I have just as much right to be asked as she has , and more too , for I am two years older .	4254.58284180211
he shook his head when I expressed my hopes , and said he feared W was not a man to be trusted .	5340.278315746951
My dear Lizzy , where can you have been walking to ?	5167.957583417349
After a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner , and thus began , In vain have I struggled .	5023.34436011486
But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault because I would not take the trouble of practising .	4984.829267801809
and , of course , I could not rest till I knew the particulars .	4811.9276823769715
That lady I suppose is your mother .	8583.498555397622
and on their being seated , a pause , awkward as such pauses must always be , succeeded for a few moments .	4591.630469346679
From the former .	13074.094725129657
There was one part especially , the opening of it , which I should dread your having the power of reading again .	4878.864413769321
They came .	13929.098001320865
and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed .	4195.356704209271
Wickham is safe .	13175.12320118363
and Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem .	5309.745510505697
Many stared .	19460.212283037825
