Average perplexity: 213.33627044787752
I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner .	76.89158909696545
and to him she had hardly courage to speak .	89.98617683720998
At that ball , while I had the honour of dancing with you , I was first made acquainted , by Sir William Lucas's accidental information , that Bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage .	11.38498516182416
My aunt Philips came to Longbourn on Tuesday , after my father went away ;	33.37364752009052
Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Robinson ;	42.65307947253131
I should take him , even on my slight acquaintance , to be an ill-tempered man .	33.76672966419316
The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret .	27.446690154369445
That is all very proper and civil , I am sure , said Bennet , and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman .	15.720304468393449
When I went away , I felt that it would soon happen .	52.12617344613035
and she felt capable under such circumstances , of endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters .	20.880622976404457
But that is not the case here .	141.9181008194894
Such I was , from eight to eight and twenty ;	57.38936235576912
and so extremely accomplished for her age !	102.27153306010464
or at least it was impossible not to try for information .	44.51261232657028
Nor I , I am sure , said Miss Bingley .	65.63132936814424
The day passed most pleasantly away ;	83.50680292983441
There has been many a one , I fancy , overcome in the same way .	39.32033579948398
It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week .	29.892520971534115
for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know , and read great books , and make extracts .	23.652597548740847
and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon , was such an instance of Lady Catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough .	13.06690140003528
She was quite amazed at her own discomposure ;	99.5861202159056
How abominable !	1574.7224801360653
After a few minutes reflection , however , she continued , I do remember his boasting one day , at Netherfield , of the implacability of his resentments , of his having an unforgiving temper .	13.240353642554728
Elizabeth again , and more seriously assured her of its truth .	59.407755134518034
and the effort which the formation , and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read .	11.885995113665752
these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce ;	16.39622789785632
and I have enquired of every body too , who is likely to know .	39.680240467670586
Here was knowledge in which no one could partake ;	58.33258826218783
C below .	1571.4439182596846
The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents , about a twelvemonth ago , was now brought forward again .	14.053576326688214
but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine .	33.07404722121923
Since her being at Lambton , she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud ;	36.68071611378746
and oh !	1571.7549892245504
Did you see it ?	367.7513891012729
I must be in town next Saturday .	132.21082954403568
A lady's imagination is very rapid ;	114.7967180481638
They stood for some time without speaking a word ;	45.05256689004092
The morrow produced no abatement of Bennet's ill humour or ill health .	16.92456651978955
He had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them ;	37.61969821121236
She told the story however with great spirit among her friends ;	34.24300744467379
How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter !	73.69529679649537
If I had known as much this morning , I certainly would not have called on him .	32.87465896926601
The old lady is Jenkinson , who lives with them .	41.486307185129675
At least , therefore , I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies .	13.740812104111717
Bennet , in equal silence , was enjoying the scene .	65.33687552187351
That his two sisters and Darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough , and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable .	10.584547290826093
I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous elopement .	31.218171645795444
and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and forwarded , as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side .	14.597919782115099
and the beautiful pyramids of grapes , nectarines , and peaches , soon collected them round the table .	15.76071284532436
Transcriber's note : Spelling and hyphen changes have been made so that there is consistency within the book .	14.733891227496342
But I must tell you how it went off .	56.78108884890791
He bore it however with admirable calmness .	73.96969975736553
To be sure , you knew no actual good of me but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love .	15.566870087023869
Why should they try to influence him ?	76.59617526989538
His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others , as in his reproaches to myself .	14.06214385848843
and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own , it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance .	12.632760987703696
Elizabeth was not surprised at it , as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill .	28.27756923376972
that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation , than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance .	13.262882760633536
You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas .	54.55553326592952
People do not die of little trifling colds .	67.77686743487216
With all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it , am I wrong , my dearest Jane , in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many ?	9.237453498550508
And then we were so merry all the way home !	56.45614520697327
Indeed , Mama , you are mistaken , said Elizabeth , blushing for her mother .	33.81333401265965
I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat .	47.11765446263652
and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley .	10.798615066223114
No , indeed , I did not .	144.57961140953256
Darcy's letter , she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart .	33.87211067659892
I cannot think so very ill of Wickham .	83.18919741817037
he actually danced with her twice ;	140.37332723258194
and Jane more especially , who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself , had she been the culprit , was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure .	13.83271223818898
said Lydia stoutly , I am not afraid ;	86.91733658180371
and Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages .	17.518329819390008
Lizzy , why am I thus singled from my family , and blessed above them all !	25.60606711721703
though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present , because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character .	8.054754006455408
The idea of Collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther , and he continued : My reasons for marrying are , first , that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances ( like myself ) to set the example of matrimony in his parish .	5.205738554064102
Upon my word !	579.7825397229562
and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , she could , perhaps , believe , that remaining partiality for her , might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned .	9.757791517665073
Her favourite walk , and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine , was along the open grove which edged that side of the park , where there was a nice sheltered path , which no one seemed to value but herself , and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity .	7.236595442973393
I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear .	16.28657880453861
And what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail ?	25.43638260849931
Widely different was the effect of a second perusal .	73.80441651663664
We will know where we have gone we will recollect what we have seen .	25.860850005752457
Her fellow-travellers the next day , were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable .	23.076129931838274
And then when we came away it was such fun !	47.4250249957281
or rather he has not Wickham's countenance , for his features are perfectly good .	33.5564791740716
How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence , she could not imagine .	27.76048672562609
for at any rate , there seemed a gulf impassable between them .	28.598134374884985
and she told me that it was certain true .	69.4201549485554
His regard for her was quite imaginary ;	133.85231065157728
and for the last half year , nay , for a twelvemonth , she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity .	18.495795306430214
Her astonishment , however , was extreme ;	136.69647456849265
This is the estimation in which you hold me !	55.024003679282785
when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them , and Elizabeth , looking earnestly in her face , was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever .	13.178450672705683
In short , my dear aunt , I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy ;	25.02817918678897

What will become of me .	191.14610621148438
But do you always write such charming long letters to her , Darcy ?	29.55113303348614
But how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable ?	46.1260871431442
but checking himself , he added in a gayer tone , Is it in address that he improves ?	23.814055797775247
Professor Michael S Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone .	11.603169438367697
This account then is what he has received from Darcy .	50.64166102772211
They were interrupted by Miss Bennet , who came to fetch her mother's tea .	29.647584034502042
and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity .	65.39045782587422
she is not acting by design .	160.9350662822086
Jane was not happy .	465.11895619029855
Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers , and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed , or a really new muslin in a shop window , could recal them .	9.509345334057896
it gives such an elegance to misfortune !	82.47992957898829
Other schemes too came into her head .	79.33313276784294
I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister .	22.429412830043923
If I were as rich as Darcy , cried a young Lucas who came with his sisters , I should not care how proud I was .	13.8074499406699
I shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier .	28.860639331952623
though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm , at her lively , sportive , manner of talking to her brother .	13.65902957717369
1 .	4079.0161042043856
Yes , madam , said Bennet , delighted to speak to a lady Catherine .	37.70621696800032
Pray , what is your age ?	181.18416321421054
And one of my own daughters .	235.28653793104425

I have been most highly gratified indeed , my dear Such very superior dancing is not often seen .	20.82046701873403
If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of , the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time , for from the day of the invitation , to the day of the ball , there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once .	9.832528523254291
To this , Mary very gravely replied , Far be it from me , my dear sister , to depreciate such pleasures .	14.846103243837181
In the evening , soon after Bennet withdrew to the library , she saw Darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme .	12.833297822826149
She saw instantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage ;	31.433949512464757
Her answer was warmly in his favour .	82.14439087454925
Darcy made no answer , and seemed desirous of changing the subject .	35.37270488441057
How are they even to be discovered ?	128.9826142275359
She enquired after his sister , but could do no more .	60.64349270643128
she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined in company with him four times .	20.40385326886802
Are you much acquainted with Darcy ?	149.6844387803497
We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton .	30.52985052210969
My object then , replied Darcy , was to shew you , by every civility in my power , that I was not so mean as to resent the past ;	18.353263671827072
How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains !	27.999885204687256
I mean , that no man in his senses , would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a-year during my life , and fifty after I am gone .	11.394177969092732
You must not suspect me .	175.65600818360184
Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred , during their visit , as they returned , except what had particularly interested them both .	14.766061800058004
Who would have thought it !	280.7954547572272
I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment .	51.535708111270104
Our plain manner of living , our small rooms , and few domestics , and the little we see of the world , must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself ;	9.806741251790799
You dare not , you cannot deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of dividing them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind .	7.875367096024388
When they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ;	13.900670591404804
Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow .	91.03804225725055
In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion , with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode , and the improvements it was receiving , he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them ;	9.680180955870288
I will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away , and come back again .	11.778326747020476
Well , Lizzy , said Bennet one day , what is your opinion now of this sad business of Jane's ?	20.187833146092498
But I hope you will not mind it : it is all for Jane's sake , you know ;	20.56659204288038
and it is that which makes the wonder .	57.024828512228495
She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought ;	15.622243887548604
Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment , nor were the other ladies often absent ;	24.549547247149114
Darcy danced only once with Hurst and once with Miss Bingley , declined being introduced to any other lady , and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room , speaking occasionally to one of his own party .	9.091631763267673
and though his pride was hurt , he suffered in no other way .	26.514283864544996
The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master , who was coming down in a day or two , to shoot there for several weeks .	11.231029547919595
There is a lady , it seems , a Younge , who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what .	10.729131114768457
He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her ;	10.15696278371142
He had not been long seated before he complimented Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters , said he had heard much of their beauty , but that , in this instance , fame had fallen short of the truth ;	10.00914262003519
Miss Bingley was engrossed by Darcy , her sister scarcely less so ;	49.17712275578539
They will have nothing else to do .	116.10428449777915
In point of composition , said Mary , his letter does not seem defective .	36.06826094399184
he was lively and unreserved , danced every dance , was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield .	12.743048405555548
it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her .	26.881722391574904
That is his notion of christian forgiveness !	69.72652307287974
what hours of transport we shall spend !	85.80687726470094
Oh !	3082.833849588038
so much ease , with such perfect good breeding !	74.79651051037798
Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness .	18.384714318201897
It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night .	26.675822130068816
I cannot quite agree with you there .	99.7141471989897
it is just as he chooses .	201.7270555529522
I am not romantic you know .	110.92515096236097
Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed , a mixture of pride and impertinence ;	27.4764213489556
She was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself ;	32.17902600327417
But there are two things that I want very much to know : one is , how much money your uncle has laid down , to bring it about ;	13.925447366448838
but that is what a governess will prevent , and if I had known your mother , I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one .	13.188150857720505
There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention , while she added , When I said that he improved on acquaintance , I did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement , but that from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood .	6.88006772032076
Colonel Forster is a sensible man , and will keep her out of any real mischief ;	29.05260127435801
The reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as I have given above .	26.08523119010037
Both changed colour , one looked white , the other red .	41.467225883165426
It had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town ;	22.140296635895492
but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended ;	56.02194246848336
Darcy !	5589.360213402174
Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far ;	92.98289887898946
though it had not occurred to me before .	117.1657815858631
to own the truth , with Wickham !	144.2025902257784
Her hopes were answered ;	249.89591237722286
He was my godfather , and excessively attached to me .	51.89329804429117
Well , well , said he , do not make yourself unhappy .	40.68622560172895
This is quite shocking !	352.48625345789554
How hard it is in some cases to be believed !	67.32534624646652
and he was always the sweetest-tempered , most generous-hearted , boy in the world .	21.91992272131937
and after observing Collins for a few moments , he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh .	10.753029794617373

and depend upon it , you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this , as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire .	11.667638380820529
it must be so , while he retains the use of his reason .	42.48798246042214
Vain , ignorant , idle , and absolutely uncontrouled !	58.27215944239173
but Jane happened to look round , and happened to smile : it was decided .	31.925454641281583
And is it really true ?	184.05213252578588
The letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so .	29.84015606010343
Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters .	17.51073378809935
Collins !	6875.896600736549
Without a governess you must have been neglected .	89.85946503718071
Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening , but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine , and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time .	8.745931119772065

for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her .	23.264750922329856
after honestly telling her what she thought , she thus went on : You are too sensible a girl , Lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are warned against it ;	10.270730401516387
And so , Darcy did every thing ;	121.33562500402971

said he , smiling .	334.1326223863886
Gardiner did not write again , till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster ;	37.71610668825473
But before they heard again from Gardiner , a letter arrived for their father , from a different quarter , from Collins ;	18.606396575247796
how acutely did she now feel it .	82.47562478985589
cried Jane .	1787.082912144361
I never heard any thing so abominable .	90.98657212897625
It was at Sir William Lucas's , where a large party were assembled .	34.60537153073617
but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield , and leave the next generation to purchase .	9.20772486858986
Her father had most cruelly mortified her , by what he said of Darcy's indifference , and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that perhaps , instead of his seeing too little , she might have fancied too much .	10.762846648859062
and though feeling no reliance on her , could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved .	13.354962974972652
Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Bingley's name had been last mentioned between them ;	17.47838749785883
CHAPTER XVI .	1403.50908934543
Did you go by the village of Kympton ?	71.49892269195149
Bennet's expectations were fully answered .	138.97808149493613
Will you come and see me ?	153.9291443180866
1 .	4079.0161042043856
As she pronounced these words , Darcy changed colour ;	50.953063039766185
They all paint tables , cover skreens and net purses .	24.63597191638538
But now we may be silent .	169.99178660434495
After a short silence , the lady first spoke .	63.48507626251716
But here , by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister's absence , I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized .	12.491946363798265
Elizabeth obeyed , and running into her own room for her parasol , attended her noble guest down stairs .	20.05013744308749
For about three years I heard little of him ;	54.73324985664491
Has your governess left you ?	149.50040618044068
but I was over-ruled , as I always am .	74.29711142734462
The family were assembled in the breakfast room , to receive them .	59.90546406802294
and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion .	44.09539766388083
Unless the elder brother is very sickly , I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds .	19.161595012411173
If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him ;	18.04596365769421
but so we all were .	210.6160272892777
Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew , but he had never seen any thing but affability in her .	14.50057689488042
Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had , from the distress of the moment , been led to make Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister ;	15.442799258354471
Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter , that Charlotte , really rejoicing in the match , was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over .	11.774110594324334
You are to understand , Miss Bennet , that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose ;	17.375363288913125
She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs .	37.437502423519966
The farewell between herself and Wickham was perfectly friendly ;	54.28268263416421
I wonder , said he , at the next opportunity of speaking , whether he is likely to be in this country much longer .	20.952498336746125
She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance , Hurst and Miss Bingley .	24.314446949876054
And , if I may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your lady possesses .	8.820295206821292
it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours , which the discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable ;	18.452230748243153
Let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers .	18.115332021002107
In comparing her recollection of Pemberley , with the minute description which Wickham could give , and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor , she was delighting both him and herself .	7.964235381764753
He was growing quite inattentive to other people , and wholly engrossed by her .	26.46489922787043
I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Darcy .	23.86253589407975
She had better have stayed at home , cried Elizabeth ;	49.09892916934411
On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn , your uncle had a most unexpected visitor .	22.755842469418493
and , turning to Elizabeth , said , Miss Eliza Bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room .	16.480795108735915
It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both ;	39.939937864166886
Yes ;	4459.007412392422
The favour of your company has been much felt , I assure you .	39.632433728307106
We have heard nothing from town .	121.6502719550348
Really , Collins , cried Elizabeth with some warmth , you puzzle me exceedingly .	32.82801244330188
They are gone down to Newcastle , a place quite northward , it seems , and there they are to stay , I do not know how long .	15.224275658034367
Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather , which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Wickham ;	14.48405929807693
and , in short , as the time drew near , she would have been very sorry for any delay .	24.191674456152278
But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation , she made no answer .	24.78033729419724
Perhaps we might be deceived .	256.26066360966814
the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father ;	17.64573334651622
Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there , that day ;	31.233525715229884
E9 .	5497.109814759492
One seems so forlorn without them .	83.3472270949567
I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever .	23.111151138633897
You need not send them word at Longbourn of my going , if you do not like it , for it will make the surprise the greater , when I write to them , and sign my name Lydia Wickham .	11.03926052269878
but he never distinguished her by any particular attention , and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourites .	8.164618616700755
Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure , and she was eagerly calling out , while her daughter read , Well , Jane , who is it from ?	17.673279679208957
I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more .	33.44350965610968
His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling .	151.103674252812
but now as the first shock is over , shall I own that I long for your return ?	21.99523289963804
My faults , according to this calculation , are heavy indeed !	30.836282227435657
You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for resisting every repetition of it .	12.593671094950915
She practises very constantly .	249.67315358084866
She had very little notice from any but him .	47.09862246076139
In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley , whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose .	23.92835108498201
but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at Hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of and Collins's happiness ;	8.338720135346655
Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all ;	40.454999976627754
Upon the whole , I am much pleased with him .	68.13139561079706
Collins , you must send a servant with them .	73.11463089398904
It is a grievous affair to my poor girls , you must confess .	32.46306268877584
and when the carriage drove up to the door , the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces , and displayed itself over their whole bodies , in a variety of capers and frisks , was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome .	8.020799223256414
It was impossible to imagine ;	207.16553645606567
That is very true , replied Elizabeth , and I could easily forgive his pride , if he had not mortified mine .	19.344519788996664
The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial , and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded , as having passed at the Netherfield ball , and as confirming all his first disapprobation , could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers .	8.813718082119214
If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room , I shall be very thankful ;	24.058295740750047
But in all , and in almost every line of each , there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style , and which , proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself , and kindly disposed towards every one , had been scarcely ever clouded .	8.955596688079352
I saw them the night before last .	79.32712701456973
With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes , did Lydia , assisted by Kitty's hints and additions , endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn .	8.137176277257533
Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ?	40.043266770386204
I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women .	25.562946925878997
She would be in nobody's way , you know , in that part of the house .	41.40450108701238
Oh !	3082.833849588038
and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother , and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance , particularly grateful to the daughter .	13.103039196378171
the turning past , he was immediately before them .	63.61757842933315
They had frequently been staying with her in town .	59.02408326855789
They will take care not to outrun their income .	55.46545681037694
These two girls had been above an hour in the place , happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner , watching the sentinel on guard , and dressing a sallad and cucumber .	7.951625945747065
How you must have hated me after that evening ?	52.858565025262166
She is all affability and condescension , and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over .	13.480214303082748
If she heard me , it was by good luck , for I am sure she did not listen .	26.89444623881119
He smiled , looked handsome , and said many pretty things .	40.38859969458115
The very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour , and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of .	11.154058000095874
By this time she is actually with them !	86.16394290924397
Not these two or three years perhaps .	79.40131873061172
and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable .	13.946559057280332
It amazes me , I confess ;	214.3112599814091
Miss Bennet , do you know who I am ?	118.52063487270922
As they walked home , Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen ;	22.6084810091257
Its business office is located at 8<DATE> West , Salt Lake City , UT 84116 , ( 801 ) 596-1887 .	7.142207391731379
and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably , when the sound of horses drew their notice , and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street .	8.814469272945123
Supposing him to be attached to me , would my refusing to accept his hand , make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ?	18.5913284376758
That had his actions been what Wickham represented them , so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world ;	11.67464679335289
Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent ;	29.87751082779844
Dining out , said Bennet , that is very unlucky .	83.58425885597114
Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a depravity , to which the separation of two young persons , whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison .	6.616452337545795
Charlotte tried to console her .	217.13966473225597
one meets it every where .	160.6101614074498
they are even impartial towards Miss King .	77.30310170370595
You shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very dreadful .	23.106066796498528
It may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement .	9.141327162315502
After lamenting it however at some length , she had the consolation of thinking that Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn , and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that , though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses .	8.885058326614008
For my part , I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody .	29.947034062544883
Mary , however , continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them .	19.52266675537444
I am always glad to get a young person well placed out .	31.351098413893748
She shook her head .	285.5178950449391
The park was very large , and contained great variety of ground .	42.97783498580367
what could she mean by it ?	153.16734312815703
Darcy may hug himself .	264.1083881191547
The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her .	70.44911304601847
and I am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not .	30.785868271103332
It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing , said Bingley .	43.30397012332845
Most willingly .	1615.5343476850212
But do not imagine that he is always here so often .	55.73830542707277
If you were sensible of your own good , you would not wish to quit the sphere , in which you have been brought up .	19.09938816834941
When I consider , she added , in a yet more agitated voice , that I might have prevented it !	22.354655709091965
The little Gardiners , attracted by the sight of a chaise , were standing on the steps of the house , as they entered the paddock ;	15.950091486119803
It keeps him in good humour , said she , and I am more obliged to you than I can express .	23.535578889638657
Say that urgent business calls us home immediately .	40.02213990563903
every body says that he is ate up with pride , and I dare say he had heard somehow that Long does not keep a carriage , and had come to the ball in a hack chaise .	12.83212819400382
But they did pass away , and and Gardiner , with their four children , did at length appear at Longbourn .	22.450450827087227
He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention .	35.42815415559777
Let me mend it for you .	115.60263808889297
Her heart had been but slightly touched , and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice , had fortune permitted it .	12.21467843954074
I do think Long is as good a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls , and not at all handsome : I like them prodigiously .	9.310549642423869
On his quitting the room , she sat down , unable to support herself , and looking so miserably ill , that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her , or to refrain from saying , in a tone of gentleness and commiseration , Let me call your maid .	8.175595006255923
1813 .	6847.919774710029
Upon this signal , the youngest of her daughters put herself forward .	38.38137568981347
Bennet had many grievances to relate , and much to complain of .	40.322790653719714
You take delight in vexing me .	95.23315049227858
For my part , Bingley , I always keep servants that can do their own work ;	22.70594402058911
Darcy , you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner .	25.097974968905593
He owed a good deal in the town , but his debts of honour were still more formidable .	25.998496580990857
Darcy's shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict , gave her a keener sense of her sister's sufferings .	16.779564953165636
They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her , and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her , So , Miss Eliza , I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham !	10.729099212205364
yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week .	40.024566361936515
I must have employment and society .	111.73063637638006
It would be nothing ;	426.5051066513269
and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room .	49.78705179716255
I should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me .	29.204872780512478
No , no , you shall not deceive me .	69.4641502259804
that to be in the same room , the same party with him for so many hours together , might be more than I could bear , and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself .	15.792673907582698
And then , said she , if that very improbable event should ever take place , I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself .	9.788790003660955
Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment ;	37.219205388512535
After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour , without hearing Miss Bingley's voice , Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family .	9.830421396992294
it had been written five days ago .	96.68365158630665
I do not know the particulars , but I know very well that Darcy is not in the least to blame , that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned , and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way .	9.388819083097708
Yes , very handsome .	352.88853599467575
my uncle !	2244.525549372801
But in such cases as these , a good memory is unpardonable .	35.75314091124892
Darcy !	5589.360213402174
Collins made his declaration in form .	94.0994705135285
Lady Catherine rose also , and they turned back .	72.49964136421833
My good opinion once lost is lost for ever .	36.770741364858786
Send back your answer as soon as you can , and be careful to write explicitly .	24.217716347865416
The feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation .	12.422436773733928
They found Mary , as usual , deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature ;	20.695999861513556
CHAPTER XXI .	1575.3856872474946
Their table was superlatively stupid .	135.57250934603672
Jane now came up .	291.9679194615311
She then took a large house in Edward-street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings .	16.617013943590496
CHAPTER XIX .	1311.7971600904
and now , my dear Jane , what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business ?	14.999708170107505
And what arts did he use to separate them ?	44.153562446393614
Mary and Kitty have been very kind , and would have shared in every fatigue , I am sure , but I did not think it right for either of them .	13.935984721822834
cried Elizabeth , with the greatest satisfaction .	142.37849722506212
Again his astonishment was obvious ;	161.6327113425584
Why did not you all learn ?	205.6351102048107
Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy , though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Bingley's regard , and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it .	11.420656431752914
He was then , he said , on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her .	31.108456861152906
It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single .	27.930527444597153
At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies , by not asking them to dance , and I spoke to him twice myself , without receiving an answer .	12.002694726194582
Your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man I know ;	22.274399355290754
As it was certain , however , that somebody was coming , Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion , and walk away with him into the shrubbery .	13.326401668671455
There can be no doubt of that .	125.17666048865257
and besides all this , she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking , the tone of her voice , her address and expressions , or the word will be but half deserved .	10.189051611130461
Good bye .	1418.4086473461753
Bingley arrived .	1576.9430817528764
Yes that is what makes it amusing .	77.57039852650236
yes ;	6968.999854754867
I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me ;	39.63655194779674
and from her correspondence with her sister , there was still less to be learnt for her letters to Kitty , though rather longer , were much too full of lines under the words to be made public .	12.070576255894558
but the latter half , which was dated a day later , and written in evident agitation , gave more important intelligence .	13.253379707208197
He knows where we live .	170.3670817962401
and , among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army .	14.037669713713239
In truth I must acknowledge that , with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage , I should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion , while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings .	10.59767354234874
You do not blame me , however , for refusing him ?	64.46479431612602
for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion , I should at present detest his very name , and wish him all manner of evil .	10.444684604526042
and from the observation of the day altogether , she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented .	31.638117807963592
I do not wish to avoid the walk .	84.56751455538075
What pin-money , what jewels , what carriages you will have !	46.61024401902196
Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl , and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose .	18.051304816592044
She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Forster , and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton , where the temptations must be greater than at home .	8.284894810998294
but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others , and she had no opportunity of detaining them .	19.995329765524218
All Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away ;	51.58508770798936
I described , and enforced them earnestly .	107.59006792544051
for , of course , they were to have a son .	72.7607287855046
But is it certain , absolutely certain ?	97.68680736855823
Mr .	6847.919774710029
CHAPTER XVII .	1311.7971600904
She was not equal , however , to much conversation , and when Miss Bingley left them together , could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with .	12.611118847402643
so I will dictate , and you write for me .	78.10411403039222
The surprise of such an application was great indeed ;	61.28598227999314
but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much .	40.30180829381027
He has been accused of many faults at different times ;	34.86287091110623
Have you had any flirting ?	250.41108326063943
and luckily for the others , the business of love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company .	26.358524890697744
What shall we do with him ?	189.39696522044736
First , that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion ;	32.072431386347915
and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , I hope , acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Wickham .	12.34681133016187
For your sake , turning to Charlotte , I am glad of it ;	34.28666255087692
Design !	6847.919774710029
She is a very good kind of girl , I believe .	55.39371922069675
Every savage can dance .	254.4686498931796
At length , every idea seemed to fail him ;	53.269000422855
Oh !	3082.833849588038
END OF VOL .	562.3223053690325
F5 .	6847.919774710029
I have heard , indeed , that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two .	22.51370814489148
I will only say farther , that from what passed that evening , my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me before , to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection .	10.289679147846064
Catherine , weak-spirited , irritable , and completely under Lydia's guidance , had been always affronted by their advice ;	17.041266977404405
The moral will be perfectly fair .	137.33513850674365
and she lay awake two whole hours , endeavouring to make them out .	22.755567069340998
F3 , this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' , WITH NO OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND , EXPRESS OR IMPLIED , INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE .	4.159895210697941
Let me advise you then , my dear Sir , to console yourself as much as possible , to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever , and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence .	9.120342896825786
how would she have behaved ?	171.42850413466394
There , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard .	16.561229354842375
She could think of nothing but of Wickham , and of what he had told her , all the way home ;	30.826347375465318
There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley , that could provoke his ridicule , or disgust him into silence ;	13.17923109957368
and the possibility of her deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret .	25.028845398667798
Her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely recollected her interest in the affair , and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth , seemed to have fixed them on her more , and more cheerfully .	10.063438741894696
It does not necessarily follow that a deep , intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours .	9.77898750758455
His sense of her inferiority of its being a degradation of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination , were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding , but was very unlikely to recommend his suit .	8.097932203486101
and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged , as by no means unpleasing , though it could not be exactly defined .	15.865373442932233
or at least , by the predominance of virtue , atone for those casual errors , under which she would endeavour to class , what Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance .	7.931602520307046
Colonel Fitzwilliam , who led the way , was about thirty , not handsome , but in person and address most truly the gentleman .	15.49030470027105
and till the morrow , their going was deferred .	46.52419091106907
Anxious and uneasy , the period which passed in the drawing-room , before the gentlemen came , was wearisome and dull to a degree , that almost made her uncivil .	14.993714221128233
I have nothing to say against him ;	109.99998113331458
She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged .	26.624698499582628
Gardiner was surprised and concerned ;	170.81065831214121
They are my old friends .	137.763562396279
And that I suppose is one of your sisters .	93.75737559555964
My mother means well ;	257.7784418390576
I shall like it of all things .	131.40271107811768
I do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to .	10.444242790715027
Have a little compassion on my nerves .	104.40614072867473
And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman , Ma'am ?	53.90305864851878
It was not all settled before Monday : as soon as it was , the express was sent off to Longbourn .	16.57228309594692
Their manners are not equal to his .	152.64117462755615
His behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire .	18.239286107534017
CHAPTER IV .	1311.7971600904
It is done , however , and it was done for the best .	62.20244980883851
and all that I can hope in this case is , that she is deceived herself .	30.114459158811904
and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate .	30.160556977582768
and with a more smiling solemnity replied , It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably .	14.150542930049287
But Jane could think with certainty on only one point , that Bingley , if he had been imposed on , would have much to suffer when the affair became public .	13.87197963931996
She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind .	22.271355325406983
It is a nice long walk , and Darcy has never seen the view .	32.19106502734453
our authority was too good .	193.483043275077
Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the good will of Hurst and Miss Bingley ;	26.28031484216706
He has many friends , and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing .	15.080153543078092
She talked on , therefore , without interruption from any of them till they were joined by Collins , who entered with an air more stately than usual , and on perceiving whom , she said to the girls , Now , I do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your tongues , and let Collins and me have a little conversation together .	9.174093457569894
that was impossible ;	1060.5071034510192
It cannot be concealed from any one .	102.10430188714727
Denny addressed them directly , and entreated permission to introduce his friend , Wickham , who had returned with him the day before from town , and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps .	10.388369748600645
but perhaps you would like to read it .	98.89798150583125
Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance .	38.09259432620442
Oh !	3082.833849588038
said Jane faintly smiling , You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , I could not hesitate .	18.555495540677843
They were soon gone again , rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise , and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Bennet's civilities .	8.191863733800163
She held out her hand ;	165.8770767563842
the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door , and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual .	14.201993942933528
Bennet protested against any description of finery .	68.37287747720569
and pride has often been his best friend .	63.41430849933544
Elizabeth related to Jane the next day , what had passed between Wickham and herself .	26.537927368064253
When the tea-things were removed , and the card tables placed , the ladies all rose , and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him , when all her views were overthrown , by seeing him fall a victim to her mother's rapacity for whist players , and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party .	8.105440447827956
They were to be off as soon as possible .	85.44001076522704
I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life .	34.41676499477501
Others of the party were now applied to .	109.41770690748177
I will leave him to himself .	152.89134304322516
How good it was in you , my dear Bennet !	78.67862538948042
in half a minute the letter was unfolded again , and collecting herself as well as she could , she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham , and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence .	9.775956862041816
When the engagement was for home , some of the officers always made part of it , of which officers Wickham was sure to be one ;	15.063085934213191
till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante .	16.12931965614088
E6 .	6847.919774710029
Bennet invited him to dine with them ;	129.68500597767766
You need not distress yourself .	170.90436105595862
and he was more communicative , and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him .	30.472862922640072
What do you mean , Bennet , by talking in this way ?	44.94717252241487
A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features , but he said not a word , and Elizabeth , though blaming herself for her own weakness , could not go on .	14.12549809331831
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement , the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law .	7.384773074720236
In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name ;	40.90346462435936
Elizabeth took up some needlework , and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion .	16.18112892171094
His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive ;	42.8528556185555
With great energy ;	550.9983706232383
there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day .	49.37014453307055
Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ;	15.340250466398889
She is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and I have no opinion of her .	34.03306560521634
Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit , and threw back the praise on her sister's warm affection .	16.960068036193423
My visit was not long , as Caroline and Hurst were going out .	36.44138380822944
They will never be distressed for money .	80.24814298945535
for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial .	41.67292480862886
True .	6162.734186746455
your feelings , I know , will bestow it unwillingly , but I demand it of your justice .	28.7421668622789
I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one ;	38.79909792611089
My dear Jane , Collins is a conceited , pompous , narrow-minded , silly man ;	17.501654079275774
If he does not come to me , then , said she , I shall give him up for ever .	22.48499586322454
I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his ill-treatment ;	24.78539243066001
Well , now let us be quite comfortable and snug , and talk and laugh all the way home .	17.282261806971132
and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world .	27.24574429774278

Sir William had been delighted with him .	138.4761444154222
and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair .	38.00942797735857
said Gardiner .	1989.943157832582
The business was therefore soon settled .	114.8819646782072
and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated , I felt no doubt of their happiness together .	19.903853747632326
and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings .	49.1389985688641
but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention .	48.67649036007938
She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there , and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you .	19.238504272346674
that I had been with you , you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone .	30.420474701990045
but , with many expressions of concern , he confessed himself engaged elsewhere .	32.29645682968007
Wickham had received his commission before he left London , and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight .	19.602388601925345
I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn .	23.33827994395088
My objections to the marriage were not merely those , which I last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside , in my own case ;	11.760621561316551
Sure he will not leave London before he has found them .	49.25926947020473
Her aunt assured her that she was ;	128.78920521048448
How it could occur a second time therefore was very odd !	34.42818706464283
it was evident that he was very much in love with her .	53.37914708512838
I know we dine with four and twenty families .	42.62889671853261
He still loves me , and we are engaged .	85.78630986782554
and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers .	18.847833604159717
Bingley of course returned with him to dinner ;	113.07119981119136
Its completion depended on others .	149.37624384480523
It pains me to offend you .	127.85142109056376
And if I had not a letter to write myself , I might sit by you , and admire the evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did .	16.588522616736327
though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible , I instantly resolved on setting off for this place , that I might make my sentiments known to you .	14.00655238142981
His apparent partiality had subsided , his attentions were over , he was the admirer of some one else .	16.443651159765476
but for your sakes , we would do any thing .	54.8288284138918
This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife ;	26.402015700180616
I who knew what he was .	180.3692574020542
All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes .	42.62168536659928
There I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it ;	44.139991115094
That will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable ;	34.223255390028704
Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ;	41.80403754044688
He did every thing best in the world ;	83.56985209431535
Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these , what would have been her sensations ?	13.027360342193179
Bennet and Kitty walked off , and as soon as they were gone Collins began .	29.057677205308455
Not that I have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body .	33.731136307314294
Miss Bingley told me , said Jane , that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance .	21.190419451330744
she was dying to know what could be his meaning and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him ?	19.887262726766657
I wish I might take this for a compliment ;	73.17005052814909
My father and Maria are to come to me in March , added Charlotte , and I hope you will consent to be of the party .	18.136577812402095
I saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it ;	21.072812090191555
We were always good friends ;	176.03065226686584
The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature , must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance ;	10.148330314535189
This was praise , of all others most extraordinary , most opposite to her ideas .	27.403988310871803
The Gardiners staid only one night at Longbourn , and set off the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement .	13.770206026272419
She was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia , and , removed from the influence of Lydia's example , she became , by proper attention and management , less irritable , less ignorant , and less insipid .	9.863772152392718
My dear father , I congratulate you .	136.20119399851436
and turning round , he looked for a moment at Elizabeth , till catching her eye , he withdrew his own and coldly said , She is tolerable ;	14.445266182143369
He does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from Darcy more than once , but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only .	12.995800154403653
He made her an offer in this very room , and she refused him .	33.472303878325306
Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase , and listened with all her heart ;	44.15498567959493
It was some time , however , before a smile could be extorted from Jane .	30.265833935699117
Sometimes one officer , sometimes another had been her favourite , as their attentions raised them in her opinion .	19.87924934155016
and , therefore , abruptly changing the conversation , talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage .	12.99192398860485
My uncle and aunt and I were to go together ;	69.10580138733549

for on first hearing it , Bennet sat quite still , and unable to utter a syllable .	23.012590971812624
I never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter .	24.20906088993521

for Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law , that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion .	11.05903619569936
] PRIDE AND PREJUDICE : A Novel .	64.22202490878124
You will not , I hope , consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family , my dear Madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter's favour , without having paid yourself and Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf .	6.600674437689071
I have been used to consider poetry as the food of love , said Darcy .	30.63909511873191
She had never heard of his having had any relations , except a father and mother , both of whom had been dead many years .	15.378824740860033
Or in other words , you are determined to have him .	55.220742621318706
and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again , when Bingley , who as well as the other had sat down , suddenly rose , and whispering a few words to her sister , ran out of the room .	11.992967294126263
and secondly , of my room .	179.77901633082584

A little .	1497.0270014960322
On the contrary , there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks .	22.618056052186358
and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly , and live in so rational a manner , as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten .	11.575060043080585

It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected .	20.475755573771508
and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day .	21.49008157859908
Well , all I know is , that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him .	20.77248991515287
And what claims has Lydia , what attractions has she beyond youth , health , and good humour , that could make him for her sake , forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well ?	8.944587441476452
May I ask to what these questions tend ?	56.61443158297212
They walked on , without knowing in what direction .	68.62395150951608
CHAPTER VII .	1311.7971600904
It was a fortnight since Bennet had been down stairs , but on this happy day , she again took her seat at the head of her table , and in spirits oppressively high .	14.201245829725517
She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on which there could be no difference of sentiment .	13.80465688418756
then some time or other we shall be happy to hear you .	45.210483083492115
causes which , though still existing , and existing to an equal degree in both instances , I had myself endeavoured to forget , because they were not immediately before me .	10.701179875204048
And can you likewise declare , that there is no foundation for it ?	33.27640581687214
I knew it myself , as it was known to Miss Bingley , but her brother is even yet ignorant of it .	23.187187967582993
As long as she stays there , it is all very well .	47.33423281982976
No arguments shall be wanting on my part , that can alleviate so severe a misfortune ;	20.44057593746034
No I cannot talk of books in a ball-room ;	76.34152178215194
I mention it , because it is the living which I ought to have had .	47.35393674602264
I write without any intention of paining you , or humbling myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , cannot be too soon forgotten ;	12.885486815356327
and her calling here was prodigiously civil !	70.10378182519385
She danced next with an officer , and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham , and of hearing that he was universally liked .	18.58032774489357
A thorough , determined dislike of me a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy .	15.664938551934021
Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister , who joined her with a cheerful look , which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors , than Elizabeth .	12.338576048984631
Which do you mean ?	350.1724563646497
Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in Section 4 , Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation .	6.83879291322694
But before she had been three minutes in her own room , her mother followed her .	38.61087411561432
And when you have given your ball , she added , I shall insist on their giving one also .	21.145703770831748
If you received the work on a physical medium , you must return the medium with your written explanation .	14.035584248841186
We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us , said Gardiner , but perhaps to the Lakes .	21.95561121282007
But the case is this .	230.52197535926723
1 .	4079.0161042043856
I believe her to be both in a great degree , replied Wickham ;	50.191277090253344
I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow , in comparison with myself , I should not pay him half so much deference .	14.708895662781245
And do you really love him quite well enough ?	58.99756327014004
He has heartily forgiven me now .	89.91667530952954
Yes , indeed , cried Bennet , offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood .	24.258956571349138
My aunt told me so herself on Saturday .	72.34806777326078
As it principally concerns yourself , you ought to know its contents .	39.66942035252238
You are not going to introduce yourself to Darcy ?	72.88407939302238
Something very much to the purpose of course .	116.13803612679042
The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family .	34.049019486908875
She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither ;	35.79116510279193
I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place .	17.92688441416823
but he saw only the father .	114.11591365882988
It would be dreadful !	414.7730056867551
Everything wore a happier aspect .	157.67450597397237
their minds were more vacant than their sisters' , and when nothing better offered , a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening ;	7.812260742388145
I told you so from the first , you may remember .	67.03390336941006
The gentlemen did approach ;	272.2849899004317
They had not been long together , before Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her ;	21.597660237564074
But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was .	32.965493971494816
and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another , might be remarked , he meant to make enquiries at Clapham .	10.62786794906006
Were it known to the rest of my family , I should not have merely my own gratitude to express .	26.52225679550676
If it was to be secret , said Jane , say not another word on the subject .	27.623613273925173
The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn ;	86.23104054646416
and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying there too .	10.701258906752834
she could not but say , after a moment's deliberation , I am not .	40.560897804973806
and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her , she dared not pronounce .	22.66777700508906
and what is to divide them ?	150.51493520774693
The two youngest of the family , Catherine and Lydia , were particularly frequent in these attentions ;	21.559437895570188
I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least .	23.000414331032808
I London : Printed for T Egerton , Military Library , Whitehall .	15.799634959726475
for , what with her board and pocket allowance , and the continual presents in money , which passed to her , through her mother's hands , Lydia's expences had been very little within that sum .	9.649884704917554
Dearest Lizzy , I hardly know what I would write , but I have bad news for you , and it cannot be delayed .	23.60855842181637
It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ;	31.404132589951814
No , not at all .	215.94403863871437
You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking , and thinking for your approbation alone .	17.27199688518771
Come as soon as you can on the receipt of this .	56.61416106051798
he introduced us to his sister .	148.60443137891752
Aye because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield , and he could not help answering her ;	22.360961668249136
Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth : My dearest Lizzy , I FIND myself very unwell this morning , which , I suppose , is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday .	7.82265033865009
and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome , discontented or too poor , she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences , silence their complaints , and scold them into harmony and plenty .	6.4708127144803855
but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear .	44.978401107207304
Lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how much he will give her .	26.527291259338583
Elizabeth was delighted .	658.0288796454997
The wish of procuring her regard , which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire , could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this .	12.582476910638032
But it is always so .	268.3826881089358
I did not know before , that I had two daughters on the brink of matrimony .	26.381739929631387
And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment .	9.367996978881779
but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled , and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with .	11.945971636633505
But so we all do .	173.2887392115069
May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment , or are the result of previous study ?	13.975926188509524
But he is , beyond all comparison , the most agreeable man I ever saw and if he becomes really attached to me I believe it will be better that he should not .	12.835893625255961
how shall I bear so much happiness !	102.62490951463528
She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia , with anxious parade , walk up to her mother's right hand , and hear her say to her eldest sister , Ah !	13.867224815083704
They were natural and just .	165.6812666111009
Denny and Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Philips's house , and then made their bows , in spite of Miss Lydia's pressing entreaties that they would come in , and even in spite of Philips' throwing up the parlour window , and loudly seconding the invitation .	8.212456769197587
and if she accepted any refreshment , seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family .	8.764973398843853
He did not talk to me of his own arts , said Fitzwilliam smiling .	38.69303466619431
Pray do not talk of that odious man .	99.18097591261575
It is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half-hour's acquaintance , as to a real , strong attachment .	16.26946848921419
F 1 .	1577.1027865035487
every body had been most kind and attentive to him , there had been no formality , no stiffness , he had soon felt acquainted with all the room ;	17.34054592867029
Let me first see how he behaves , said she ;	44.05612422216194
and I should have gone so all the way , if Kitty had not been sick ;	30.074007988606624
but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time , she had the same story to repeat every day .	20.64635855883253
Your daughter Elizabeth , it is presumed , will not long bear the name of Bennet , after her elder sister has resigned it , and the chosen partner of her fate , may be reasonably looked up to , as one of the most illustrious personages in this land .	9.44314328793342
I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this , and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time , without being informed that she was very accomplished .	12.342387155264971
On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared ;	18.613470611358125
72 of La Belle Assemblee 1 st July 1815 ] PRIDE PREJUDICE .	16.497816059255197
In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty , who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments , to make their appearance before .	12.533810764801604
Lakes , mountains , and rivers , shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations ;	25.27929798452302
But surely , said she , I may enter his county with impunity , and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me .	11.35463715935113
He took the hint , and when Mary had finished her second song , said aloud , That will do extremely well , child .	12.975181291478444
and when we got to the George , I do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too .	9.743663709050404
Do not you , Darcy ?	357.94189193304493
The garden in which stands my humble abode , is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park , her ladyship's residence .	12.521708960769836
I shall go distracted .	292.4571505049551
If you were aware , said Elizabeth , of the very great disadvantage to us all , which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded and imprudent manner ;	13.86549870655396
Elizabeth was disgusted , and even Miss Bennet was shocked .	67.6118146700247
You both did as much as you could , in planning the marriage .	35.68394048908059
And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate ;	20.099598557993495
There's for you !	753.915112537888
my dear , continued Bennet , I am quite delighted with him .	49.56222433400002
Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding ;	39.56669464932457
Elizabeth made no objection ;	386.6900827263589
did you admire me for my impertinence ?	111.5044920453811
The officers may not be so pleasant in General 's regiment .	34.2340190316449
By this time , my dearest sister , you have received my hurried letter ;	33.58212223765683
But not before they went to Brighton ?	124.22392223158764
When that business was over , he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for the indulgence of some music .	27.621836079971438
How much of good or evil must be done by him !	46.347811481428856
only in different lines .	272.1779347250187
Elizabeth , who had a letter to write , went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea ;	19.447027358324835
I think she will .	419.71877461545637
It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane , said she .	37.7627645094613
Miss Bingley offered her the carriage , and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it , when Jane testified such concern in parting with her , that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present .	8.96058666347963
Did Darcy give you his reasons for this interference ?	49.46131042388486
her uncle and aunt stopped also , and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building , the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road , which led behind it to the stables .	11.581432825905367
She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others ;	41.685517862003934
I cannot make him out .	219.3390367767512
Then , observed Elizabeth , you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman .	22.855543455640476
but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me , was a strong inducement .	25.79901791229534
She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her , but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea ;	16.285336365061127
and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society , and from our connection with Rosings , the frequent means of varying the humble home scene , I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome .	7.383549441236976
and he might imagine , from my father's behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that he would do as little , and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter .	11.770609032779273
The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage , explained to her that , by his wife at least , if not by himself , such a hope was cherished .	14.344531041994813
It ought to be so ;	298.4265616053543
Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane .	44.03724684380949
that proud and repulsive as were his manners , she had never , in the whole course of their acquaintance , an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together , and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways , seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits .	6.473351953144604
Do you talk by rule then , while you are dancing ?	46.22939283417311
Oh , lord !	504.8360273960898
But , alas !	551.7353789720029
Your ladyship wants Darcy to marry your daughter ;	66.17253320040841
CHAPTER IX .	1311.7971600904
but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way .	29.007000564579815
It may do very well for the others , replied Bingley ;	54.98382236148828
and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke , joined to the circumstance itself , and many of the circumstances of the preceding day , opened to them a new idea on the business .	15.630572549427765
or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ?	39.24691778742958
Had I been in love , I could not have been more wretchedly blind .	42.41322853561727
But still he would be her husband .	140.36442830079912
He had found the law a most unprofitable study , and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained , if I would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for , and I could not have forgotten my revered father's intentions .	8.313190825902726
I must have my share in the conversation , if you are speaking of music .	40.07839756833861
but her sister's was involved in it , as she thought he must be sensible himself .	31.06943585037359
They shook hands with great cordiality ;	121.96036197166391
Do not charge a fee for access to , viewing , displaying , performing , copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works unless you comply with paragraph 1 .	6.989160122455395
and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance , of his having ten thousand a year .	17.62588402449953
There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer ;	46.082977633598055
and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him , as now , when all love must be vain .	18.52008346011677
Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants .	43.27050308468465
The marriage of a daughter , which had been the first object of her wishes , since Jane was sixteen , was now on the point of accomplishment , and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials , fine muslins , new carriages , and servants .	9.232128422615567
nor could she think , without a smile , of what her ladyship's indignation would have been .	29.72272126104864
and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out .	13.332059165624832
Every thing being settled between them , Darcy's next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in Gracechurch-street the evening before I came home .	11.59510123443541
In as short a time as Collins's long speeches would allow , every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both ;	14.708828884798576
But do not be cast down .	172.31421545654186
I was so vexed to see him stand up with her ;	49.204547690604
She is grown so brown and coarse !	55.7498578906629
I am very , very sorry .	133.81514238375857
He now wished it more than ever .	108.98855164513157
and in farther justification of Darcy , she could not but allow that Bingley , when questioned by Jane , had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair ;	14.130348291988097
The time fixed for the beginning of their Northern tour was now fast approaching ;	26.585562321914836
But what , said she , after a pause , can have been his motive ?	30.679934690794244
they are married !	799.4111026522293
cried Elizabeth , I am excessively diverted .	129.11613139293482
Could there be finer symptoms ?	159.2172989645982
The possibility of his having really endured such unkindness , was enough to interest all her tender feelings ;	18.18610659143439
he was moving that way ;	218.2662872785983
but with a moment's recollection and a returning smile , replied , that he had formerly seen him often ;	25.822065711877123
And what am I to do on the occasion ?	65.05885643906345
You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns , said Darcy in a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour .	17.131348362555194
I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction , and nobody but a governess can give it .	12.22971430145185
Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth .	65.856665347024
I expected you to stay two months .	94.64596771680293
Well , but now for my news : it is about dear Wickham ;	38.91395014441723
It was a journey of only twenty-four miles , and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch-street by noon .	16.125580550883793
They have both , said she , been deceived , I dare say , in some way or other , of which we can form no idea .	14.8688552256854
Nor was her respect for him , though it made her more quiet , at all likely to make her more elegant .	22.601421696137457
she cried .	1471.656537186322
Collins moreover adds , I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad business has been so well hushed up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place , should be so generally known .	8.555270466036282
and , as he spoke , he left the room , fatigued with the raptures of his wife .	30.099033580896034
He cannot afford it .	249.90350890542646
and after relating the circumstances , she thus went on : I am now convinced , my dear aunt , that I have never been much in love ;	13.452971104106448
I knew that Wickham ought not to be a clergyman .	59.93166954493946
And they are really to be married !	154.58520654364264
A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other , and out of their three months' acquaintance they had been intimate two .	11.7090225149047
Your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as I said before , they had a great deal of talk together .	20.521230438653184
a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure and affection and intelligence , which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad .	5.8786930289024335
Elizabeth went away with her head full of him .	93.07232564808216
and she was perpetually either making some inquiry , or looking at his page .	24.401301233707724
But the horror of what might possibly happen , almost took from me my faculties .	17.041868831148527
At any rate , she cannot grow many degrees worse , without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life .	12.53599697339946
Can you deny that you have done it ?	89.04037855256429
Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother's .	74.90230326934315
You could not have started a more happy idea , since you will not take comfort in mine .	17.322082549645682
No more have I , said Bennet ;	102.36047336616961
Jane was by no means better .	129.73254792802604
Why , at that rate , you will have been here only six weeks .	39.5400168415547
I had not an idea of it .	146.22017894392403
I never saw such a woman .	177.04640205946546
Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid , who continued , though slowly , to mend ;	21.95238651908057
In nine cases out of ten , a woman had better shew more affection than she feels .	19.048177154401316
Elizabeth would wonder , and probably would blame her ;	61.034617184587105
The present unhappy state of the family , rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary ;	23.619304909804594
Darcy took her place by her niece , and they walked on together .	37.87576854518795
But from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed , respecting each circumstance , I shall hope to be in future secured , when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read .	8.138263139184174
and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning .	31.315289860580513
but shortly recovering himself , advanced towards the party , and spoke to Elizabeth , if not in terms of perfect composure , at least of perfect civility .	16.443589776150695
I know it all ;	357.26544780303607
La !	5497.109814759492
I know of nobody that is coming I am sure , unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in , and I hope my dinners are good enough for her .	10.40229608257968
You must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm works .	7.7662671655147895
Elizabeth could not but be pleased , could not but triumph .	43.45541511664811
In spite of this amendment , however , she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn , desiring her mother to visit Jane , and form her own judgment of her situation .	14.60716809474032
is not this an agreeable surprise ?	156.49300085812692
He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be , and unconsciously closed his book .	14.866501388278703
But we considered it , we talked of it as impossible .	66.08057202070609
I can hardly write for laughing .	115.22122957615375
Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment , before their approach was announced by the door-bell , and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room .	10.506560761376635
Her aunt now called her to look at a picture .	52.70870203626539
CHAPTER XI .	1403.50908934543
Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Bennet .	28.84115013452568
Come be quick , be quick !	123.53635117888808
She could neither wonder nor condemn , but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom , afforded no palliation of her distress .	10.874612907022682
Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh , said Elizabeth .	40.74947650440579
Five daughters successively entered the world , but yet the son was to come ;	34.35955116645022
I do not know when I have been more shocked , said she .	34.59308937866747
Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object .	109.7160675752182
I know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you ;	18.96358154623233
Your attendance upon her , has been too much for you .	62.83840568662998
I am sick of Bingley , cried his wife .	71.60611501239138
How can you be so silly , cried her mother , as to think of such a thing , in all this dirt !	22.052350310668093
That is a failing indeed !	196.9508363593196
The Foundation makes no representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United States .	11.340334228983282
but that Charlotte could encourage him , seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself , and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum , and she could not help crying out , Engaged to Collins !	8.516878854927516
Had they been only ten minutes sooner , they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination , for it was plain that he was that moment arrived , that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage .	10.886257654623572
Do not be afraid of my running into any excess , of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will .	15.369094455518923
Certainly , Sir ;	680.4701743443061
Elizabeth , feeling really anxious , was determined to go to her , though the carriage was not to be had ;	31.020152201539293
or in other words , to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more .	15.62312331739578
I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that .	31.029857028331755
Sir William only smiled .	322.59075839324777
and his son will be just like him just as affable to the poor .	33.01845752272719
She seems a very pleasant young woman , said Bingley .	57.138726263391895
but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature , as the compliment deserved .	18.995025027262592
but I am an idle fellow , and though I have not many , I have more than I ever look into .	25.13301150618574
Now I am quite happy , said she , for you will be as happy as myself .	31.298721568089082
but amongst other causes of disquiet , she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour ;	15.957725899181826
It was a large , handsome , stone building , standing well on rising ground , and backed by a ridge of high woody hills ;	9.563395876285512
she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion , five and twenty years ago .	16.3900302460993
it was a better sized room , and had a pleasanter aspect ;	47.7971678921225
Do not you know that Collins wants to marry Lizzy ?	54.77603018979529
You are uniformly charming !	256.1717454006756
org Section 4 .	606.3020616030311
Elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them .	13.25871479894761
We have reason to imagine that his aunt , lady Catherine de Bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye .	17.14560999269785
For what do we live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ?	18.214882491713237
but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley .	98.47614608844978
Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display ;	36.4363272606521
When I have a house of my own , I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library .	27.521439489499713
But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away ;	31.74393735776258
but respecting his abilities , and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself , she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook , and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which , in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children , was so highly reprehensible .	8.95731731714078
She read , with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension , and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes .	9.969924663656585
To Gardiner , Wickham had one means of affording pleasure , unconnected with his general powers .	22.23729679219243
It is not of peculiar , but of general evils , which I am now complaining .	26.978886069471656
and I am happy to say , there will be some little money , even when all his debts are discharged , to settle on my niece , in addition to her own fortune .	12.640499152866752
This is the consequence you see , Madam , of marrying a daughter , said Elizabeth .	27.364823833512496
and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday , could have made such a Friday , Saturday , Sunday and Monday , endurable to Kitty and Lydia .	9.647758704737775
On reaching the house , they were shewn through the hall into the saloon , whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer .	11.125270911195662
Wickham only shook his head .	154.67277612450906
where else can they be so well concealed ?	72.26036799094612
This roused a general astonishment ;	157.9183450309191
said she .	1724.8475078893864
and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be as well to be silent .	12.227607000707797
But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you , who is very pretty , and I dare say , very agreeable .	20.37526127847233
but when questioned by him Denny denied knowing any thing of their plan , and would not give his real opinion about it .	14.861060450211381
When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure , she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment .	17.500489235384297
He must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to live on .	24.577485248196844
and that his character was by no means so faulty , nor Wickham's so amiable , as they had been considered in Hertfordshire .	16.163059520609952
Till I have your disposition , your goodness , I never can have your happiness .	36.648166777258595
I do not like to boast of my own child , but to be sure , Jane one does not often see any body better looking .	15.207687175492808
and when they next met , he looked at her only to criticise .	36.88386801988047
Were it for nothing but his love of you , I must always have esteemed him ;	28.598337279592194
his formal civility was just what it had been , and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family .	11.227540764843777
and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents .	56.90701398083465
but , alas !	558.2703419354731
This invaluable friend was a very young woman , and very lately married .	40.93700117191357
Of whom does Jane ever think ill ?	68.63123071930488
The faces of both , however , were tolerably calm ;	52.88152216922157
I am only ashamed of his asking so little .	74.3408311880171
F3 .	7079.122622599643
Your uncle !	1577.1027865035487
but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme .	91.7233629844343
I never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses .	24.694688070771065
I told my sister Philips so the other day .	54.01099607015944
It is useless to talk of it .	86.80989369341795
If we thought alike of Miss Bingley , replied Jane , your representation of all this , might make me quite easy .	19.04059217992952
and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give the praise where it was due .	8.630442062622745
Did not you ?	817.1418129890392
It must be an amusing study .	131.57901895730262
and after a short silence Bennet began repeating her thanks to Bingley for his kindness to Jane , with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy .	9.062205013560101
He is the kind of man , indeed , to whom I should never dare refuse any thing , which he condescended to ask .	19.836205404362754
that abominable Darcy !	557.4832165567352
What an excellent father you have , girls , said she , when the door was shut .	24.213289123023017
Does she live near you , sir ?	89.84310824763979
I see no occasion for that .	116.6305091000172
Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty , but she smiled too much .	38.816479397477984
She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable .	17.652981518877706
but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood , and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess .	12.974375296104753
and when he did speak , it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety , not a pleasure to himself .	12.044901160280032
but on the third , her repining was over , and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once , on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere .	13.778924622100089
and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds .	12.910662499485815
Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you , and wants him to marry Miss Darcy .	26.868748128775845
and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice .	11.234038038556866
With them he is remarkably agreeable .	122.77431129794256
I never met with anybody who delighted me so much .	37.45748361599772
CHAPTER VII .	1311.7971600904
Why must their marriage be private ?	102.2905213595884
I speak nothing but the truth .	194.0654893739381
The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart ;	38.281244199030326
If Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin , why is not he to make another choice ?	14.422910496538265
Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight , when she should enter the room .	37.58690877884934
In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society .	22.80884208888217
cried Elizabeth .	1373.851020902062
and what with the Philipses , the Lucases , and the officers , there was not a day without its engagement .	22.96939882704114
I am sorry you think so ;	139.70779450386115
There are a few things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works even without complying with the full terms of this agreement .	12.795364887920227
On that head , therefore , I shall be uniformly silent ;	44.91790941876421
and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust , naturally inclined my father to be of service to him , and on George Wickham , who was his god-son , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed .	11.056233271991127
You persist , then , in supposing his sisters influence him .	42.618421805792806
The surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great ;	27.894491977656262
Ten thousand a year , and very likely more !	67.69978589561626
It was first broken by Annesley , a genteel , agreeable-looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse , proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others ;	9.155566654008174
Lady Catherine observed , after dinner , that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits , and immediately accounting for it herself , by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon , she added , But if that is the case , you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer .	10.755964215977986
His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention , the first to listen and to pity , the first to be admired ;	13.446513518447604
I cannot but wonder , however , at her having any such fears now , because , if he had at all cared about me , we must have met long , long ago .	13.142903256246894
What will Wickham say ?	258.8866822703597
Elizabeth , though she did not credit above half of what was said , believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister's ruin still more certain ;	14.367479455119577
And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice ?	56.39180984962963
Another time , Lizzy , said her mother , I would not dance with him , if I were you .	28.180583572365027
She had ventured only one glance at Darcy .	59.04522216469088
My dear Lizzy , they must have passed within ten miles of us .	35.07882591810777
His affection for her soon sunk into indifference ;	62.47778813661829
but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty .	51.77170811465519
Kitty simpered and smiled , and hoped her turn was coming soon .	32.514627199035594
and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another , and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be .	15.029155070556317
What did Colonel Forster say ?	195.13342788643482
and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths , quite mistake the matter .	10.675022122162865
But to expose the former faults of any person , without knowing what their present feelings were , seemed unjustifiable .	15.872720812391888
Not so much as I could wish , Sir ;	73.92161181318204
Both sisters were uncomfortable enough .	168.90382545206177
she cried .	1471.656537186322
Pray do , my dear Miss Lucas , she added in a melancholy tone , for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me , I am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves .	10.0482230076549
With no expectation of pleasure , but with the strongest curiosity , Elizabeth opened the letter , and to her still increasing wonder , perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper , written quite through , in a very close hand .	7.913374853803692
Ever since I have known it , I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it .	21.706265353980356
Nobody can tell what I suffer !	147.51420155662097
Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister ;	52.37980602617243
Very much .	1599.7904307171495
I do not deserve it .	159.6463731830069
Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman , and he was thinking of her with some complacency , when thus accosted by Miss Bingley , I can guess the subject of your reverie .	16.759846353892335
He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room .	13.476738927796836
On finding Bennet , Elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words , May I hope , Madam , for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth , when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ?	9.915657277136198
Kitty and me were to spend the day there , and Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening ;	26.410317087564174
Darcy bowed .	1574.6682309829173
but her spirits returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be duped , by the sister at least .	20.01898362182146
Where shall you change horses ?	137.6820944515971
We all love to instruct , though we can teach only what is not worth knowing .	21.542120895661157
They attacked him in various ways ;	118.16840819899814
That he should even speak to her was amazing !	70.75101647390903
He was struggling for the appearance of composure , and would not open his lips , till he believed himself to have attained it .	14.045465574990537
She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight , and was certain of a willing listener in Jane , whenever she might wish to talk again of either .	11.627039250902172
The tumult of her mind was now painfully great .	72.72553576255301
Oh , yes !	522.7852403671635
and the respect which he felt for her high rank , and his veneration for her as his patroness , mingling with a very good opinion of himself , of his authority as a clergyman , and his rights as a rector , made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness , self-importance and humility .	7.730049500308032
But , perhaps his sister does as well for the present , and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her .	15.666479636548686
but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to .	40.84573117361145
The first week of their return was soon gone .	61.3394260423344
It mortifies me .	550.5265273048424
Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood ;	29.84883327019721
I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more about it , and to ask when Denny comes back from town .	14.682384074651718
but if that be the case , there can at least be no want of subject .	25.642787676242534
It must have been his sister's doing .	109.83658771244787
and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning .	19.002888861851588
Collins's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter , to whom they could give little fortune ;	17.462795864285017
but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish .	13.882941538939873
and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship's carriage was ready to take them all home .	18.56657115477276
The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent , had made a great difference in the country , and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees .	14.496738388011169
But you are not entitled to know mine ;	91.17830390915125
cried Elizabeth .	1373.851020902062
Jane looked at her doubtingly .	201.8052818227041
E9 .	5497.109814759492
The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished ;	63.88803998932217
Had she found Jane in any apparent danger , Bennet would have been very miserable ;	25.150606066530305
These are home questions and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature .	17.65675041876897
And if not able to please himself in the arrangement , he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice .	21.724052296962864
In the first place , replied Gardiner , there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland .	20.450605230233407
In Three Volumes .	470.00017296925205
More thoughtfulness , and less anxiety to please than when they last met , were plainly expressed .	21.943754898426068
His former acquaintance had been numerous ;	149.4110798426676
There was no one therefore who could be pointed out , as likely to give any news of him .	22.364808213404668
' Allow me , by the way , to observe , my fair cousin , that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer .	12.345839947430443
It has been most unconsciously done , however , and I hope will be of short duration .	29.132883724431416
and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood .	89.79616941297287
Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings , and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them .	22.84473541557493
Other books were produced , and after some deliberation he chose Fordyce's Sermons .	26.535000830887526
He found her as handsome as she had been last year ;	57.15473681239607
and it was certain , that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one , whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his weakest side .	10.309311337870593
Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory .	56.16137932218082
But here he was set right by Bennet , who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook , and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen .	12.810957788668272
Her character will be fixed , and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous .	17.602891127471775
Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole Park , but feared it might be beyond a walk .	21.722522156022528
and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins , the excellence of its cookery was owing .	21.48505899915304
She was now in an irritation as violent from delight , as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation .	13.949195558583229
She was immediately told , that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence ;	16.773397193580344
Bingley and Jane , however , soon allowed the others to outstrip them .	33.76877573973387

If you mean Darcy , cried her brother , he may go to bed , if he chuses , before it begins but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing ;	14.82255381582668
No , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems likely to rain ;	19.78868415775416
but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given , to remind her of her post .	12.393538492490086
They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching ;	9.828763940469218
but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went , for neither Lydia nor Collins were once silent .	13.88597735246808
no .	6081.1008001417185
yes I understand you perfectly .	159.2172989645982
On applying to see the place , they were admitted into the hall ;	45.33243556960793
You know how I detest it , unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner .	33.341929189614014
he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it .	17.99657245197289
It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side ;	26.963256582476927
it came from Netherfield , and the servant waited for an answer .	42.99441038390206
Four weeks passed away , and Jane saw nothing of him .	59.2258516925646
but in vain .	627.4486365690341
Darcy replied with great intrepidity , Miss Elizabeth Bennet .	60.30176867850012
The gentleman experienced some change of feeling ;	72.750405579573
I was obliged to confess one thing , which for a time , and not unjustly , offended him .	23.272666029529837
After many pauses and many trials of other subjects , Elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first , and saying , I am astonished at his intimacy with Bingley !	12.230138543074537
Darcy took up a book ;	182.8673551617159
When she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ;	35.56265316624085
I felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in marriage , because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right .	15.472487115094491
To this speech Bingley made no answer ;	70.69682403212624
A young man , such as you describe Bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks , and when accident separates them , so easily forgets her , that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent .	10.910465531882721
I hope at least he has not deceived us .	68.10148548977413
and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit .	15.024684955665293
but that it was no worse , she had need to be thankful .	55.67477051468035
but no one was less likely than Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life .	14.564921140119223
You are very ill .	393.12532973070984
Lady Catherine's great attentions to Collins you have been a daily witness of ;	32.6685121459487
Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter , and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again .	14.416747574602296
Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Bennet and the children .	30.278644741424213
Elizabeth was again deep in thought , and after a time exclaimed , To treat in such a manner , the god-son , the friend , the favourite of his father !	15.769193746203348
and she dwelt with energy on his many merits , as they proceeded together up the great staircase .	15.584069307461027
About a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in London ;	25.749240369892075
They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse ;	28.040316805857795
It was reasonable , however , to hope , that they would not continue long .	36.93805055066879
I am exceedingly gratified , said Bingley , by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper .	15.81967271340106
Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed ?	38.28732562010024
So , he enquired who she was , and got introduced , and asked her for the two next .	35.85706250137023
The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed , except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention .	14.666938539083539
Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory ;	72.68653250148675
Not that I shall though , she added to herself , as she finished the letter ;	39.241038066363075
a sense of very great ill usage , and most painful regrets at his being what he is .	26.20378558791983
My motive for cautioning you , is as follows .	69.54191214848574
He acknowledged the truth of it all ;	111.19442766557736
But little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there .	19.358203059034107
one I will not mention ;	331.3591925936646
A scheme of which every part promises delight , can never be successful ;	28.079827790174093
See <FILENAME> or <FILENAME> : ( <URL> ) or ( <URL> ) Images of the original pages are available through Internet Archive .	8.913406629749927
She did not fear her father's opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means , that she , his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her , was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till Darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile .	7.793209924835276
and after laughing at her some time , allowed her at last to go saying , as she quitted the room , If any young men come for Mary or Kitty , send them in , for I am quite at leisure .	10.935748645027004
and fearful , on the contrary , as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long , she urged Jane to borrow Bingley's carriage immediately , and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned , and the request made .	7.695255174799434
She looked at Jane , and smiled , and shook her head by turns .	38.24442556309135
Yes , and her petticoat ;	339.4355201635643
I would go and see her , if I could have the carriage .	58.61841525120669
How was that possible ?	305.6851004356441
It was over at last however .	147.71459657497425
avoiding Bennet as much as possible , saying not much to Elizabeth , and nothing at all to the others .	27.078597862955057
here comes Hill .	549.1421248858585
This was invitation enough .	254.13344830117418
' She did indeed .	314.6762816935119
Lady Catherine listened to half a song , and then talked , as before , to her other nephew ;	26.70455131409869
But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought , and think only of what will make me happy , your affection , and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt .	12.92415337064482
Their powers of conversation were considerable .	104.4610702667462
Miss Bingley , said he , has given me credit for more than can be .	28.63471224616881
We know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode .	36.83474682372833
At such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth , though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband .	9.875331080300034
To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love ;	30.428241149369462
for who would object to such a partner ?	107.23588570252436
He placed himself by her .	185.35731242262926
You know my mother's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends .	25.81268926002087
Excuse my interference .	549.1421248858585
That she should receive an offer of marriage from Darcy !	39.99185933527295
But Elizabeth had now recollected herself , and making a strong effort for it , was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished her all imaginable happiness .	10.541512908907208
The hall , the dining-room , and all its furniture were examined and praised ;	29.14452754153149
I will sit in my library , in my night cap and powdering gown , and give as much trouble as I can , or , perhaps , I may defer it , till Kitty runs away .	12.304474282660623
But it ended in nothing , and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again .	20.31131050819098
Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over , and , though determined not to slacken as a correspondent , it was for the sake of what had been , rather than what was .	10.312054692312744
There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same , but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh , I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters .	11.434348647727825
She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest , but Jane with all possible mildness declined interfering ;	23.249539206020952
She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte's observation , and hurried her away to her room .	9.942270881788335
But you forget , mama , said Elizabeth , that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that Long has promised to introduce him .	14.926357944836273
Wickham indeed had gone to her , on their first arrival in London , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her .	13.023467511161176
Have you never happened to see her there ?	70.75297347775987
Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane , while she was ill at Netherfield ?	23.42884044946252
Oh !	3082.833849588038
Conjectures as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her brain ;	23.50989940912776
She answered with equal indifference and brevity , and the other said no more .	26.38954046756281
I dislike it very much , he replied ;	81.28195223822063
For herself she was humbled ;	254.1306251206801
It certainly is a most iniquitous affair , said Bennet , and nothing can clear Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn .	15.635038486641253
Why any fear of detection ?	171.06077516887925
Bennet all amazement , though flattered by having a guest of such high importance , received her with the utmost politeness .	15.222386154224104
cried he , with an air of awkward gallantry ;	59.873795329374886
cried Lydia .	1520.9687570215838
About a month ago I received this letter , and about a fortnight ago I answered it , for I thought it a case of some delicacy , and requiring early attention .	11.698325452676041
They were within twenty yards of each other , and so abrupt was his appearance , that it was impossible to avoid his sight .	13.00840052633609
When this information was given , and they had all taken their seats , Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire , and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment , that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings ;	7.92717157576505
To Catherine and Lydia , neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting .	19.7963030799315
He listened to her with perfect indifference , while she chose to entertain herself in this manner , and as his composure convinced her that all was safe , her wit flowed long .	12.077564193147085
It is something to think of , and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions .	27.771642903665292
This son was to join in cutting off the entail , as soon as he should be of age , and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for .	9.148350138179813
there is nothing marked in its lines .	100.22358532351248
and in her air altogether , there is a self-sufficiency without fashion , which is intolerable .	25.051209664408994
I do not pretend to regret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire , except your society , my dearest friend ;	16.113332040105313
Her astonishment , as she reflected on what had passed , was increased by every review of it .	19.315271516574214
she times them ill .	254.504214376956
Darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as Gracechurch Street , but he would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities , were he once to enter it ;	8.086654104022191
CHAPTER XVII .	1311.7971600904
Not yet , replied Jane .	245.08745593153617
but I do not know when that will be .	77.29530028549725
The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucas's last week ;	22.334013332757074
She expressed her gratitude again , but it was too painful a subject to each , to be dwelt on farther .	20.0378417425591
Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical .	58.13552621428615
Here , leading the way through every walk and cross walk , and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for , every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind .	5.393182603113456
Elizabeth could hardly help smiling , as she assured her that had not been the case .	32.39948323861734
though , when the letters were read , Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen .	17.860229370070375
and you , yourself , when last at Longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man , who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him .	11.906589417600834
and Collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment ;	12.633080835419323
Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount , and Elizabeth silently consented .	25.08294421918369
And what sort of young lady is she ?	77.41904348127572
She was engaged one day as she walked , in re-perusing Jane's last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by Darcy , she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her .	6.854243116683661
It would have spared her , she thought , one sleepless night out of two .	32.1611140644284
who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself .	11.77233646010701
to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think , than such as did not .	18.187777321296615
But your arts and allurements may , in a moment of infatuation , have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family .	12.547882889175968
This unfortunate affair will , I fear , prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day .	16.539783238229813
It convinced her , that accident only could discover to Bingley her sister's being in town .	22.709682093186576
He had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research ;	15.089402946992074
E9 .	5497.109814759492
I am afraid , Darcy , observed Miss Bingley , in a half whisper , that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes .	11.793681786247094
On this point she was soon satisfied ;	131.03329042241108
He began to wish to know more of her , and as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others .	21.112707447837067
The compliment to herself and her sister , was not unfelt .	69.54925422193298
You must not blame my aunt .	135.3023154248398
has she any family ?	312.2432589949106
She was very wrong in singling me out as she did ;	43.3377575643532
Yet , indeed , I am in earnest .	106.13833785503616
I am sure you must feel it so .	89.10497736636769
You are charmingly group'd , and appear to uncommon advantage .	48.84523584167055
Let us hope for better things .	84.01114661901285
Charlotte's first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness ;	43.3159900928572
give a loose to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you cannot greatly err .	9.453134881041596
it was melancholy to leave her to such society !	72.42827320540961
Bennet , accompanied by her two youngest girls , reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast .	28.02718912466359
always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body !	34.775592671042595
And in the wretched state of his own finances , there was a very powerful motive for secrecy , in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia's relations , for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him , to a very considerable amount .	9.168280261906089
Her heart was divided between concern for her sister , and resentment against all the others .	27.99160876303311
I am sure I know none so handsome ;	65.7342582969329
Were the whole arrangement complete , my disappointment would be certain .	49.50805294042636
its object was nothing less , than to secure her from any return of Collins's addresses , by engaging them towards herself .	13.0029192049761
Catherine was disconcerted , and made no answer ;	94.11359605204527
Elizabeth was surprised , however , that Wickham should consent to such a scheme , and , had she consulted only her own inclination , any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes .	13.998186470324889
But she is too much like her brother , very , very proud .	41.6091684630514
His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party ;	23.401753541832402
Not yet , however , in spite of her disappointment in her husband , did Bennet give up the point .	23.76288510476915
Colonel Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity , proved that he was generally different , which her own knowledge of him could not have told her ;	18.161799689756226
CHAPTER XVI .	1403.50908934543
We are not on friendly terms , and it always gives me pain to meet him , but I have no reason for avoiding him but what I might proclaim to all the world ;	12.333184415242597
I have not seen her for many years , but I very well remember that I never liked her , and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent .	14.8598161403861
I am perfectly serious in my refusal .	90.20913186472613
You may well be surprised , Miss Bennet , at such an assertion , after seeing , as you probably might , the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday .	12.340725601560994
But it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations , and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for her , for a woman who had already refused him , as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham .	7.9555905526176245
no wonder if they love her better .	74.87533450756649
He could be still amiable , still pleasing , to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town ;	30.947264746275557
It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long expectations .	22.594061489200424
I perfectly comprehend your feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been .	31.185499418237484
The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits , in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share .	10.801986148279864
From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach , and with many speeches of thankfulness on Collins's side , and as many bows on Sir William's , they departed .	10.273012235835346
The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world , though only a few weeks before , when Lydia had first run away , they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune .	10.370400491784908
The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse , or covering a skreen .	9.837645833622553
Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia ;	140.0938572519943
As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night ;	12.97237153871704
Elizabeth , however , had never been blind to the impropriety of her father's behaviour as a husband .	32.724513903209434
The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic .	28.11503616868891
Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton .	70.01650563943896
and in their brother's manners there was something better than politeness ;	41.36208669772004
Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight .	35.640572110858
Yes the late Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift .	26.80128223238174
Lady Lucas herself has often said so , and envied me Jane's beauty .	30.06589140682407
We will go round the Park every day .	61.175411744476044
What would she have said ?	192.6624995619141
Of Collins and Lizzy .	352.6412652067921
and his civilities were worn out like his information .	42.28668501323385
Three daughters married !	620.8541606628318
but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just ;	16.77806852499646
One does not know what to think .	130.766613997837
She resolved to give her the information herself , and therefore charged Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner , to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family .	12.324737273227377
I have heard much of your master's fine person , said Gardiner , looking at the picture ;	27.182829129701584
They may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more exceptionable purpose .	30.213867181303552
Elizabeth could not refuse , though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit .	37.04289474885793
But every body is to judge for themselves , and the Lucases are very good sort of girls , I assure you .	22.298155768493675
And as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses , to buy them , after they are married .	12.4051836298327
I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular , but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish .	11.71991896826402
She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her , must be the work of her brother , and without looking farther , it was satisfactory ;	17.144640240178635
advised her to return to bed , and promised her some draughts .	46.05194470984217
His regiment is there ;	310.8681479582583
END OF THE SECOND VOLUME .	145.9868378536923
Stay , stay , I will go myself .	94.43593728823251
did not I mention it to you ?	176.27929193359938
Elizabeth privately added , And how much I shall have to conceal .	44.14189460598627
And with these words he hastily left the room , and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house .	11.731632666994585
This match , to which you have the presumption to aspire , can never take place .	25.338327419378317
Exceedingly well .	1579.418931050181
But he paid her not the smallest attention , till her grandfather's death made her mistress of this fortune .	15.832051689694117
and yet there have been things enough happened in the time .	52.69062336435688
Without allowing herself time for consideration , and scarcely knowing what she felt , Elizabeth on finishing this letter , instantly seized the other , and opening it with the utmost impatience , read as follows : it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first .	8.596056471637864
The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire , lest she should suffer from the change of room ;	13.05603858333251
I am glad it occurred to me to mention it ;	51.97094541320791
but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us , for she went up stairs half an hour ago .	14.613381062198432
CHAPTER XIII .	1311.7971600904
An easy distance do you call it ?	89.21840930713483
Lizzy , cried her mother , remember where you are , and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home .	17.93611521551069
and , to imitate his politeness , she began , as they met , to admire the beauty of the place ;	27.967946935664873
Then taking the disengaged arm of Darcy , she left Elizabeth to walk by herself .	25.36680839031179
But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general .	23.59961599992715
Nothing child , nothing .	434.08109925918944
It was possible , however , that some of his companions in the shire , might be able to give more information ;	22.69584533515816
Well , cried Elizabeth , have it as you choose .	80.12912296946763
but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him , her anger was turned against herself ;	16.0149051684303
Had it been your uncle's doing , I must and would have paid him ;	30.822604554462046
She assured him that no one intended to play , and the silence of the whole party on the subject , seemed to justify her .	18.315070897550118
She was shewn into the breakfast-parlour , where all but Jane were assembled , and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise .	13.073834507894999
and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away .	16.882278873727586
The observations of her uncle and aunt now began ;	61.15524529777597
Elizabeth made no answer ;	264.8654555956747
I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home , and see if I can make it up any better .	16.688967343523156
He must be an oddity , I think , said she .	63.37696944765501
How can you talk so ?	174.49789398107004
Has she been presented ?	329.21116513999453
There were some very strong objections against the lady , were Colonel Fitzwilliam's words , and these strong objections probably were , her having one uncle who was a country attorney , and another who was in business in London .	9.495248170644881
I shall see her again !	220.37388151465234
But her mind was so busily engaged , that she did not always know when she was silent .	28.962556509348907
though often standing within a very short distance of her , quite disengaged , he never came near enough to speak .	21.055044816469316
Yes , there was something in that ;	133.12111807186446
After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ;	15.028552492134004
Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention .	116.02056594827009
It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match .	20.889793053245977
Beyond a doubt , they do wish him to chuse Miss Darcy , replied Jane ;	33.42127134921164
But of course she did not mention my name to you .	49.634109016552934
But as no such delicacy restrained her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back , she should think herself very ill used .	8.623717951837794
Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts ;	36.39918879218167
If he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to Long .	41.555093850785745
' Those were your words .	151.47354198430207
It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life .	13.482018272246211
Her nose wants character ;	249.89591237722286
but depend upon it I will carry my point .	48.27657320402086
Gratitude , not merely for having once loved her , but for loving her still well enough , to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him , and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection .	8.938209828929574
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again , having still a great deal to say to her , and many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends .	12.47413443182945
Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves .	71.77777445563716
and in your heart , you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you .	19.314803674598842
Oh !	3082.833849588038
Yes , and I had heard it before .	120.36131233165078
As he said this , she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer .	28.34441612257487
Her colour changed , and she said no more .	79.94458534776604
Such formidable accounts of her Ladyship , and her manner of living , quite frightened Maria Lucas , who had been little used to company , and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings , with as much apprehension , as her father had done to his presentation at James's .	10.138583031261076
When they had gained their own room , Jane taking out the letter , said , This is from Caroline Bingley ;	21.360127911309153
Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest , and then , sick of this folly , took refuge in her own room , that she might think with freedom .	13.632097722036443
The rector of a parish has much to do .	64.65218809283523
You forced me into visiting him last year , and promised if I went to see him , he should marry one of my daughters .	18.960382774822335
She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors , she wanted to compose her own , and to make herself agreeable to all ;	20.590748482719764
Pardon me for interrupting you , Madam , cried Collins ;	53.94950034981504
;	62294.302831350775
Society has claims on us all ;	111.2034243167821
They were rather handsome , had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town , had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds , were in the habit of spending more than they ought , and of associating with people of rank ;	9.131442480900144
and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn .	28.626429672006978
After this day , Jane said no more of her indifference .	57.212988721879796
and now we are better .	216.7073116344466
Your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you .	24.53457288452658
There is some sense in what he says about the girls however ;	32.06613848307489
and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself .	43.42746943340559
Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me .	36.30114250813682
Lady Catherine herself says that in point of true beauty , Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex ;	16.616977447141835
thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together ;	61.876889844317375
Had I but explained some part of it only some part of what I learnt , to my own family !	21.679123112945668
Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue ;	25.298441427212648
I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love !	13.797118110906538
when we met at Pemberley .	209.20605527318315
My temper would perhaps be called resentful .	67.68606271977542
You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world .	23.99893564970331
I did not know that you intended to walk , said Miss Bingley , in some confusion , lest they had been overheard .	22.94135867570659
It was all over before I arrived ;	85.798297903934
cried Elizabeth , as soon as they were by themselves .	65.02009904178965
Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in .	115.02192849979654
wished his fair cousins health and happiness again , and promised their father another letter of thanks .	17.39374929445955
This was spoken jestingly , but it appeared to her so just a picture of Darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer ;	16.3351028696848
Miss Bingley , however , was incapable of disappointing Darcy in any thing , and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives .	17.440813474793348
Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded ;	23.24430674926789
He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins , from a conviction that if they saw him depart , they could not fail to conjecture his design , and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise ;	8.907945431543578
and she could not help remembering what Charlotte's opinion had always been .	25.765706437547635
CHAPTER XIV .	1311.7971600904
Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable .	56.90629348149206
In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended ;	26.959070660729875
Well , then , you need not be under any alarm .	50.6065858898509
I think she will be pleased with the hermitage .	91.1863956168687
Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error , and seek to clear one , without involving the other .	13.417416643603879
If they believed him attached to me , they would not try to part us ;	26.803899007709532
but he eluded the skill of them all ;	63.90996618876447
Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me .	55.19107634713976
And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen .	11.180111636348236
She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman ;	41.562213652002264
I am all astonishment .	312.9398979402907
The conversation soon turned upon fishing , and she heard Darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport .	7.18003380469481
Dearest Jane !	1615.5343476850212
The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy ;	41.41212714330751
And accordingly she did turn , and they walked towards the Parsonage together .	39.56996846714923
and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September , than any body else in the country .	15.90763081871888
I will make no promise of the kind .	104.24457268011945
But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was .	11.3682188727572
Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine , what is to befall her ?	21.2036050010687
I have been a selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle .	25.80789765487801
My dearest child , she cried , I can think of nothing else !	47.692783098519506
and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia , her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost importance , and till he entered the room , the misery of her impatience was severe .	12.618825832217231
Some acquaintance or other , my dear , I suppose ;	70.74465038002245
Oh !	3082.833849588038
The venison was roasted to a turn and everybody said , they never saw so fat a haunch .	15.965751359893892
Your picture may be very exact , Louisa , said Bingley ;	44.86615684252148
That he has neither integrity nor honour .	81.67808348284218
On and Gardiner's coming up , they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment ;	18.36965615939622
nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion .	24.617279083124643
and you cannot imagine how well he looked !	72.69323405915154
How he lived I know not .	126.65533212059246
She has two nieces of her own .	104.68149460639688
But tell me , what did you come down to Netherfield for ?	53.4802044467434
and when I am in town it is pretty much the same .	58.44359313166117
Many small donations ( $1 to $5 , 000 ) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS .	7.3214944894144605
Very well .	1447.564372327282
Oh !	3082.833849588038
It is of all subjects my delight .	94.11246359430815
I am sorry to hear that ;	145.36416448689204
and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of Lydia's leaving home .	21.75501599591936
A gentleman and a stranger !	236.645162183525
He sat with them above an hour , and was in remarkably good spirits .	29.775394332160293
Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia ;	20.347931975249363
what is the matter ?	595.8653292169076
The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia , depended less on any single event , or any particular person , for though they each , like Elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with Wickham , he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them , and a ball was at any rate , a ball .	7.405073263992222
Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ;	34.679347808372206
and pray tell her from me , that she cannot expect to excel , if she does not practise a great deal .	17.392169498188483
I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things .	29.50777298859982
They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room ;	57.152077900015904
nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family .	12.591711635328494
Is my father in town ?	258.8319819741858
If I could but see you as happy !	102.57056306134457
You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling , I am sure you did .	21.29301645129394
It was not till the afternoon , when he joined them at tea , that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject ;	19.116918088913785
Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves , vanity to what we would have others think of us .	19.041362142772126
Heaven forbid !	1399.997372406987
Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule ;	115.4356998149629
And of your infliction , cried Elizabeth with energy .	67.94233065116009
From what he said of Miss Darcy , I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , reserved , disagreeable girl .	18.679233901602288
Their other aunt also visited them frequently , and always , as she said , with the design of cheering and heartening them up , though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of Wickham's extravagance or irregularity , she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them .	6.167141386058373
Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday ?	70.46723541174833
Without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ;	17.340847209598884
I depend on you for that .	162.84091061721003
I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it ;	41.732818491485176
In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike , she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man's affection , and though her intentions did not vary for an instant , she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive ;	12.2997938978826
I can remember no symptom of affection on either side ;	36.402408338872696
Your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions ;	31.636379286958537
If you should have no objection to receive me into your house , I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family , Monday , November 18th , by four o'clock , and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se'night following , which I can do without any inconvenience , as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday , provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day .	5.593095437559129
She knew not how to support herself , and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour .	14.438012983279592
for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation .	9.09488561144266
Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Miss Bennet ;	26.253372252286937
She replied in the affirmative .	258.47250413493595
What is it you mean ?	187.8432991099458
You must feel it ;	368.6169875253952
Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play , she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer .	11.237920775488915
You must come and make Lizzy marry Collins , for she vows she will not have him , and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her .	12.715361843798735
replied her sister .	917.2990296057029
I might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little endeavour at civility , I am thus rejected .	18.20764575968396
I can easily believe it .	213.8129052703609
Jane , I take your place now , and you must go lower , because I am a married woman .	24.201648321174222
He took the hint , and soon began with , This seems a very comfortable house .	23.789055629232177
and from all Bingley's connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it , from that very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him , of their becoming hereafter her own .	11.380819110502161
Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have !	38.32451013925988
He did look at it and into it for half an hour , was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms , satisfied with what the owner said in its praise , and took it immediately .	11.046946457302123
It adds even another motive .	146.04285201576187
My good qualities are under your protection , and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible ;	19.57040283703234
Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable .	59.61153886062315
We can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough ;	24.156870050752303
too good for the waiter , is not it ?	86.72833867978994
but it had not been so in Derbyshire .	106.51094553126391
Elizabeth , to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this , heard it in silent indignation .	19.80131697188579
What sister would think herself at liberty to do it , unless there were something very objectionable ?	19.005791427635234
but no one looked more amused than Bennet himself , while his wife seriously commended Collins for having spoken so sensibly , and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas , that he was a remarkably clever , good kind of young man .	8.42775791885345
Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour , he had been able to get the better of himself .	23.6228886193767
The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident .	58.84817392607096
My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology .	39.8806756953344
You may depend upon it , Madam , said Miss Bingley , with cold civility , that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us .	12.9585014513908
They could have been understood only by her mother , who might have felt nearly the same .	31.051112162932643
I am sure I shall break mine , said Lydia .	53.58690632694447
His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary ;	19.58003188191376
What relates to yourself , is as follows .	93.50270997599766
dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter , which , in her ladyship's apprehension , peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance , in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew , which she had refused to give .	8.12229304372768
and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations .	44.98307817081615
I do not know .	285.85979196902514
To oblige you , I would try to believe almost any thing , but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this ;	18.96683345162604
There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them , for Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam , the younger son of his uncle , Lord and to the great surprise of all the party , when Collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him .	11.093759642361963
This is my advice .	330.00948114382027
There was also a postscript to this effect .	52.87401748259218
Though her manner varied however , her determination never did .	48.50600759089615
Good gracious !	1373.0350778783054
It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day .	16.052323937962345
Yes , I have had a letter from him by express .	57.576537408827406
I am perfectly convinced by it that Darcy has no defect .	38.78510654254189
but when he went away , the whole family returned to their usual employments , and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration , for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden , or in reading and writing , and looking out of window in his own book room , which fronted the road .	8.690940287355822
Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments .	137.88561137944228
Dear madam , cried Hill , in great astonishment , don't you know there is an express come for master from Gardiner ?	14.114896111362981
Gardiner added in his letter , that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day , which was Saturday .	23.8337829071248
and your wit and vivacity I think must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite .	11.230152718113729
only three miles .	669.4117483347201
Kitty , who took all these threats in a serious light , began to cry .	27.898347737633802
Two of her girls had been on the point of marriage , and after all there was nothing in it .	30.698919480220884
I am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection .	14.385710338973075
I fancy she was wanted about the mince pies .	57.5834969690919
You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy .	10.660218697131256
for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him , I should only think worse of her understanding , than I now do of her heart .	16.50208975867596
A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music , singing , drawing , dancing , and the modern languages , to deserve the word ;	12.733652376939581
We acted with the best intentions .	182.50429226216662
and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room .	49.80419324710674
there was good humour and kindness .	169.7022449187527
Elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him ;	41.41666147133373
Let me hear from you very soon .	82.80156197505681
and Collins , being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader , was extremely well pleased to close his large book , and go .	13.24607779113055
How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love ?	31.663897944883566
I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me .	22.145507002324173
my dear Bennet , as she entered the room , we have had a most delightful evening , a most excellent ball .	26.413464200724793
cried Bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , if that disagreeable Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley !	11.730729357995717
But we are none of us consistent ;	107.80631795735098
Bennet , who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him , continued her triumph .	24.923114967523876
condolence , insufferable .	549.1421248858585
With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content ;	76.46003824736114
Not at all .	568.6459700566107
Let me congratulate you , on a very important conquest .	72.73729721247379
and you must feel , as well as I do , that the woman who marries him , cannot have a proper way of thinking .	18.65782040629984
but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply .	51.66546742130236
My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness , and I confess that I did not expect to receive more than my due .	16.344828957116203
though when the first tumult of joy was over , she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while .	19.018553852689635
Lizzy declares she will not have Collins , and Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy .	32.48356262549081
The journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane ;	37.11460007626497
All were struck with the stranger's air , all wondered who he could be , and Kitty and Lydia , determined if possible to find out , led the way across the street , under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop , and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot .	6.080998662220354
Bingley was quite uncomfortable ;	389.3884508921268
He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper ;	63.66164501442916
There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law .	20.62763757073895
But Gardiner could not be seen , and Darcy found , on further enquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning .	15.796346321346606
The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news , and telling again what had been already written ;	15.954430457129005
No ;	5515.523422156578
I shall not go away , till you have given me the assurance I require .	31.29982868327386
but she checked herself .	269.18445562349217
Yet why did he come ?	179.8886343602793
and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls .	40.759266418332764
On the contrary every particular relative to his sister , was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself ;	20.28804241525545
If it be not so , let Darcy contradict it .	46.05070041380919
I guessed as much .	395.435575958524
But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person ;	30.28571336604561
This is a parade , cried he , which does one good ;	46.576357465682
My dear , replied her husband , I have two small favours to request .	32.62070313834908
cried he , turning towards her .	155.79573399662053
The walk being here less sheltered than on the other side , allowed them to see him before they met .	18.585237100678754
That among his own connections he was esteemed and valued that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling .	8.070156435246933
Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing ;	40.53361588864607
Lord !	6162.734186746466
They returned therefore in good spirits to Longbourn , the village where they lived , and of which they were the principal inhabitants .	22.16672326069076
But my father cannot .	375.129705976738
if , indeed , such a report is in existence .	62.14952899587826
and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in his regimentals .	19.00320797803543
The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw .	40.211263698062325
As a child , she was affectionate and pleasing , and extremely fond of me ;	31.549226552425385
Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house , and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane .	14.713802169078633
Poor Reynolds , she was always very fond of me .	58.23553479219636
I have certainly meant well through the whole affair .	59.727032536899934
Calling back the servant , therefore , she commissioned him , though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible , to fetch his master and mistress home , instantly .	8.982817665621925
And this is always the way with him , she added .	55.55360513541194
I wish I could say , for the sake of her family , that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children , produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible , amiable , well-informed woman for the rest of her life ;	9.565665258702829
But my feelings are not only cordial towards him ;	61.46198917754908
It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together , and yet for the advantage of some , conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible .	9.14974408403626
After walking two or three times along that part of the lane , she was tempted , by the pleasantness of the morning , to stop at the gates and look into the park .	12.308851009359541
Upon my honour , I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life , as I have this evening ;	20.639421792205397
Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the next day , and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Wickham , and give him an invitation also , if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening .	12.220766767239862
Unfeeling , selfish girl !	254.8221331647736
Darcy is engaged to my daughter .	163.0605031150803
I was told , that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married , but that you , that Miss Elizabeth Bennet , would , in all likelihood , be soon afterwards united to my nephew , my own nephew , Darcy .	13.701958249005932
she cried .	1471.656537186322
They owed the restoration of Lydia , her character , every thing to him .	37.06778037282344
and she could no more bear that Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first vehemence of her disapprobation .	17.880307000013634
and could she have included Jane in the scheme , every part of it would have been perfect .	34.67416787056741
You know not what you are about .	123.23055438964118
And upon Elizabeth's seeming really , with vexed and embarrassed looks , about to escape , she added , Lizzy , I insist upon your staying and hearing Collins .	9.249136673502598
sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man .	20.35755937032099
Your list of the common extent of accomplishments , said Darcy , has too much truth .	29.226357082669264
E7 .	6847.919774710029
how he must have felt it !	231.26654762735095
Not at all , he replied ;	185.59698243563074
But Jane knows , as well as I do , what Wickham really is .	32.14667953968505
To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire , when that conviction had been given , was scarcely the work of a moment .	17.71968892256723
La !	5497.109814759492
Of what he has particularly accused me I am ignorant ;	56.47914480642049
And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit ;	23.237170321986444
Its banks were neither formal , nor falsely adorned .	40.518289146164676
As for Elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia , that she considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter ;	14.497698334554812
It is unlucky , said she , after a short pause , that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country .	13.47756943877775
Not as you represent it .	196.42161709901023
I told you the other day , of his infamous behaviour to Darcy ;	51.98438809970979
And what is fifty miles of good road ?	71.75073105118501
till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk , she made some slight observation on the dance .	13.877376260030927
the compliment must be all for herself .	126.00364263626511
The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected .	40.58866154136486
I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out , if possible , from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment , whether Wickham has any relations or connections , who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself .	9.49366726985889
Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay , for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other .	13.736075585166555
You know not , you can scarcely conceive , how they have tortured me ;	24.484423103540188
A flirt too , in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation ;	39.584755627792894
and if I was her , I would not have put up with it .	48.866228782807866
They were confined for the evening at different tables , and she had nothing to hope , but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room , as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself .	12.406779411757393
PRIDE PREJUDICE .	1571.4439182596846
I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters , and beg leave to apologise for it , as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends , but of this hereafter .	10.28277925589853
but though Jane would have defended either or both , had they appeared to be wrong , she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister .	13.88286479028321
and affectionately taking her hand , said in reply , Do not make yourself uneasy , my love .	19.19038245138882
For heaven's sake , madam , speak lower .	56.88757553065141
when her father continued , You look conscious .	94.58753462324418
When I last saw her , she was not very promising .	58.31579408660556
They are wanted in the farm , Bennet , are not they ?	44.47524096840552
Elizabeth listened , wondered , doubted , and was impatient for more .	28.67534394009576
The part which I acted , is now to be explained .	57.6405010978594
Elizabeth longed to observe that Bingley had been a most delightful friend ;	47.87942272944175
How merry we shall be together when we meet !	58.15229757915627
When this was done , she had a less active part to play .	39.55258885585407
Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression .	190.19871532716633
She could think only of her letter .	127.10396252187644
but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger .	23.240782446918985
His own father did not long survive mine , and within half a year from these events , Wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally resolved against taking orders , he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be benefited .	7.683483412256153
I do not remember her name among the ladies at court .	33.09740772210649
and as Dawson does not object to the Barouche box , there will be very good room for one of you and indeed , if the weather should happen to be cool , I should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you large .	9.291421733866004
but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ;	32.712196619719634
That would be a good scheme , said Elizabeth , if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home .	22.19814182331537
though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Bingley in consequence of it , before they did .	19.40427286000517
This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared ;	43.28147635322653
Not that I am afraid of myself , but I dread other people's remarks .	32.841221743105024
for give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained .	8.089789561723922
And so , is it quite certain he is coming ?	66.1738043467117
London : Printed for T Egerton , Military Library , Whitehall .	18.98976343759161
Things are settled so oddly .	135.16552149551865
If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity .	7.676117564739506
It was greatly my wish that he should do so , he added , as soon as his marriage was fixed on .	17.86686506860084
You cannot be too much on your guard .	77.143694471097
I have said no such thing .	155.6207816126619
and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf , is natural and amiable .	15.39680878707266
But it is not merely this affair , she continued , on which my dislike is founded .	22.828094667570266
She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind ;	33.05353888393159
and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment .	31.750106680329576
But I make no doubt , they often talk of it between themselves .	31.983093894486846
and before she could strike into another path , she was overtaken by Wickham .	27.764385877137848
and sometimes did venture a short sentence , when there was least danger of its being heard .	23.18676180639638
I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ?	23.38932698793495
and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement , without the intention of marriage , she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey .	6.780003878403084
As that was the case , neither Jane , to whom I related the whole , nor I , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public ;	15.127515889859898
After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject , Bennet coolly observed , From all that I can collect by your manner of talking , you must be two of the silliest girls in the country .	9.811952737932637
They are in the same profession , you know ;	88.5861422537758
And I have another favour to ask .	109.29072727031648
She had not been many hours at home , before she found that the Brighton scheme , of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn , was under frequent discussion between her parents .	10.529777060482324
Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton , where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the King , during his mayoralty .	9.463354432586396
Anxiety on Jane's behalf , was another prevailing concern , and Darcy's explanation , by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion , heightened the sense of what Jane had lost .	11.449437586864986
But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends , will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ?	7.5828112430992585
The other is Miss De Bourgh .	109.67211054077534
how rich and how great you will be !	75.75079123364561
And have you heard from him often ?	98.19003290379608
In the absence of Jane , he always attached himself to Elizabeth , for the pleasure of talking of her ;	28.66817613690345
What am I to do ?	220.23930545241848
Engraved for No .	549.1421248858585
Elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint , being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply .	15.313848290353443
That they might have met without ill consequence , is perhaps probable ;	33.233996207938716
But I can guess how it was ;	121.24547936912982
But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else .	13.960304407305767
but neither that , nor any thing else , awakened a suspicion of the truth .	28.5752176159136
I hope there was .	492.66804296591897
1 .	4079.0161042043856
But , if I were you , I would stand by the nephew .	46.985207430213
Darcy walked off ;	607.3682081911903
The officer was the very Denny , concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire , and he bowed as they passed .	13.699464795547971
But here , she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character , for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness , and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet .	9.868215030194554
Had Lydia's marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms , it was not to be supposed that Darcy would connect himself with a family , where to every other objection would now be added , an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned .	7.843810888515771
No , no , let me shift for myself ;	53.22050582062058
I am impatient to see him .	143.19371826446374
The carriage was sent to meet them at , and they were to return in it , by dinner-time .	29.652073758192685
For forty years , he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support .	13.125734842737854
but Elizabeth heard not a word , and , wholly engrossed by her own feelings , followed them in silence .	22.202601433975996
hang Kitty !	1571.4439182596846
And my mother How is she ?	107.41579497861929
From his garden , Collins would have led them round his two meadows , but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost , turned back ;	8.515205125280184
She is happy , then , said her father , drily ;	51.352470487735495
I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing !	47.34447714619608
I wonder when you would have spoken , if I had not asked you !	32.219887524311446
Jane looked well , and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits , amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them .	12.643130734909988
She is almost three and twenty !	108.51279370719143
I must ask whether you were surprised ?	93.48345079005584
She listened most attentively to all that passed between them , and gloried in every expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , his taste , or his good manners .	12.59502152281756
But we are all liable to error .	82.0121697059433
Elizabeth could not but look surprised .	113.59572270062944
Bingley , from this time , was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn ;	45.90300790152194
Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him .	59.172348762472176
Younger sons cannot marry where they like .	67.6371150683069
I believe him to be Lady Catherine's nephew .	123.15275250668113
This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence , and the little value he put on his own good qualities .	13.337397472885351
and after stating her imprudence , I am happy to add , that I owed the knowledge of it to herself .	19.062413074304665
In future , I hope we shall be always of one mind .	45.02458115646057
I hope , my dear , said Bennet to his wife , as they were at breakfast the next morning , that you have ordered a good dinner to-day , because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party .	10.429244077448454
his friend had given him the earliest information of it .	64.6579128563665
But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration , and gave most gracious smiles , especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them .	9.739760379697723
Mary , said she , I wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun !	25.57613056158506
Steady to his purpose , he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday , and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour , he adhered most conscientiously to his book , and would not even look at her .	9.195661678628806
let us hear all the particulars , not forgetting their comparative height and size ;	23.774005089042035
My child , let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life .	16.631377809476252
I am sure I sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night .	19.24437094401708
Elizabeth's collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ;	42.00920279271649
but it pleased her .	331.69734051971386
It became her turn to listen .	119.71133514898523
Lady Catherine was generally speaking stating the mistakes of the three others , or relating some anecdote of herself .	15.126683138938679
At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress , and at half past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner .	13.733712190637366
and instantly embracing her , acknowledged , with the liveliest emotion , that she was the happiest creature in the world .	21.230952503100255
He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man , upon my word ;	29.13832661602644
Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year ?	41.37426120426351
but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood , I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger .	21.851501124457013
And who knows what may happen ?	95.11319472006748
They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter , will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others , for who , as lady Catherine herself condescendingly says , will connect themselves with such a family .	9.841846900961677
You have withheld the advantages , which you must know to have been designed for him .	26.715046387665375
If he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , I shall soon cease to regret him at all .	13.359865122726445
but I think I may defy even your sagacity , to discover the name of your admirer .	21.86728638839054
He now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before ;	7.7454551970320695
and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted , which , in her anxious interpretation , denoted a recollection of Jane , not untinctured by tenderness , and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her , had he dared .	8.132261945270525
Collins's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete .	59.852529322897986
I do not know what to say to you .	61.46582593324583

After tea , Bennet retired to the library , as was his custom , and Mary went up stairs to her instrument .	19.986524493642488
You must give me leave to judge for myself , and pay me the compliment of believing what I say .	16.91715890044397
- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works .	17.208488085500818
Our poor mother is sadly grieved .	93.42701910920113
Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through Longbourn-house .	35.01092180231807
and as it had been asked without the least suspicion , she was not distressed by his repeating it .	22.805031823028475
and I could wish , Miss Bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either .	10.860479079079179
Whenever Charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ;	22.056215456430508
But , my dear , you must indeed go and see Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood .	18.808208908600786
Elizabeth was distressed .	595.992328063995
or me either , for that matter .	125.03981995080765
Haggerston has our directions , and all will be completed in a week .	42.80316836965433
and as she was no horse-woman , walking was her only alternative .	33.09982712967714
Her coming there was the most unfortunate , the most ill-judged thing in the world !	45.530155222065744
and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with , though she could not be in such raptures as Collins expected the scene to inspire , and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house , and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis De Bourgh .	7.347340919267693
The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady , to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable ;	17.66899014435648
Darcy drew his chair a little towards her , and said , You cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment .	16.048615001446233
His being such a charming young man , and so rich , and living but three miles from them , were the first points of self-gratulation ;	18.062646015939244
Let me do it without farther loss of time .	52.24060743776094
sensible that if such an idea had been suggested , his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it .	13.275675051272055
My dear aunt , how could you think of it ?	70.69835131185424
Lady Catherine , I believe , did a great deal to it when Collins first came to Hunsford .	21.399181104653938
I began to be afraid you would never come back again .	65.38637441428072
What could become of Bingley and Jane !	111.7820281059543
I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me , but if the same circumstances were to happen again , I am sure I should be deceived again .	13.335189993653014
said her mother .	852.7953533906884
good or bad ?	642.4582924877449
They were in street .	351.9047126366714
It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat , and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour .	11.405480255603566
Darcy had been at her sister's wedding .	187.75333393068067
Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme ;	45.41556984970947
her husband looked impenetrably grave ;	210.47716704944222
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind , as was here collected in one individual .	10.189047933129803
Such as vanity and pride .	152.24266319789095
Miss Lydia is going to be married ;	146.39684387676076
for Bennet , having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase , than she entered the breakfast-room , and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection .	6.877702169588296
Thank Heaven !	1459.6468769151008
We have certainly done our best ;	96.02995531115107
Wickham began the subject himself .	248.68034773595429
Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day , and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation , c .	21.555477189022337
and for the first evening she was his settled choice .	69.39563229131724
Elizabeth was excessively disappointed ;	307.59250041364874
If your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless , you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ;	13.371484370588643
The easy assurance of the young couple , indeed , was enough to provoke him .	32.20203561493233
She followed him thither ;	272.27050461883596
He meant to resign his commission immediately ;	74.18852844301053
Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared , Darcy was continually giving offence .	23.64755150800379
that he is to take possession before Michaelmas , and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week .	21.639258402320884
Nor did he seem much more at ease ;	59.12243131577085
Why was he to be the judge ?	128.6098531743277
But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge ?	28.63783218940834
Hurst and Bingley were at piquet , and Hurst was observing their game .	29.026504213933745
I must beg , therefore , to be importuned no farther on the subject .	29.493964331018795
As the weather was fine , they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park .	16.231335519167484
Then shewing her purchases : Look here , I have bought this bonnet .	23.362501681975672
and so did Forster .	293.2653960167987
I never saw a more promising inclination .	77.51351633077687
Every girl in , or near Meryton , was out of her senses about him for the first two months ;	27.230111833727292
and pray what is the result ?	166.64645972244958
Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter , and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Bingley himself , instead of a ceremonious card .	10.999829100351269
My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents .	9.200184638088013
Perhaps that is not possible for any one .	90.75657694814109
It was a painful , but not an improbable , conjecture .	35.674070925569964
My mother was taken ill immediately , and the whole house in such confusion !	33.68087899611175
To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered , but the state of indecision in which she remained , as to the extent of what she should communicate ;	8.124169924814193
And you are never to stir out of doors , till you can prove , that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner .	13.687183957682382
He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from that , I am inclined to hope , he might have been misunderstood before .	17.352684605254307
and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop , or Lady Catherine de Bourgh , by venturing to dance .	8.771481404456468
Do you think it incredible that Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ?	14.869384775769863
but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side , I hope it will not be long before they are .	16.739371920996224
Elizabeth was pleased to find , that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend , for , though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world , she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him .	11.842017301002393
But who could have foreseen such an attention as this ?	56.748995267228885
and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin's affairs , and whose character she had no reason to question .	10.989812674985675
Compliments always take you by surprise , and me never .	57.956100741938926
or under what misrepresentation , can you here impose upon others ?	27.976788464847004
My feelings in every respect forbid it .	78.37441221487052
The families who had been in town for the winter came back again , and summer finery and summer engagements arose .	18.58246505045133
I could not bear to have her ten miles from me ;	53.40444196182138
Such were the gentle murmurs of Bennet , and they gave way only to the greater distress of Bingley's continued absence .	16.764423261692496
Jane was so admired , nothing could be like it .	59.73723082849203
their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ;	35.78244284892991
You ought all to have learned .	156.79972523517324
yes , said Elizabeth drily Darcy is uncommonly kind to Bingley , and takes a prodigious deal of care of him .	17.24379155296189
If it be so , if I have been misled by such error , to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable .	17.867361558308538
I am a gentleman's daughter ;	172.8833600564208
But I confess they would have no charms for me .	56.90485393590964
That is my idea of good breeding ;	107.24803892756422
but , to be sure , it would have been such a thing for me !	47.60448793609702
But I am willing to hope the best , and that his character has been misunderstood .	34.941458521326005
But their father , though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure , was really glad to see them ;	26.37952580560676
To be sure , Lizzy , said her aunt , he is not so handsome as Wickham ;	35.63741891750532
Wickham so very bad !	380.26784219484085
She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire , and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister , in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter .	10.591518335362862
Every thing was too recent for gaiety , but the evening passed tranquilly away ;	27.553294999202375
and yet , it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham .	15.623649830958586
Most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote .	24.98171209647492
He was on one side of her mother .	109.4445698671351
He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given me .	12.497719198758675
Collins must excuse me .	298.0970714735506
I wish you very happy and very rich , and by refusing your hand , do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise .	12.915582114292233
but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing .	40.995678732744445
Bennet made no answer .	264.4814912302498
The hill , crowned with wood , from which they had descended , receiving increased abruptness from the distance , was a beautiful object .	10.982322340787078
She was humbled , she was grieved ;	113.20613443227253
He who , she had been persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest enemy , seemed , on this accidental meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance , and without any indelicate display of regard , or any peculiarity of manner , where their two selves only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister .	6.493865218060389
Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received , in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense .	16.387321877463663
By the Author of Sense and Sensibility .	51.67910674995184
These are heavy misfortunes , replied Elizabeth .	78.44714058791563
and I assure you , I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement .	21.824993938913337
I felt nothing but surprise .	213.60266752953171
Did he know of their intending to go off ?	67.24521456990423
Give my love to Colonel Forster , I hope you will drink to our good journey .	25.13712793924418
Lady Catherine has been of infinite use , which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use .	19.333877181967598
Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers' names and connections .	30.120647356169858
That she should have walked three miles so early in the day , in such dirty weather , and by herself , was almost incredible to Hurst and Miss Bingley ;	15.2785293697943
she continued to declare that she would , and the argument ended only with the visit .	34.648187397606186
for else they will be destitute enough .	100.19346936969026
We were married , you know , at Clement's , because Wickham's lodgings were in that parish .	23.675357535435612
A great deal more passed at the other table .	70.81947023435923
They descended the hill , crossed the bridge , and drove to the door ;	27.359767277644902
But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her , so soon after this event .	22.991184695802417
The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte's situation , and his expectation of a young olive-branch .	21.865883965548576
I never thought Darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do .	30.069755122733326
The children , two girls of six and eight years old , and two younger boys , were to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane , who was the general favourite , and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way teaching them , playing with them , and loving them .	6.870093482040373
He arranges the business just as he pleases .	70.12120952812529
I have a warm , unguarded temper , and I may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him , and to him , too freely .	15.50355992151517
Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth .	38.56199002225837
and had I been the rector of Longbourn , I should very strenuously have opposed it .	22.012743420275875
A little sea-bathing would set me up for ever .	33.50443185526643
a most convenient distance for the young ladies , who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week , to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner's shop just over the way .	9.760152216252866
Oh !	3082.833849588038
Elizabeth would not observe her ;	216.67762148271208
After sitting a few minutes , they were all sent to one of the windows , to admire the view , Collins attending them to point out its beauties , and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer .	9.08357160904007
The others then joined her , and expressed their admiration of his figure ;	38.85721670206421
I wish I could hear that you , my dearest friend , had any intention of making one in the croud , but of that I despair .	19.814436077761783
We will go as far as Meryton with you , said Catherine and Lydia .	27.10859266759039
I hope they will not meet at all .	86.83115094449198
Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom , which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family .	10.418050481213209
Collins knew not what to make of him .	90.5593932323385
One came from her books , and the other from her toilette .	50.57228722368164
Very well .	1447.564372327282
She could not determine how her mother would take it ;	53.70935510215169
And have you answered the letter ?	130.55909489611324
Pemberley was now Georgiana's home ;	221.5030424095018
I am very sensible , madam , of the hardship to my fair cousins , and could say much on the subject , but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate .	12.572649432543969
my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ?	13.204074824428085
Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House , whichever it might be , where Darcy then was .	13.819673131953124
Gracechurch-street , Sept .	606.3020616030311
All connection between us seemed now dissolved .	67.22975496605474
He keeps a man-servant , does he ?	69.4524375545562
It was lady Catherine de Bourgh .	113.98256052700559
She is so fond of Forster , said she , it will be quite shocking to send her away !	20.2195340707393
my dear Charlotte , impossible !	278.5490459912061
and I doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself , Darcy .	29.753081799605226
CHAPTER XIX .	1311.7971600904
and after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family .	34.08321794408153
What will be his surprise , thought she , when he knows who they are !	30.99892095441213
For a few moments , indeed , she felt that he would probably strike into some other path .	25.59726443212711
He was angry .	648.06674718813
A man who has once been refused !	71.23580362655578
most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman's education .	17.29971841807031
Upon my word , said Gardiner , I begin to be of your uncle's opinion .	38.63162915222573
She had no fear of its spreading farther , through his means .	35.39850533537974
Nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination , said Elizabeth .	45.91359030855561
Do you draw ?	562.096898388185
You go to Brighton !	327.3720147272584
and the others were to meet us at the church .	77.52794013370035
No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you , can think any thing wanting .	28.848911269585834
He added , that Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present , to leave London , and promised to write again very soon .	21.83325750225914
How I long to see her !	137.8585984440969
Elizabeth made no answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Darcy , and reading in her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it .	8.406659338634956
Miss Bingley saw , or suspected enough to be jealous ;	73.40852783086217
and , though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy's father , five years before , it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends , than she had been in the way of procuring .	11.588901962112427
The business of her life was to get her daughters married ;	63.43190262473027
Darcy took her advice , and did finish his letter .	52.23444779355483
Bingley was good looking and gentleman-like ;	109.32695265984387
Had not my own feelings decided against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man , who has been the means of ruining , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ?	8.056728804076199
if I should ever go to Brighton , I would behave better than Lydia .	40.47483420209296
It is I believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world .	21.23247591155132
She felt it so ;	378.45514732499066
and when Bennet joined them at supper , his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was .	13.248366308590153
Elizabeth felt Jane's pleasure .	289.79370905856
Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal , and felt persuaded of her sister's ready acquiescence .	29.053709749933294
But I will no longer importune my young cousin .	49.96102691743324
Then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce Bingley to her .	30.760956787367917
That he was really fond of Jane , she doubted no more than she had ever done ;	34.99567164286105
At present , however , I consider myself as quite fixed here .	39.39779434123092
a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification ;	47.903501958509075
Mary and Kitty were both with Bennet : one communication would , therefore , do for all .	18.042087444699597
unless when some barbarous neighbour , who could not be enough detested , had given him an invitation to dinner , which he thought himself obliged to accept .	14.035496723538094
Had she not seen him in Derbyshire , she might have supposed him capable of coming there , with no other view than what was acknowledged ;	18.30420540477309
She dreaded seeing Wickham again , and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible .	26.621517402293183
How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton !	34.262551621022126
why did she come ?	412.8075847770492
Darcy was writing , and Miss Bingley , seated near him , was watching the progress of his letter , and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister .	12.805083330694144
Why did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight ?	31.754084399607443
They must be a great loss to your family .	84.95086125429171
And on the gentlemen's approaching , one of the girls moved closer to her than ever , and said , in a whisper , The men shan't come and part us , I am determined .	12.183112878772006
and it was not till Easter-day , almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival , that they were honoured by such an attention , and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening .	9.971511837113834
Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room , and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless .	12.592502292614222
( by the bye , Forster and me are such friends ) and so she asked the two Harringtons to come , but Harriet was ill , and so Pen was forced to come by herself ;	9.000259502249857
The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow .	16.758226106908314
At first there seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely , for she was a most determined talker ;	20.799118844782566
They were of a respectable family in the north of England ;	52.88683856426109
though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy .	50.76789829249261
Bennet was not in the habit of walking , Mary could never spare time , but the remaining five set off together .	15.990965852391069
Accordingly , when she retired at night , she asked the chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place , what was the name of its proprietor , and with no little alarm , whether the family were down for the summer .	10.777664434434632
But if you will listen to his letter , you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself .	23.082835184285223
She is a very headstrong foolish girl , and does not know her own interest ;	33.05003174878389
I had often seen him in love before .	109.54117962613854
Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion , sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation .	7.953411691220376
consequently that she is aunt to the present Darcy .	96.33518067796967
Miss Bingley did the same ;	300.10341581647225
Elizabeth did all she could , to shield him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification ;	12.332803041711808
In that county , there was enough to be seen , to occupy the chief of their three weeks ;	24.313066164459787
You and papa , and my sisters , must come down and see us .	34.098383840978805
but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley , she dropt all her resentment ;	16.645290498550345
for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire , and of his being gone into the regulars .	26.426401565177162
The motive professed , was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known , as to make it impossible for any young woman of character , to love or confide in him .	9.23578418599561
If he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare , he determined to make enquiries there , and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach .	7.705832814108002

I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say .	22.53684118898379
I do not trust my own partiality .	104.08178035466008
Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits .	60.13231399125326
In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her a present from my master ;	20.687203714373233
And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock .	25.546481139438708
You cannot be more than twenty , I am sure , therefore you need not conceal your age .	23.174282375178045
and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment .	17.708734770209162

But if you have got them to-day , said Elizabeth , my mother's purpose will be answered .	28.099543380528456
And when I returned home , the shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time .	24.673688833358863
I could not have parted with you , my Lizzy , to any one less worthy .	33.631552306782005
and he and Bennet spent the morning together , as had been agreed on .	38.198270241491684
made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow's debts , and got him his commission !	18.33774459289643
You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works , reports , performances and research .	7.645126742817058
On entering the room , he seemed to hesitate ;	85.2669304416965
I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it .	28.483154949318003
Sometime hence it will be all found out , and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before .	13.86390076730502
or had you intended any more serious consequence ?	62.350880430031935
I am trying to make it out .	112.98285938774244
I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet , she is really a very sweet girl , and I wish with all my heart she were well settled .	14.67072492225148
I am not one and twenty .	115.77832527090305
Will it not be advisable , before we proceed on this subject , to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request , as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties ?	7.390383364112944
I am afraid you do not like your pen .	56.904070283717644
Then , after a short silence , he continued , Lizzy , I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May , which , considering the event , shews some greatness of mind .	8.743531526318423
It was as follows : MY DEAR SIR , I feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire .	7.887466507055684
Her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved .	88.77901483055636
I admire all my three sons-in-law highly , said he .	40.62798139420623
I should be sorry indeed , if it were .	77.4022487146666
Darcy made no answer .	264.4367311546806
Darcy , you cannot deny the fact .	118.13961091203194
and within five miles of Lambton , Elizabeth found from her aunt , that Pemberley was situated .	24.571635265799415
I have never heard him say so ;	87.97491541997988
and his answering immediately to the last question Oh !	63.39371109851299
Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness , and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover , she could not prevent its frequently recurring .	12.114326673331707
Darcy mentioned his letter .	319.44409524413544
Kitty , to her very material advantage , spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters .	24.58827529684454
but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away , just as they were all getting so intimate together .	8.428662079987115
But I tell you what , Miss Lizzy , if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at all and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead .	7.446615852629249
I will not be interrupted .	238.02289085978978
I desire you will do no such thing .	70.93988802195712
Elizabeth did not know what to make of it .	75.26320750826768
Elizabeth said nothing , but it gratified her exceedingly ;	60.69984769922802
I will answer for it he never cared three straws about her .	28.50807617178023
I am grieved , indeed , cried Darcy ;	80.6553889228143
And now here's Bennet gone away , and I know he will fight Wickham , wherever he meets him , and then he will be killed , and what is to become of us all ?	12.43088561830401
Gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her .	41.742419313370334
Yes if Darcy does not put it off again .	59.032229326705306
but it would not do ;	339.59505971410783
Since the shire were first quartered in Meryton , nothing but love , flirtation , and officers , have been in her head .	19.41851690566064
and , after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt , her resentment gave way , either to her affection for him , or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself ;	13.661977560144685
I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing .	38.76415368346157
I have been making the tour of the Park , he replied , as I generally do every year , and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage .	13.194815592520936
Perhaps he thought her too young .	125.12425898093326
The fishing scheme had been renewed the day before , and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon .	14.01048210119961
I am not so selfish , however , as to press for it , if inconvenient .	33.928671704922984
I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself .	87.91176369726216
What he told me was merely this ;	86.16231743294841
To Elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ;	9.333434432859471
Hill began instantly to express her joy .	85.84897891877036
but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes , and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt .	17.44281104396409
Indeed !	6914.001990722626
There is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King .	49.196433045010274
Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish ;	136.1392645094236
My dear Lizzy , do not give way to such feelings as these .	34.036772498328965
in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of every thing , she was still dear to him .	24.523747253895788
The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's match , which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true !	6.790516169855401
A military life is not what I was intended for , but circumstances have now made it eligible .	24.067048119404653
And , besides , no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road .	28.913183999680015
She was roused from her seat , and her reflections , by some one's approach ;	28.605515954397323
She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken .	76.3005389154748
it is of no consequence .	257.1878372372377
Elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion , that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Bingley's invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's amusement ;	8.970159007952558
In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty ;	25.87056589802142
A most delightful place !	286.8668261365116
To Kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected .	47.27218028359627
We may compare our different opinions .	82.86952161944002
This will never do .	377.4170433548068
the door was then allowed to be shut , and the carriage drove off .	42.1766596033634
such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her , and she began her song .	26.80317899680524
Lydia gaped as he opened the volume , and before he had , with very monotonous solemnity , read three pages , she interrupted him with , Do you know , mama , that my uncle Philips talks of turning away Richard , and if he does , Colonel Forster will hire him .	7.686148749696136
CHAPTER XVIII .	1403.50908934543
You know nothing of the matter .	167.7716443845785
Sir William did not say much .	185.39460434565166
She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico , muslin , and cambric , and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders , had not Jane , though with some difficulty , persuaded her to wait , till her father was at leisure to be consulted .	8.928963666847746
but , had she still felt any , it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself , on seeing her again .	10.986698197705245
He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance , and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption ;	20.086765423929876
Insolent girl !	1615.5343476850212
but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful .	40.1734040826345
While she spoke , Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words , or to distrust their meaning .	11.72980156538344
and when she had gone through the whole letter , though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two , put it hastily away , protesting that she would not regard it , that she would never look in it again .	11.499541872604363
Oh !	3082.833849588038
Painful recollections will intrude , which cannot , which ought not to be repelled .	31.44506531564003
Allowing for the common demands of the game , Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth , and she was very willing to hear him , though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told , the history of his acquaintance with Darcy .	12.682596375374201
He cannot know what Darcy is .	172.54686023336075
With the officers !	822.5900311323488
Charlotte says , she hardly ever does .	113.74826728749733
Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below .	34.647432246701456
I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady .	35.00319173969694
and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love .	17.488814448640923
Oh , yes !	522.7852403671635
You have deprived the best years of his life , of that independence which was no less his due than his desert .	18.021896871587852
No , no I feel he may defy us there .	43.508332641102484
It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy .	54.32727417010182
untamed , unabashed , wild , noisy , and fearless .	41.48151454747119
You look pale .	606.6757647639912
but , whenever she did catch a glimpse , she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said , she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed , however temporary its existence might prove , had at least outlived one day .	7.416607335633309
but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly .	12.791748826530082
If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew , I shall certainly not be kept from it , by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss De Bourgh .	12.376818253698925
but it is to the credit of his modesty .	112.91225603300984
He was at the same time haughty , reserved , and fastidious , and his manners , though well bred , were not inviting .	19.50448121746988
re-considering events , determining probabilities , and reconciling herself as well as she could , to a change so sudden and so important , fatigue , and a recollection of her long absence , made her at length return home ;	10.472342742281421
The evening conversation , when they were all assembled , had lost much of its animation , and almost all its sense , by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth .	14.989549804040573
CHAPTER II .	1348.6026098015038
Can there be any other opinion on the subject ?	72.93555681777084
he will immediately comprehend what I must feel , and I rely upon his goodness .	29.759661630340297
Lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath ;	19.629459634353612
Depend upon it , my dear , that when there are twenty , I will visit them all .	28.745244145173277
She was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger , and wondered it had escaped her before .	19.25212776961114
It is highly improper .	250.52846904015567
He leaves out half his words , and blots the rest .	41.62326127315142
To complete the favourable impression , she then told him what Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia .	17.108026751201624
and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to , a wish of being better acquainted with them , was expressed towards the two eldest .	15.283463237693283
Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring ?	62.66301551935476
She looks sickly and cross .	146.0309715015474
Upon my word , Caroline , I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by imitation .	14.619277434848197
Who should suffer but myself ?	166.3833793569314
Your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach , that the contentment arising from them , is not of philosophy , but what is much better , of ignorance .	14.471994627399884
My father and mother knew nothing of that , they only felt how imprudent a match it must be .	17.293496695271486
I had much rather go in the coach .	82.64695688438282
The adieu is charity itself .	135.21277768141067
I am truly glad , dearest Lizzy , that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes ;	18.65343436830384
Collins , did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe's calling yesterday to thank me ?	22.85526518671393
He is now perhaps sorry for what he has done , and anxious to re-establish a character .	24.828566536367386
and if , as you were mounting your horse , a friend were to say , 'Bingley , you had better stay till next week , ' you would probably do it , you would probably not go and , at another word , might stay a month .	9.577314148188234
I have heard from authority , which I thought as good , that it was left you conditionally only , and at the will of the present patron .	17.422964593327464
Collins was eloquent in her praise .	148.53695240075
but Elizabeth saw , with admiration of his taste , that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine ;	26.46529844673584
Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room ;	35.132401327679574
As they walked across the lawn towards the river , Elizabeth turned back to look again ;	21.156564354129795
Oh , Lord !	630.172521115542
Well , Jane , make haste and tell us ;	64.83395726263524
If you believed it impossible to be true , said Elizabeth , colouring with astonishment and disdain , I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far .	12.58242167963813
I know you do ;	392.55788391477495
In confirmation of this , she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected , without actually naming her authority , but stating it to be such as might be relied on .	11.605643980511859
Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town ;	34.123337821001236
They were all astonished ;	327.7864835126455
I cannot believe it .	332.14562659978543
adding , with a significant smile , I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here .	12.50610899882498
He answered her in the same style , and the subject dropped .	64.62176036481755
I would not be so fastidious as you are , cried Bingley , for a kingdom !	39.03808972021815
Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ;	79.90857091030684
Indeed I am .	1144.0270511389056
Your profusion makes me saving ;	146.3370996923055
She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of ill humour , which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her .	10.662578122901332
Oh !	3082.833849588038
She is a very fine-looking woman !	126.50339442136041
and there was no necessity for such attention .	86.98688426567081
I was sometimes quite provoked , but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane , and for their sakes had patience with her .	15.81432617269789
Are you so severe upon your own sex , as to doubt the possibility of all this ?	27.649762282768787
but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham ;	16.992222857196115
and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you .	8.782980337449185
That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment , as to refuse his daughter a privilege , without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid , exceeded all that she could believe possible .	7.839415958961829
It must not be thought of .	207.14137357954033
Oh , Jane , had we been less secret , had we told what we knew of him , this could not have happened !	15.021148030809643
Our instrument is a capital one , probably superior to You shall try it some day .	16.125081872650803
You thought the waiter must not hear , as if he cared !	48.34866542814098
said Elizabeth to herself .	482.0556684590357
He protested that except Lady Catherine and her daughter , he had never seen a more elegant woman ;	25.799264491924617
He was her dear Wickham on every occasion ;	67.50983992379048
You must contrive to send somebody .	106.21872705908505
Let me never see either one or the other again !	47.38697706332763
But why Darcy came so often to the Parsonage , it was more difficult to understand .	27.997882575042592
Oh !	3082.833849588038
It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Darcy himself ;	33.26606938543596
There is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair , on which I do not reflect with satisfaction ;	21.296365794983405
A great many indeed , said her companion with a sigh .	46.685563904935876
Yes , my youngest is not sixteen .	130.81996098415212
Yes , Sir , I know I am .	135.13197976571487
She tried , however , to compose herself to answer him with patience , when he should have done .	24.072174357166144
Sir William staid only a week at Hunsford ;	81.71681489524585
The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him .	32.691720949012705
his brow contracted , his air gloomy .	82.0855915898091
Only let me assure you , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage .	14.02966250923594
Every thing nourishes what is strong already .	75.34468809021224
how I laughed !	611.4823192175696
but you must lend us the money , for we have just spent ours at the shop out there .	17.826727223910037
His friend had left him that morning for London , but was to return home in ten days time .	19.136246983819802
When Bennet arrived , he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure .	37.574901167403084
I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character , in a part of the world , where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit .	10.140601180472462
But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham .	29.09134994689087
Darcy had walked away to another part of the room .	56.73513162205842
Was not this some excuse for incivility , if I was uncivil ?	33.320932225997716
Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father , who had intended to purchase an estate , but did not live to do it .	11.594200713303222
that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that one false step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful , and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex .	7.867342615115365
Our importance , our respectability in the world , must be affected by the wild volatility , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia's character .	11.674908770784384
I have found out , said he , by a singular accident , that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness .	18.23938816650332
My dearest sister , now be be serious .	80.93741116321489
but Charlotte , she soon found , was depending on the plan , and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty .	13.56056529448307
to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where , and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with .	18.793136150196265
Their mutual affection will steady them ;	83.25126294432549
He came , and in such very good time , that the ladies were none of them dressed .	35.71438479608696
and certainly ought not to have appeared ;	126.21237580053602
and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , I have not yet learnt to condemn them .	10.697095850930562
But , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes time , and then we all set out .	21.807736961875076
and if the second , I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire .	29.480394149753185
Yes , she called yesterday with her father .	107.52687723782357
It is from Miss Bingley , said Jane , and then read it aloud .	40.518325394815406
My poor father !	549.7667450028935
Elizabeth instantly read her feelings , and at that moment solicitude for Wickham , resentment against his enemies , and every thing else gave way before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness .	10.267491226620448
A thousand things may arise in six months !	44.55178547562624
We do not suffer by accident .	123.02550776061287
and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters , in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about .	9.132579323629312
Your's , c .	487.4441142809693
Elizabeth almost stared at her .	197.51143457730345
Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time , but Darcy they had only seen at church .	18.000358982285714
Gracechurch-street , Monday , August 2 .	106.09562035290045
but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me .	20.43312046207754
and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia's flight , on her own folly alone .	23.099089264296556
She was received , however , very politely by them ;	50.765813167505016
You must not be too severe upon yourself , replied Elizabeth .	45.04736201647407
The country , said Darcy , can in general supply but few subjects for such a study .	22.515837210598637
She had only to say in reply , that they had wandered about , till she was beyond her own knowledge .	23.705160325639355
His pride , in that direction , may be of service , if not to himself , to many others , for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by .	14.652647521060464
I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation , replied Elizabeth , but it is not in my power to accept it .	17.515979186684692
But he found , in reply to this question , that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country .	12.377701756127413
Pride , observed Mary , who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections , is a very common failing I believe .	15.639408597550217
My friend has an excellent understanding though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Collins as the wisest thing she ever did .	11.165667022868535
This was not very consoling to Bennet , and , therefore , instead of making any answer , she went on as before , I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate .	15.87673428197252
in which case you may be sure of my pardon .	78.63576239572771
the windows are full west .	162.22777550879772
neither did the apothecary , who arrived about the same time , think it at all advisable .	25.06672079737253
The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this .	31.82118945755424
Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls , and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him .	15.104665742044835
You deserve no such attention .	177.68801524386063
for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend's dislike would vanish , if she could suppose him to be in her power .	15.770660648338916
The next morning , as she was going down stairs , she was met by her father , who came out of his library with a letter in his hand .	21.51480952446655
Yet it did , and even a third .	111.84534321653446
I am glad he is gone .	157.36855884887055
There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself .	13.909469829755546
With such rivals for the notice of the fair , as Wickham and the officers , Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance ;	18.7065323743758
but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only .	28.81543283319889
Who could about such a nasty little freckled thing ?	43.56467507912228
A small sum could not do all this .	88.68436314163839
and having to relate such a thing of his sister !	75.42054907233728
Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt .	84.46938334333873
I almost envy you the pleasure , and yet I believe it would be too much for me , or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle .	18.544137982742598
Oh !	3082.833849588038
Poor Charlotte !	1594.5643351963172
She grew absolutely ashamed of herself .	111.93479516444103
Oh !	3082.833849588038
We must trespass a little longer on your kindness .	52.273553232059406
Philips's vulgarity was another , and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance ;	35.18141270055022
I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back .	23.204650818124108
Had the late Darcy liked me less , his son might have borne with me better ;	19.941755590372818
Oh !	3082.833849588038
It would not be easy , indeed , to catch their expression , but their colour and shape , and the eye-lashes , so remarkably fine , might be copied .	13.244032481774406
And poor Darcy !	555.1997910470316
You are lucky in having such a master .	70.02867730109011
Is this to be endured !	284.38340339087694
Mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted ;	65.12005288877677
It was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re-animated , and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's attractions .	13.837693181470842
I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side , for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing , if she had been well looked after .	12.91722571302973
It is Bingley I am sure .	124.66021091767762
It cannot be for me , it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened .	25.08076632153194
He had by that time reached it also , and holding out a letter , which she instinctively took , said with a look of haughty composure , I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you .	10.068606220791795
the former continued the subject , by saying , But tell me all and every thing about it , which I have not already heard .	19.089865087103515
my dear Lydia , she cried , when shall we meet again ?	55.312659196625695
and sleeping one night on the road , reached Longbourn by dinner-time the next day .	18.877774284972496
Yes , I call it a very easy distance .	93.96244891513797
and then till her sister came down , she had to listen to all he had to say , of his own happiness , and of Jane's perfections ;	21.281772236618345
Elizabeth immediately began playing again .	146.39777314043508
Good gracious !	1373.0350778783054
To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh ;	42.84376198205522
where , where is my uncle ?	209.62542888767445
And with no one to speak to , of what I felt , no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had !	12.224622315557044
How could I ever think her like her nephew ?	50.04486049579088
Within doors there was Lady Catherine , books , and a billiard table , but gentlemen cannot be always within doors ;	18.820133554200197
A house in town !	461.670253325773
It seemed like wilful ill-nature , or a voluntary penance , for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away , but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her .	7.461663420394273
I am going to Gretna Green , and if you cannot guess with who , I shall think you a simpleton , for there is but one man in the world I love , and he is an angel .	11.842918696731529
But perhaps , added he , stopping in his walk , and turning towards her , these offences might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design .	7.923208610697629
Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten ;	81.22400799995273
Well , well , and so Bingley is coming down , sister , ( for Philips first brought her the news ) Well , so much the better .	12.535042537563683
We never had any governess .	210.22222317833143
and no change was visible in either , except that the loss of her favourite sister , or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business , had given something more of fretfulness than usual , to the accents of Kitty .	9.725979242333274
With the mention of Derbyshire , there were many ideas connected .	39.40548957619825
and detestable as such a step must make her were it known , she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go .	13.99947724179373
He seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologised for his intrusion , by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within .	14.702844805964805
for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce .	39.3880520694466
With a stronger voice she soon added , I have this comfort immediately , that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side , and that it has done no harm to any one but myself .	9.846633582779543
and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane , received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth .	13.797932152226213
Collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure , and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview , with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied , since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character .	6.923164327368534
but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy's opinion , and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities , by which some part of her family were connected with that corps .	7.467745841407651
I suppose you have heard of it ;	157.01340327851455
VOL .	5682.7059499578245
and , though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene .	11.683455040307313
added Elizabeth ;	1584.0707820387897
In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton and see how every body went on ;	15.86397535200796
She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject , and related , with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration , the shocking rudeness of Darcy .	11.66976976181707
and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource , if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family , were unfavourably answered .	16.700323602678907
But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible ;	41.405006066303145
I believe I have now told you every thing .	75.75614986762146
He did trace them easily to Clapham , but no farther ;	34.712087434453665
This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers , but Bennet , who quarrelled with no compliments , answered most readily , You are very kind , sir , I am sure ;	12.390102065055615
And gathering her work together , she was hastening away , when Elizabeth called out , Dear Ma'am , do not go .	17.109625086218788
for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him .	24.938210672340155
Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy , and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps .	19.880977357943976
On the gentlemen's appearing , her colour increased ;	59.286146810816774
Oh !	3082.833849588038
yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said , You are mistaken , Darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way , than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner .	9.139469909854876
and then thought no more of the matter : and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them , restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike .	11.297166188778194
and in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard .	12.734031507592373
as good natured , and as unaffected , though not quite so chatty .	40.335094136448184
for of what use could it apparently be to any one , that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him , should then be overthrown ?	14.354023204923934
Oh !	3082.833849588038
He could number the fields in every direction , and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump .	15.502705300949009
Bennet had very often wished , before this period of his life , that , instead of spending his whole income , he had laid by an annual sum , for the better provision of his children , and of his wife , if she survived him .	10.779963946024303
His sisters were fine women , with an air of decided fashion .	27.54571561198631
On the following Monday , Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife , who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn .	13.969470490565914
Kitty has no discretion in her coughs , said her father ;	49.097202208760145
she really rejoiced at it .	162.11522994967882
By many significant looks and silent entreaties , did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance , but in vain ;	14.171771679165582
He answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily .	11.104051891614079
and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion , that whenever Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate , it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at James's .	9.539686000195102
Miss Lucas is married and settled .	107.32654532965049
Bingley was ready , Georgiana was eager , and Darcy determined , to be pleased .	35.38852468094251
and she could do nothing but think , and think with wonder , of Darcy's civility , and above all , of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister .	20.644093405947107
Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight , and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister .	15.82916362279746
The good news quickly spread through the house ;	79.27781061212491
Let us hope , therefore , that her being there may teach her her own insignificance .	27.20959213724413
He seldom appeared really animated .	135.22044243205195
Having now a good house and very sufficient income , he intended to marry ;	32.2793046223529
You refuse , then , to oblige me .	93.74204674873111
Miss Bingley I am sure cannot .	166.20208928796617
and , moreover , to enter into an engagement of allowing her , during your life , one hundred pounds per annum .	13.997815989934871
After sitting a little while with Jane , on Miss Bingley's appearance and invitation , the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour .	12.507012060475656
names , facts , every thing mentioned without ceremony .	44.20371374453318
Lady Catherine seemed pleased .	329.9479453008833
Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest .	82.87331285625721
I have not that pain .	190.22465868998574
The ladies were somewhat more fortunate , for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window , that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse .	8.662251974076549
he had a pleasant countenance , and easy , unaffected manners .	54.91096130564249
and I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body .	12.539024085673326
his civility , therefore , was most prompt in inviting Collins to join his daughters in their walk ;	20.65530569037254
But I knew I should persuade you at last .	70.45962219834148
though it was not put in as it ought to be .	66.97796093064137
the agitations of former partiality entirely so .	55.885291163125046
but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune , part from her authoritative manner , and the rest from the pride of her nephew , who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class .	9.56699236794674
She was not the better pleased with his gallantry , from the idea it suggested of something more .	23.646809069844874
Sir William could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves .	20.439410728697872
The letter was to this effect : MY DEAR LIZZY , I wish you joy .	26.24955038728757
Your own heart , your own conscience , must tell you why I come .	24.956209176872616
without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person ;	61.16482449973052
and to Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction .	61.49506231694416
I wonder what he can be doing there .	86.83824325877929
Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment ;	55.97343196860948
What , all five out at once ?	89.21478338283836
Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance , when you were in Kent ?	28.939576380228935
After walking several miles in a leisurely manner , and too busy to know any thing about it , they found at last , on examining their watches , that it was time to be at home .	12.826262916271443
but she does not know , no one can know how much I suffer from what she says .	28.046952368708702
Wickham , after a few moments , touched his hat a salutation which Darcy just deigned to return .	14.021152228054659
But , Lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it .	38.25234766737877
Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss De Bourgh ate , pressing her to try some other dish , and fearing she were indisposed .	10.280581373152462
Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage .	23.59355630157035
But when her mother was gone , Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters .	22.63429869654016
What a stroke was this for poor Jane !	47.055074076582
and she had barely time to express her satisfaction , and prepare for such a visitor , when Bingley's quick step was heard on the stairs , and in a moment he entered the room .	12.391802626669941
Yes ;	4459.007412392422
Oh , yes !	522.7852403671635
Such a change in a man of so much pride , excited not only astonishment but gratitude for to love , ardent love , it must be attributed ;	13.790054073305337
I am sure , she added , if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and suffers a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without exception , the sweetest temper I ever met with .	9.330871928768774
She was confident of having performed her duty , and to fret over unavoidable evils , or augment them by anxiety , was no part of her disposition .	12.816869014975122
You will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one .	31.570542385975408
She is a handsome girl , about fifteen or sixteen , and I understand highly accomplished .	22.294244147888982
repeated the other , as she ran into her room to prepare .	49.87963988442184
Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them ;	115.35961462004646
She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever ;	33.831225272527085
Lady Catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us , were the means of removing all my doubts .	22.80784323939387
I expected to find a more reasonable young woman .	72.54230618091802
Darcy , only for a few minutes to take leave , but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour , hoping for her return , and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found .	13.095331531932453
Give me farther particulars .	296.8121424784927
do not repeat what I then said .	134.76344099389348
That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain , but I will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears .	8.59378624342345
Gardiner looked at her niece , desirous of knowing how she , whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its acceptance , but Elizabeth had turned away her head .	10.088683190526375
He really believed , that were it not for the inferiority of her connections , he should be in some danger .	30.615453420288407
Her ladyship received them civilly , but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else ;	11.067639777934652
Collins , said she , speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter ;	33.78482846769705
He is just what a young man ought to be , said she , sensible , good humoured , lively ;	20.92091014225695
And when we do return , it shall not be like other travellers , without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing .	16.894583166443674
Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection .	63.64669764077999
He simpers , and smirks , and makes love to us all .	53.67918257743263
I cannot understand it .	289.52654083510686
Can you , yourself , Lizzy , so wholly give him up , as to believe him capable of it ?	28.05659452027192
She was a woman of mean understanding , little information , and uncertain temper .	34.655598292492826
said Elizabeth , but the terms , I suppose , must be complied with .	47.414261408385116
Yes , Miss Bennet , interest ;	157.41015771240794
The visit was returned in due form .	69.34640499796126
But Jane was to go home with her , and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation .	29.024576813713086
They were ignorant , idle , and vain .	87.90990421468916
Yes .	6869.407052802037
accompanied by a violent yawn .	239.7815928306748
Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other .	52.688037988864394
But who was your mother ?	234.86036648048545
Then pray speak aloud .	251.6162224038317
but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent .	23.589172763802267
And when her sisters abused it as ugly , she added , with perfect unconcern , Oh !	21.600756238760525
But if I go on , I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem .	21.866060806765383
and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners , which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball .	15.998247332506335
when it became apparent , that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match .	11.572002639778825
and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance .	75.53868639262728
But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world , replied Darcy .	15.668187006176604
and added , that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage .	15.141974262644267
She highly approved his forbearance , and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other , as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn , and during the walk , he particularly attended to her .	10.34248379781752
True .	6162.734186746455
Bennet , through the assistance of servants , contrived to have the earliest tidings of it , that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side , might be as long as it could .	11.592782763226587
Indeed you are mistaken .	420.3354909874028
Lizzy , to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family !	29.400785147425946
Not a soul knew of it , but and Forster , and Kitty and me , except my aunt , for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns ;	18.83326494164768
From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage , it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew ;	18.234001624309144
That he was not a good-tempered man , had been her firmest opinion .	41.9388888026943
She longed to see Philips , the Lucases , and all their other neighbours , and to hear herself called Wickham , by each of them ;	20.161056697039264
Does your charge give you much trouble ?	86.89746939850194
It has been a very agreeable day , said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth .	63.40912943938661
Can I have the carriage ?	366.8386722882282
CHAPTER V Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth ;	20.90766643542826
at his own house especially , and of a Sunday evening when he has nothing to do .	36.094447052829246
When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance , and courting the good opinion of people , with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace ;	11.812372825234153
And that made the men suspect something , and then they soon found out what was the matter .	19.834583361409877
It must be something particular , to take him there at this time of year .	28.610456672603664
In what an amiable light does this place him !	42.795336139277445
The envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , hot pressed paper , well covered with a lady's fair , flowing hand ;	8.564834550143555
but the shortness of her stay , and yet more , the alteration of her manner , would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer .	19.728741501307724
Perhaps it would have been better ;	186.91100015077174
Have not you always hated him ?	117.18915756249119
but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence , what chance could there be of improvement ?	18.78755947081623
I am not now to learn , replied Collins , with a formal wave of the hand , that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first applies for their favour ;	8.284715762918967
for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible .	51.20234805774338
The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming ;	8.875997860886097
Elizabeth , who was left by herself , now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled , that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation .	8.286512470126365
She could think of nothing else , and yet whether Bingley's regard had really died away , or were suppressed by his friends' interference ;	12.647244495761644
And she was only sixteen last June .	97.49471725411964
I think you said she was a widow , sir ?	68.56558058445736
Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine , who called out to know what they were talking of .	29.27995764181774
I do assure you , that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain .	22.721189770198862
Many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter ;	55.36354228680134
Lady Catherine , I have nothing farther to say .	75.47285344737891
and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible .	10.294805499466538
yet there had been that in his voice , which was not like ease .	53.439603002617936
But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Darcy's pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers ;	14.381584102427647
He then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not tired , and they stood together on the lawn .	17.642540548432752
The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn .	46.19223992545192
Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these ;	38.422883534051785
Risk any thing rather than her displeasure ;	109.12902532366543
There was now an interest , however , in believing the housekeeper ;	46.69485744275459
But his pride , his abominable pride , his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane , his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging , though he could not justify it , and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Wickham , his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny , soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited .	7.108414017605968
They are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses ;	21.19952600035954
Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's .	46.58332387312925
Well , I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Bingley .	40.02719377947043
No governess !	1575.8292355191436
But our visitor was very obstinate .	118.44664440692067
As a clergyman , moreover , I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence ;	9.065056942644878
When she is secure of him , there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses .	21.123108446135667
She had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses , which he had already had the honour of preaching before her .	15.881473346171024
He drew a chair near her .	106.22075657866024
But whatever may be the sentiments which Wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character .	10.2459950870298
Georgiana's reception of them was very civil ;	123.25664186342549
Oh !	3082.833849588038
But how did he account for it ?	91.90825911349687
Bennet was really in a most pitiable state .	109.07592647746738
My father is gone to London , and Jane has written to beg my uncle's immediate assistance , and we shall be off , I hope , in half an hour .	13.323346914992232
Mary was the only daughter who remained at home ;	66.62102998670281
It is not Bingley , said her husband ;	122.68123013684738
how unlucky !	1587.1192365079683
Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as Elizabeth half expected Bingley to do , he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine's visit .	9.510330028864091
Do not copy , display , perform , distribute or redistribute this electronic work , or any part of this electronic work , without prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1 .	6.594728593360016
But , whatever may be their own wishes , it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother's .	22.68311072218
He then went away , and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself .	13.533958673586438
is she handsome ?	642.4582924877443
She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could , provided he chose with discretion ;	14.419611588000304
she knew not how to believe that Darcy could be so unworthy of Bingley's regard ;	32.98993681895907
I dare say you will find him very agreeable .	67.53081739257576
That is right .	620.4683037906493
and what can he have to say ?	117.81816606177676
His disposition must be dreadful .	239.09404667330568
But the fact is , that being , as I am , to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father , ( who , however , may live many years longer , ) I could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters , that the loss to them might be as little as possible , when the melancholy event takes place which , however , as I have already said , may not be for several years .	7.007467097555522
and you shall all have a bowl of punch , to make merry at her wedding .	22.985602915897175
Till the next morning , however , she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance .	30.3163371908265
If you are a good girl for the next ten years , I will take you to a review at the end of them .	20.407856340748335
Elizabeth loved absurdities , but she had known Sir William's too long .	39.49140652488909
Women fancy admiration means more than it does .	71.23616499451597
Your's sincerely , c .	280.8299034870197
I shall offer to pay him to-morrow ;	97.08821582664672
said she .	1724.8475078893864
But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Wickham , when she read with somewhat clearer attention , a relation of events , which , if true , must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself , her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition .	6.5899505577960635
Almost as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life .	17.46922771098597
Oh !	3082.833849588038
and his sisters are charming women .	125.25411514507473
and will probably be much talked of .	100.17697384345922
and soon afterwards Darcy , drawing near Elizabeth , said to her Do not you feel a great inclination , Miss Bennet , to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel ?	14.078311200601126
I had not been long in Hertfordshire , before I saw , in common with others , that Bingley preferred your eldest sister , to any other young woman in the country .	15.838162683471605
It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again !	33.19435915743836
You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this .	19.840307627066203
The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed , the unacknowledged were silent .	29.87174421809373
Very true ;	1588.491336192813
I should be sorry to think so ill of him , in the very beginning of our relationship .	30.741191562289732
But on returning to the drawing-room , when her letter was finished , she saw , to her infinite surprise , there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her .	14.44329993683763
and Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected .	39.26711641685657
He then said , I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly .	20.52277021045734
four or five thousand a year .	111.4072905669651
they are all silly and ignorant like other girls ;	45.45303366029566
Collins was not a sensible man , and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society ;	16.472884301241034
I am going to open the instrument , Eliza , and you know what follows .	35.7834736143669
His fear of her , has always operated , I know , when they were together ;	45.39081174391243
nor will I be dissuaded from it .	71.5368797215641
Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it , and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards ;	10.764587355643162
You have liked many a stupider person .	71.57321789143522
I will go to Meryton , said she , as soon as I am dressed , and tell the good , good news to my sister Philips .	18.438940418443696
He brought it with him for us to see .	88.30218300167819
I have done with you from this very day .	80.06143534067883
and thither also went Wickham , undoubtedly by design ;	41.68046099270935
there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance !	72.29226283819291
You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided that - You pay a royalty fee of <PERCENTAGE> of the gross profits you derive from the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method you already use to calculate your applicable taxes .	3.888368788537375
Yet he knew to the contrary himself .	139.28846569730325
but that after their removal , it had been every where discussed ;	41.58710648041448
but since we see every day that where there is affection , young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune , from entering into engagements with each other , how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if I am tempted , or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist ?	5.7730581152582285
yes , his misfortunes have been great indeed .	91.18463102475354
she repented , though she hardly knew of what .	73.02837380323669
And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him , without any reason .	15.277325252585403
Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse , and that she could not leave her .	30.148638251093328
But people themselves alter so much , that there is something new to be observed in them for ever .	17.893200088662333
Miss Darcy and her brother appeared , and this formidable introduction took place .	49.800160906894405
She related the subject of the pictures , the dimensions of the rooms , and the price of the furniture , in vain .	26.23201367347592
Yes , all of them , I think .	136.6205038661806
If I was to go through the world , I could not meet with a better .	49.65570942607817
What , is he coming home , and without poor Lydia !	52.179976911107346
At our time of life , it is not so pleasant I can tell you , to be making new acquaintance every day ;	20.701027381086696
I would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ;	24.634711069409516
I talked about the dance , and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room , or the number of couples .	16.925104402983198
I had not thought Darcy so bad as this though I have never liked him , I had not thought so very ill of him I had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general , but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge , such injustice , such inhumanity as this !	7.763870256650979
E Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg : 1 .	25.38475316452226
and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn , they would be going there for ever .	21.728130931760248
As for the gentleman himself , his feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence .	10.266549268517512
inmates of the same house , sharing the same amusements , objects of the same parental care .	29.53229403188713
But what is to be done about Pemberley ?	87.84823893120942
In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage .	51.15215482445237
And men take care that they should .	106.14889645659821
Elizabeth accepted their company , and the three young ladies set off together .	33.25136619976743
They may be modified and printed and given away you may do practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks .	11.695190004769568
Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball ;	13.306705539102499
She plays and sings all day long .	59.38944738957438
Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern .	71.29178887650654
The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl .	29.499154310679565
and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries , which Jane was equally eager to satisfy .	20.010538331155285
such an openness and gentleness in his manner .	75.37393131235343
The discomposure of spirits , which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into , could not be easily overcome ;	16.507570053314502
Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages .	10.618154652407604
and even Jane , who believed still less of it , became almost hopeless , more especially as the time was now come , when if they had gone to Scotland , which she had never before entirely despaired of , they must in all probability have gained some news of them .	7.579057950285012
But I wonder how long you would have gone on , if you had been left to yourself .	28.60241365380536
You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you .	20.822950988617396
Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Collins , and I will never see you again if you do .	16.07279820832724
whichever were the case , though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference , her sister's situation remained the same , her peace equally wounded .	14.192474696760037
To be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation , had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town ;	17.018442384896645
The possibility of Collins's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two ;	16.705688383063602
coaxed and threatened her by turns .	92.36160206146923
The housekeeper came ;	549.388980870122
She was of great use and comfort to us all , and lady Lucas has been very kind ;	22.64918969695558
and I trust I am resigned .	179.31681074340455
Perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her .	72.59034297225479
if that is all , I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire ;	32.92553189636289
Not that I care about it , though .	126.4685208909917
Howsoever that may be , you are grievously to be pitied , in which opinion I am not only joined by Collins , but likewise by lady Catherine and her daughter , to whom I have related the affair .	12.941094590041313
Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public .	54.22046058750069
The comfort to her , of the regiment's approaching removal , was indeed beyond expression .	33.66476474170614
so easily guided that his worth was invaluable ;	64.71734591227056
his estate there is a noble one .	104.23048963826027
and as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together .	11.826352466599621
Wickham !	6897.81836542083
but Lydia , with perfect indifference , continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter , and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day , as he was going the next morning to London .	13.617078171781106
and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected .	33.89409185242452
No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph .	42.612101069205174
Assistance is impossible ;	723.2116061771559
They had , therefore , many acquaintance in common ;	57.21939473997872
To my fancy , it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men .	20.442187015153838
Bennet said only , Nonsense , nonsense !	66.99985401360772
But does not Jane correspond with the sister ?	95.7643649298162
I cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought , nor their offences against myself .	12.669583161064988
But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood , and take Pemberley for a kind of model .	18.982578959949166
Lord bless me !	562.3223053690325
till , roused to resentment by his subsequent language , she lost all compassion in anger .	15.445199088909996
How much you must have gone through !	130.81742826212465
Lady Catherine was a tall , large woman , with strongly-marked features , which might once have been handsome .	21.083971851801465
But , perhaps he could not in her mother's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt .	24.401670255256033
Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse .	61.4394159743584
Who would have thought she could be so thin and small !	53.14655373627455
And so was I You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner .	21.56421133006474
It is such a spur to one's genius , such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind .	15.94418336661543
That she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head .	35.22693460941938
it was impossible not to long to know .	92.77983156485516
She will drop the acquaintance entirely .	104.02258075059227
If you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits , and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment .	10.210055305281873
In the gallery there were many family portraits , but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger .	17.506912970524404
Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome ;	20.153165339527156
We will settle with your father about the money afterwards ;	47.1009338547227
Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment .	153.60762515616392
Bennet had no turn for economy , and her husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income .	13.666739230504627
He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him , nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity ;	9.601986005303829
and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time , than as she hoped that , by Caroline's not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him .	11.4371063744534
But when she read , and re-read with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu , so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate .	8.158912670251574
As for their mother , Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will , and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure , which astonished her husband and daughters .	13.432918762205507
The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough ;	36.693259966520685
The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors , and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife , was exactly what he had wished for ;	11.566488449131983
Teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind !	56.61443158297217
She would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions .	55.38209669286434
This will not do , said Elizabeth .	154.27941613460925
Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage , and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at Rosings .	16.921199205486005
He has the promise of an ensigncy in General 's regiment , now quartered in the North .	19.090472595344888
and covering her face with her handkerchief , Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else ;	26.298817140957105
It was a handsome modern building , well situated on rising ground .	23.863651079251447
Oh , brother , how kind you are !	91.20587322387736
But if you are really innocent and ignorant , I must be more explicit .	39.02825483648802
Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she ceased speaking , replied thus , My dear Miss Elizabeth , I have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding , but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity , and those which regulate the clergy ;	6.903983372431361
That is exactly what I should have supposed of you , said Elizabeth .	40.59094710104044
If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is , I shall know what to think .	20.86989117086123
If she does not object to it , why should we ?	48.11628956905107
Having been frequently in company with him since her return , agitation was pretty well over ;	15.04535723719205
Philips visited them all , and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before .	21.230929434629196
Yours , c .	507.1035346297555
and so fervently did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets , which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity .	10.751772339138483
Louisa , you will not mind my waking Hurst .	60.138078118544755
I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much , and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help .	10.791645595775229
but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on .	28.91584877327241
Thank you , Sir , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me .	38.143878124087095
I think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements .	32.45698420727646
shall I get you one ?	183.9318900194564
Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication .	13.402053921895726
CHAPTER II .	1348.6026098015038
If your master would marry , you might see more of him .	35.78520049680848
From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane , and were indebted to Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along , and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton , which he never failed coming to inform them of , though it happened almost every day .	8.57111804772957
With three younger sisters grown up , replied Elizabeth smiling , your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it .	13.383902347028917
and now , because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds , you want to find out that he is mercenary .	17.14866012049361
Elizabeth , at work in the opposite corner , saw it all with great delight .	30.019494792040565
We now come to the point .	189.81907411487168
Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone ;	21.775725834494423
It had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought to be imitated , though it could not be equalled , by some exertion of politeness on their side ;	8.929021921768088
Collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed .	31.897831126571173
If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set forth in this agreement , you must obtain permission in writing from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael Hart , the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark .	4.581581187141046
The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions .	17.69162922084011
He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt's , where his regret and vexation , and the concern of every body was well talked over .	10.37852232043767
These causes must be stated , though briefly .	84.08335397358842
A little time therefore .	308.25846580394733
I did not wink at you .	114.85057739808909
Some people call him proud ;	148.20389107121596
Darcy only smiled ;	710.5787814529062
and Collins have a comfortable income , but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance .	8.219705230914556
Elizabeth particularly , who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy , was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied .	9.031135607064112
I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun .	62.47138396569989
for in a quarter of an hour's t te- -t te with Bennet before breakfast , a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house , and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes , that a mistress for it might be found at Longbourn , produced from her , amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement , a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on .	7.117397942583435
nor will such behaviour as this , ever induce me to be explicit .	31.941715666630177
Upon my word , Sir , cried Elizabeth , your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration .	13.805569132826935
Gardiner was a sensible , gentleman-like man , greatly superior to his sister , as well by nature as education .	19.971215909896234
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly .	39.65183597171695
You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles , for you are wasting your time with me .	16.053419754487358
though I thought it would be very good fun if I was .	54.53783561350184
Who is to fight Wickham , and make him marry her , if he comes away ?	34.27546537202941
She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country .	40.73576172436086
Bennet treated the matter differently .	202.79452487844236
Follies and nonsense , whims and inconsistencies do divert me , I own , and I laugh at them whenever I can .	14.343134538644707
Gardiner abused her stupidity .	250.43388391146672
You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine , but which I have never acknowledged .	19.18187867284235
His character is thereby complete .	155.75395591608182
and Miss Lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon that establishment were gained .	10.00661208886425
but Sir William's good breeding carried him through it all ;	31.873868408695117
My youngest sister has left all her friends has eloped ;	38.70611054996415
I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments ;	20.385721449732674
and without any intention of coming back again .	73.17174201031075
and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments .	38.64101777143672
They will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to Longbourn ;	25.58203725884024
Elizabeth looked archly , and turned away .	124.51255585669242
I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world , and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns .	16.7900614409079
But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed , so doubtful , so indefinite , that it gives me very little idea .	11.635362218433599
A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request , without waiting for arguments to reason one into it .	9.490860291587214
so handsome !	2001.3736720449583
The dinner too in its turn was highly admired ;	40.23891103740244
CHAPTER XVII .	1311.7971600904
one knows exactly what to think .	153.13042910053753
Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure ;	60.66305948213563
It was a rational scheme to be sure !	80.69093666990719
though her spirits are greatly shaken .	126.08029398270071
As they passed through the hall , Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and drawing-room , and pronouncing them , after a short survey , to be decent looking rooms , walked on .	9.712914995306607
CHAPTER V I have been thinking it over again , Elizabeth , said her uncle , as they drove from the town ;	23.78437139141684
Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane .	38.66511684835574
She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage , and had a few minutes' conversation with Charlotte , but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out .	15.945661053630054
But he had given a reason for his interference , which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief .	19.385551372412838
But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted .	29.12957543088018
and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself , is heightened into something still more interesting , from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister .	9.242967278966164
Upon this information , they instantly passed through the hall once more , and ran across the lawn after their father , who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock .	8.299790160667877
and Gardiner smiled .	691.2120466767406
Do not you want to know who has taken it ?	55.06678624705603
While they were dressing , he came two or three times to their different doors , to recommend their being quick , as Lady Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner .	11.635827858022054
and as soon as they were in the parlour , he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode , and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment .	10.4657027895307
He was directly invited to join their party , but he declined it , observing , that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together , with either of which motives his joining them would interfere .	7.148591557921553
pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before .	45.65314819918491
I am sorry to say it of them , but so it is .	55.28948053357878
Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat , he suddenly addressed her with , I hope Bingley will like it Lizzy .	12.731062190871242
1 .	4079.0161042043856
There is one point , on which I want your advice .	52.41458088823696
They then sat down , and when her enquiries after Rosings were made , seemed in danger of sinking into total silence .	12.816338171916213
I assure you , Madam , he replied , that she does not need such advice .	26.117310921687302
Her answer , therefore , was not propitious , at least not to Elizabeth's wishes , for she was impatient to get home .	23.51525772566108
Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to Miss Darcy , without calling her attention .	13.244808001634008
They both set off , and the conjectures of the remaining three continued , though with little satisfaction , till the door was thrown open , and their visitor entered .	14.110445844295988
I mend pens remarkably well .	146.50130948688013
He does not want abilities .	192.03625420205535
and though prepared , as he told Elizabeth , to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house , he was used to be free from them there ;	15.059735935706037
My situation in life , my connections with the family of De Bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ;	17.161418965499692
In Meryton they parted ;	305.56047250242204
You do not know what he really is ;	85.59501781998844
and , before she could reply , he added , It is above eight months .	31.492952728525587
We are each of an unsocial , taciturn disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room , and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb .	8.742291878701987
and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother , when they were met by the butler , who said , If you are looking for my master , ma'am , he is walking towards the little copse .	10.83558358881822
whence , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods overspreading many , and occasionally part of the stream .	8.88489765009455
I know you will contrive it all .	90.29485411940564
Their manner of living , even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home , was unsettled in the extreme .	18.27985560840931
Oh , lord !	504.8360273960898
but when the living fell , it was given elsewhere .	53.224233068694375
the morning in bustle and shopping , and the evening at one of the theatres .	32.128207309342805
The wedding took place ;	312.3660729801702
These are conditions , which , considering every thing , I had no hesitation in complying with , as far as I thought myself privileged , for you .	16.61023807017573
No aunt , no officers , no news could be sought after ;	42.43021757299126
but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity .	37.89842162708158
cried Bingley .	2076.145421759149
We want none of them ;	227.52442692031093
cried Elizabeth .	1373.851020902062
Sir William , how can you tell such a story ?	57.949945103845046
Yes ;	4459.007412392422
How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate !	18.065144786685185
She longed to speak , but could think of nothing to say ;	54.5805471217595
But the clothes , the wedding clothes !	116.28573950837131
Bennet and her daughters then departed , and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane , leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Darcy ;	16.049008880627802
Do not imagine , Miss Bennet , that your ambition will ever be gratified .	31.601903032815464
we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster's .	28.27382930993684
How humiliating is this discovery !	172.78112485589054
and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage ;	47.712541770073535
but I do not think there would have been any fun in it .	31.841671601226114
It is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us .	25.543160409584893
Not one party , or scheme , or any thing .	68.82358559945791
He replied , and was again silent .	154.3120912801132
So far each recital confirmed the other : but when she came to the will , the difference was great .	19.498148303359805
I dare say Bingley will be very glad to see you ;	50.62970446207662
Here you are in your own family .	171.56588219093865
Since her father's death , her home has been London , where a lady lives with her , and superintends her education .	18.502935369777678
Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire , paid his compliments , with his usual reserve , to Collins ;	18.667720499548047
Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter , Darcy must speak for himself .	19.558479307749046
You are a gentleman's daughter .	181.0523026816051
I do not recollect that we did .	85.80651649373179
As soon as they were gone , Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits ;	31.92608112400968
and have such tremblings , such flutterings , all over me , such spasms in my side , and pains in my head , and such beatings at heart , that I can get no rest by night nor by day .	9.19293835968821
Jane shook her head .	286.1490590144129
Upon my word I say no more here than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood , except Netherfield .	17.74392575981837
You are quite a visit in my debt , Bingley , she added , for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us , as soon as you returned .	12.25261763880787
for , by the bye , you are to understand , that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them .	16.09594282899023
but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation .	18.7333279750282
Let me know every thing that I am to know , without delay .	47.419687965489615
Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him , but this step ( and let us rejoice over it ) marks nothing bad at heart .	10.224249282130824
Yes , replied Darcy , who could contain himself no longer , but that was only when I first knew her , for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance .	12.372474737421783
I ask only a comfortable home ;	128.39543099554072
I certainly shall not .	443.00697195967655
I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us .	40.88043848666258
When they get to our age I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do .	15.50031469282425
Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine , was in a different style ;	63.42223013304019
and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it .	34.70499580978238
Bennet was doubly engaged , on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane , who sat some way below her , and on the other , retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases ;	10.572513763420137
Charlotte had seen them from her husband's room , crossing the road , and immediately running into the other , told the girls what an honour they might expect , adding , I may thank you , Eliza , for this piece of civility .	10.634832781301576
It has been coming on so gradually , that I hardly know when it began .	23.243671296209822
she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression .	38.241354977230415
yes the handsomest young lady that ever was seen ;	48.78952817589249
It is not that I do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman's of superior execution .	15.607086189691938
How much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow !	42.70235937137939
Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance , mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste .	10.195725866256554
My aunt Philips wants you so to get husbands , you can't think .	27.01949600820904
It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next , and a still greater , that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again , and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits , by all that affection could do .	9.295999947138073
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood , this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families , that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters .	8.229438568315546
Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified , never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting .	11.487681656565218
Next to being married , a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then .	25.52464904812098
Make haste , and come down this moment .	96.73288818585029
Now I have got some news for you , said Lydia , as they sat down to table .	28.81020602455414
what has she to do with it ?	164.1979908282056
Its windows opening to the ground , admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house , and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn .	8.012923022494105
That is to say , you had given your permission .	80.69286070094982
One may be continually abusive without saying any thing just ;	46.221396532687905
no it is not for me to be driven away by Darcy .	50.41351623309084
There was now employment for the whole party ;	111.17305056637942
The expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity .	17.759383472141177
I shall certainly try to get the better .	68.08559917295942
She read over her aunt's commendation of him again and again .	37.89181262845322
How is half such a sum to be repaid ?	78.64530142683759
and depend upon it , Bingley never stirs without him .	41.339624687141004
we are all in an uproar .	203.5896439456066
If , in the explanation of them which is due to myself , I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your's , I can only say that I am sorry .	11.721462713200111
Wont it , Kitty ?	570.9614975076029
Oh !	3082.833849588038
This accounted to Elizabeth for Wickham's being among them .	43.67189433873976
I shall now know how to act .	98.02261677082952
I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of the covies for you .	19.68156680924206
Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister , that they did not once sit down to a family dinner .	17.829393477372136
But I shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity of your sister's countenance and air was such , as might have given the most acute observer , a conviction that , however amiable her temper , her heart was not likely to be easily touched .	10.333429412745144
Who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly !	17.596158170889456
He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place , and his intrigues , all honoured with the title of seduction , had been extended into every tradesman's family .	10.204025040884403
Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment ;	21.527911340451052
But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being withheld from seeing Jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless .	8.536294332356963
CHAPTER VIII .	1403.50908934543
Long said so too , for I asked her whether you did not .	35.10432403077093
E8 .	6847.919774710029
That is very strange .	328.856264307202
Oh !	3082.833849588038
It was a subject which they could not mention before me .	50.685694458426475
But when you have had time to think it all over , I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done .	28.786978747180374
and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits ;	20.7539519234222
That is a question which Darcy only can answer .	55.64305688058342
You were not by , when I told mamma , and the others , all about it .	32.20466749376072
When Darcy returned to the saloon , Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister .	17.343262675301798
But that is one great difference between us .	68.36081085110364
Her mother stepped forwards , embraced her , and welcomed her with rapture ;	27.077748401012148
The express was sent off directly .	92.39066363449366
Could he expect that her friends would not step forward ?	53.96985070726981
Darcy !	5589.360213402174
and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature , by the testimony so highly in his favour , and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light , which yesterday had produced .	9.97276839499515
It is impossible for me to be impartial .	96.30033094583678
Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love ;	40.66845716939501
But vanity , not love , has been my folly .	56.93637645233166
His understanding and opinions all please me ;	57.941205807814974
When the party broke up , Lydia returned with Forster to Meryton , from whence they were to set out early the next morning .	13.98891959053393
and she spoke very little , except in a low voice , to Jenkinson , in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable , and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said , and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes .	10.16643614993073
but he soon afterwards said , I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month .	31.657951384493778
and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise , and owned she encouraged it as much as possible .	12.052875091682395
Yes , very different .	384.8276772711161
Jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening .	15.26996710189565
She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue , while in town , for the recovery of his daughter .	16.481325201931263
A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth ;	23.75704754108436
Jones says we must not think of moving her .	64.30298377848746
Why does she not come in ?	123.8128639304153
By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure ;	47.48913588632749
And that is quite impossible ;	233.73071495949944
An hour , however , saw the whole completed ;	86.04147325583519
Her sisters were uneasy for her , but her mother was delighted .	52.924712829699224
or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour .	18.803439137745315
You must decide for yourself , said Elizabeth , and if upon mature deliberation , you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife , I advise you by all means to refuse him .	9.160674139710771
and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions .	21.61512383180296
after going over so many , she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains .	17.767488388477673
Very few days passed in which Collins did not walk to Rosings , and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise ;	17.15400525197619
Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject ;	19.09183090289882
CHAPTER XV .	1311.7971600904
Never , even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield , or his dignified relations at Rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from self-consequence , or unbending reserve as now , when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed , would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings .	6.260412546717393
He has given in all his debts ;	108.74740823862032
CHAPTER VII .	1311.7971600904
Shall you like to have such a brother ?	135.65155424480645
Oh !	3082.833849588038
Your affectionate friend , LYDIA BENNET .	110.72437816872926
Did it , said he , did it soon make you think better of me ?	31.773381251171006
she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library .	31.24435074882333
However , he wrote some verses on her , and very pretty they were .	42.57282373269478
and at length , by repeated assurances that Darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the test of many months suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father's incredulity , and reconcile him to the match .	6.7823943167725025
It is more than I engage for , I assure you .	51.80687214911657
He walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very great !	38.28978181676384
As soon as they entered the copse , Lady Catherine began in the following manner : You can be at no loss , Miss Bennet , to understand the reason of my journey hither .	11.576764717436767
To his tacit engagement with Miss De Bourgh ?	60.21652539653067
Elizabeth , having rather expected to affront him , was amazed at his gallantry ;	36.24429874058841
But at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went sorely against the grain ;	10.262261309970114
What a pity it is , mamma , we did not all go .	42.65289106105599
But Bennet , was not so well pleased with it .	98.99120854744433
Tell me once for all , are you engaged to him ?	54.5666713775532
What a good joke it will be !	112.72698465504625
Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her .	22.861419882243027
and as they entered the house , he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men ;	17.95571129107381
and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary .	19.229732657577987
He would scarcely be ten pounds a-year the loser , by the hundred that was to be paid them ;	15.056345110613451
If such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy !	32.58507010814077
Jane , who was not so light , nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth , soon lagged behind , while her sister , panting for breath , came up with him , and eagerly cried out , Oh , Papa , what news ?	9.751173944477278
said Elizabeth .	1787.5588027056042
I shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on .	29.272191236210418
He had never had the slightest suspicion .	134.5481696659805
But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him , as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage ?	14.289989834659591
and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley , which might only grieve her sister farther .	13.767249102427746
He sat down for a few moments , and then getting up walked about the room .	25.625630419129685
Elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well ;	18.085012264719236
Her daughter , Miss de Bourgh , will have a very large fortune , and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates .	18.388848974384704
And we mean to treat you all , added Lydia ;	47.79830540724213
for he is now in the custody of his friend , and Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London !	20.08427771835574
Pursuing her way along the lane , she then began it .	40.91365288863804
She was disappointed , and angry with herself for being so .	47.04434574040216
She had been unwilling to mention Bingley ;	118.39035493724705
He is , indeed .	511.9588849480745
He was exactly what he had been , when I knew him in Hertfordshire ;	44.58524450326757
How can Bingley , who seems good humour itself , and is , I really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ?	18.434392354505704
She has a very good notion of fingering , though her taste is not equal to Anne's .	20.537654445278868
Haye-Park might do , said she , if the Gouldings would quit it , or the great house at Stoke , if the drawing-room were larger ;	13.886738248269467
We were born in the same parish , within the same park , the greatest part of our youth was passed together ;	16.788843638972352
CHAPTER II .	1348.6026098015038
but with respect to any other leading characteristic , I do not imagine that much has been unfolded .	20.412978767735616
When you told Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes , you meant it to be a sort of panegyric , of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone , and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else ?	6.709452603083018
for to her inexpressible vexation , she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Darcy , who sat opposite to them .	20.369868553751328
It is wonderful , replied Wickham , for almost all his actions may be traced to pride ;	21.419250523335254
At length , however , our kind friend procured the wished-for direction .	23.548507687930087
I think I have heard you say , that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton .	28.247663197592978
advice , which there was every reason to believe would be attended to ;	51.30279670656115
Elizabeth looked surprised .	634.8717112713058
I do not cough for my own amusement , replied Kitty fretfully .	32.96112229326826
To Rosings he then hastened to console Lady Catherine , and her daughter ;	33.39665288923815
I am astonished , said Miss Bingley , that my father should have left so small a collection of books .	19.270193373696603
I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly .	30.269049450416205
I was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off , and then I should have gone quite distracted .	16.781622483056953
they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money , great connections , and pride .	20.382404155108137
he continued after a pause , on seeing Bingley join the group ;	35.781065036005444
and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin .	29.624859666422978
Of this she was perfectly unaware ;	172.66917211939725
'Tis too much !	900.9614010340631
Not a syllable was uttered by either ;	63.932140488609015
Your's , very sincerely , M GARDINER .	81.70448450757706
Collins had a compliment , and an allusion to throw in here , which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter .	19.634087903332773
I have not the pleasure of understanding you , said he , when she had finished her speech .	21.013460882366886
But these things happen so often !	107.77184433942966
The suspicions which had just arisen of Darcy and their niece , directed their observation towards each with an earnest , though guarded , enquiry ;	10.614244654556215
and quitting them both , he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton , denominated from that period Lucas Lodge , where he could think with pleasure of his own importance , and unshackled by business , occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world .	7.653811372581217
I have not the smallest objection to explaining them , said he , as soon as she allowed him to speak .	19.590205610087278
F3 , a full refund of any money paid for a work or a replacement copy , if a defect in the electronic work is discovered and reported to you within <TIME_PERIOD > of receipt of the work .	8.832436671823011
but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal , that her mother , though often disheartened , had never yet despaired of succeeding at last .	11.069031724879576
He was quite young , wonderfully handsome , extremely agreeable , and to crown the whole , he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party .	14.13776264998066
Such relief , however , as it was in her power to afford , by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences , she frequently sent them .	13.47204727988462
It was to be such a secret !	184.66695122439003
and if he is disposed to make them any amends , I shall not be the person to discourage him .	21.7270083273687
His wish of introducing his sister to her , was a compliment of the highest kind .	45.04969480593823
Again she read on .	325.50607616827494
Will you tell me how long you have loved him ?	48.41861123271852
After discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , Miss Lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight ;	6.589501040780904
Yes , and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise .	63.68586860209943
I never heard that it was .	175.41376539509173
they are certainly not gone to Scotland .	95.49276707117939
for it gratified him , he said , to discover that Charlotte Lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter !	14.886144628067354
I did not expect such a compliment .	140.00380498804955
Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other , and the waiter was told that he need not stay .	25.839210263079305
She watched him whenever they were at Rosings , and whenever he came to Hunsford ;	33.0382831738371
Their party in the dining-room was large , for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news : and various were the subjects which occupied them ;	9.980126411381232
and if we were beyond the hour , we could not be married all day .	32.61480560010548
My dear Madam , replied he , let us be for ever silent on this point .	27.209530871456245
But when the gentlemen entered , Jane was no longer the first object .	46.12524529828475
Of what are you talking ?	176.83373236410745
We have heard only once .	183.56033557640868
With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn , and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart .	13.384217508049993
It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl , whom he was violently in love with only a few days before .	9.990981022159087
It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her .	23.877886912193294
Has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style ?	27.262693666801265
he merely answered her question , and read on .	64.86765542846842
If we make haste , said Lydia , as they walked along , perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes .	13.567785944357693
Elizabeth read on ;	669.8267566762256
You will be a very happy woman .	170.14836962766995
the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers' wives , and Elizabeth continued her walk alone , crossing field after field at a quick pace , jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity , and finding herself at last within view of the house , with weary ancles , dirty stockings , and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise .	5.335940414034062
But as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you .	34.53345956427163
Two obstacles of the five being thus removed , Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time , without making any impression on them .	9.564058115575243
but this would be nothing if you really liked him .	55.4016473503042
yes .	6271.69929924415
and really , upon serious consideration , I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter .	15.157282065491495
and her mother was too happy , to be quite so obstinate as usual .	41.763077083620544
though I am sure ( and I do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it , ) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole .	11.844525889204698
and till the evening after the visit was paid , she had no knowledge of it .	28.105038987847134
It is no such thing .	221.08163067641271
Excellent Parsonage House !	549.1421248858585
I hope you have destroyed the letter .	111.75660248976511
She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings , and had sent for him only the Saturday before , to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening .	11.032291283141676
I am sure there is not on his .	116.05958057285079
I am sure we never read the same , or not with the same feelings .	31.596518404311116
Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast .	9.535258848266805
Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them .	36.29492337716249
She felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Wickham , and rejoiced in it .	25.869744530566468
Oh , no !	794.9199107412481
And taking her hand , he would have given it to Darcy , who , though extremely surprised , was not unwilling to receive it , when she instantly drew back , and said with some discomposure to Sir William , Indeed , Sir , I have not the least intention of dancing .	11.037363681667973
She certainly did not hate him .	142.32438965674888
Had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it ;	35.988841816893455
The rapture of Lydia on this occasion , her adoration of Forster , the delight of Bennet , and the mortification of Kitty , are scarcely to be described .	13.271259435119825
I wonder my aunt did not tell us of that .	61.65950676489822
Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage , and when it drove off , Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house .	19.158697912261346
Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , Jane and Kitty followed , but Lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could ;	16.28736058632157
No one made any reply .	153.30225127342646
Bennet wondered at their coming , and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble , and was sure Jane would have caught cold again .	14.763252834755917
and the consciousness of this , was another reason for his resolving to follow us .	32.192772651831156
Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity ?	38.995129384208475
But with such a father and mother , and such low connections , I am afraid there is no chance of it .	21.75762590329387
she has got over the most trying age .	77.62999158832599
the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment ;	21.008815560351632
I think I have heard you say that you know them .	59.921869055119146
but his cousin , after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Collins , sat for some time without speaking to any body .	11.98095779166666
and on this account , as well as some others , found herself , when their visitors left them , capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction , though while it was passing , the enjoyment of it had been little .	10.897759547981943
If Elizabeth , when Darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of its contents .	15.445304710531124
Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours , he had yielded to his brother-in-law's intreaty that he would return to his family , and leave it to him to do , whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit .	10.773097951067486
You may , in fact , carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire , my dear cousin .	17.857152181220314
hopeless of seeing him before .	253.35024672545853
I will put on my things in a moment .	61.150878032267244
Yours , c .	507.1035346297555
You are a good girl ;	212.30552307159942
As soon as they entered , Bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information ;	14.472294784439859
but his perfect indifference , and your pointed dislike , make it so delightfully absurd !	25.508688367178156
Will you hear it ?	283.98920000733057
Society , I own , is necessary to me .	102.57763517358745
I hope not .	666.4001423233469
Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had originated in jealousy , she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her , and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady's side , the acquaintance would now be renewed .	7.360206763221268
Not the slightest .	644.7774968477529
This was a lucky recollection it saved her from something like regret .	24.737923473455567
but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation .	39.65084215708566
How strange must it appear to him !	97.23376615696195
She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man , who , in disposition and talents , would most suit her .	15.83053593449175
I must beg to return to the house .	87.13114902065983
Why , indeed , he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head , as you will hear .	23.072999995591708
On his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him , which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said , Did not you think , Darcy , that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when I was teazing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton ?	7.471006372210595
Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter .	23.843355623119532
The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat , drink , and sleep , and pursue the usual course of their employments .	13.766310549875168
They had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister .	29.227924472189347
She found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable .	23.51343749556279
I congratulate her .	607.1185121353951
In such cases , a woman has not often much beauty to think of .	31.207919003418894
After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity , Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday .	10.152071376958924
There , Bennet .	832.278767823231
It appears to me so very unlikely , that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless , and who was actually staying in his colonel's family , that I am strongly inclined to hope the best .	8.358309192455266
for , besides the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her .	24.20470164741957
Yes , replied Wickham ;	358.10695206804235
I will have no reserves from you .	107.76803261941198
And now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be ;	21.082930440247228
My aunt , she continued , is going to-morrow into that part of the town , and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor-street .	18.624719870348166
You give me fresh life and vigour .	67.66364154059269
I say no more than the truth , and what every body will say that knows him , replied the other .	26.73144826828811
Her keenest attention was awakened ;	167.97368541758382
She really looked almost wild .	135.20638372402868
Miss De Bourgh was pale and sickly ;	70.89445007596312
Consoled by this resolution , she was the better able to bear her husband's incivility ;	32.39078461552763
There is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us .	26.06200357855091
He is his own master .	233.11529741578397
We live in so different a part of town , all our connections are so different , and , as you well know , we go out so little , that it is very improbable they should meet at all , unless he really comes to see her .	9.064096946784424
I should like it beyond any thing !	110.16647427067244
You shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased .	17.524610691812793
Lady Catherine de Bourgh , she replied , has very lately given him a living .	26.481109117107334
My courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me .	31.20838444568158
I wish you had been there .	149.53635933268006
But to be guarded at such a time , is very difficult .	57.796246484277034
He is perfectly amiable .	315.2558933500025
Why , he has four or five thousand a-year , and very likely more .	32.47153747518102
Have you any other objection , said Elizabeth , than your belief of my indifference ?	34.255694241637215
told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her's , and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry .	15.737682649714833
Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth ;	60.703297627855925
He was resolutely silent however ;	136.08237462150453
How can you be smiling so , Lizzy ?	82.41140964806333
who could have done less for her ?	165.94676685457927
The person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund .	9.466977681571057
Well , Lizzy , continued her mother soon afterwards , and so the Collinses live very comfortable , do they ?	20.982839354731656
These parties were acceptable to all ;	120.1228562501916
Upon the whole , therefore , she found , what has been sometimes found before , that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire , did not in taking place , bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself .	10.990850591708497
she made a slight , formal , apology , for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was in every respect so altered a creature , that when she went away , I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer .	9.739807251079991
Gardiner , highly amused by the kind of family prejudice , to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master , soon led again to the subject ;	14.012795834502116
If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield , said Bennet to her husband , and all the others equally well married , I shall have nothing to wish for .	14.904819840692033
It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case .	39.99218214715286
Had he done his duty in that respect , Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle , for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her .	11.036442952424567
and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton .	16.154273181037006
He had some intention , he added , of studying the law , and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein .	13.844264350424911
Lord !	6162.734186746466
I am not equal to it .	141.88250979739354
Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch-street , and repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and herself , which proved that the former had , from her heart , given up the acquaintance .	11.09169525456509
His reception however was of the most flattering kind .	69.45357060540422
Bennet's eyes sparkled .	558.2137427233168
My aunt's intelligence had given me hope , and I was determined at once to know every thing .	25.872441114092844
I cannot think of it without abhorrence .	127.50570394059062
When she was discontented she fancied herself nervous .	64.11963777629705
Yours ever , CAROLINE BINGLEY .	157.67450597397223
I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time .	33.44900497090307
but it will have no effect on me .	90.50000676141845
and between her and Gardiner , with occasional help from Elizabeth , the conversation was carried on .	24.78454867601635
I must go instantly to my mother ;	124.09600007812395
He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while .	25.86800393404196
I cannot pretend to be sorry , said Wickham , after a short interruption , that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts ;	15.274028826309243
A man who had felt less , might .	86.02451216738055
B Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark .	102.28053452576187
and when at last Kitty did , she very innocently said , What is the matter mamma ?	24.63755730179741
If my vanity had taken a musical turn , you would have been invaluable , but as it is , I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers .	9.476646307031418
She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together ;	26.049616333862435
She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity , nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct .	19.09669544561149
I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country for my part , except the shops and public places .	10.05509765252392
but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough .	36.93617853375848
my dear , said Maria quite shocked at the mistake , it is not Lady Catherine .	29.10796905815607
When she was only fifteen , there was a gentleman at my brother Gardiner's in town , so much in love with her , that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away .	10.023134711203637
He had to be sure done much .	116.05891321058122
Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback , and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day .	17.564318504392755
But now suppose as much as you chuse ;	69.33015506618682
Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Darcy's progress through his book , as in reading her own ;	18.123022263324277
for Mary , on receiving amongst the thanks of the table , the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute began another .	11.964185027368023
The advice was followed readily , for the feverish symptoms increased , and her head ached acutely .	21.045023325545156
Letters of business too !	277.88550667044166
he was to come there with Wickham , you know .	89.82613833660609
Can you come to-morrow ?	288.6548072999941
And my aunt Philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good , added Kitty .	17.952423619983033
No , Lizzy , let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame .	23.63703674373452
I never heard of such a thing .	110.51680816984772
Are you , indeed ?	664.4644812705649
Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther , and when he ceased , the colour rose into her cheeks , and she said , In such cases as this , it is , I believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however unequally they may be returned .	7.673912891890357
What advantage can it be to you to offend Darcy ?	51.75985061606067
and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again , which I should think exceedingly probable , stay quietly at home , and be satisfied that we shall take no offence .	11.139310695350376
Miss Bingley saw all this likewise ;	139.40082946539897
Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me , because it would be imprudent ;	35.16706732901761
said Miss Bingley ;	870.068946650838
But his anger , I am persuaded , lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister's sentiments .	16.136645694853865
I knew enough of your disposition to be certain , that , had you been absolutely , irrevocably decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine , frankly and openly .	12.407256840309591
From such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink .	52.26084585779014
Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness .	48.91763097613718
This was exactly as it should be ;	156.86348641298576
Secondly , that I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness ;	30.103764049357032
It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he should .	44.63285266420822
They are young in the ways of the world , and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on , as well as the plain .	12.509412528228149
With the Gardiners , they were always on the most intimate terms .	49.80797200851446
She had a sister married to a Philips , who had been a clerk to their father , and succeeded him in the business , and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade .	13.867110246711238
Never , sir .	702.5114094511401
Dear Lizzy !	1601.7716826265441
How near it may be to mine , I cannot pretend to say .	46.22373057911921
for as the others were all going to sit down to cards , she could not be wanted to counteract her mother's schemes .	17.531815589268977
Elizabeth had received none since her return , that could come from Pemberley .	30.214693290700986
Jane was as much gratified by this , as her mother could be , though in a quieter way .	32.11580200591709
The officers of the shire were in general a very creditable , gentleman-like set , and the best of them were of the present party ;	19.63142762077904
It has been my own doing , and I ought to feel it .	46.50126757684345
Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face , and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections .	13.032425427895562
She explained what its effect on her had been , and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed .	20.84863815916706
CHAPTER XVIII .	1403.50908934543
No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth , and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful .	22.923518118462304
Your's , c .	487.4441142809693
You must and shall be married by a special licence .	51.56568305358174
But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them .	28.40490257171845
nor , when we attempt to describe any particular scene , will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation .	12.556513677495762
In this manner Lady Catherine talked on , till they were at the door of the carriage , when turning hastily round , she added , I take no leave of you , Miss Bennet .	15.339345350742061
and Elizabeth , agitated and confused , rather knew that she was happy , than felt herself to be so ;	22.10877297166351
If I had ever learnt , I should have been a great proficient .	49.85633461851815
She is quite a little creature .	167.94421490150063
Bingley does not know Wickham himself ?	138.33773694061563
I would not trust you so near it as East Bourne for fifty pounds !	22.24112551086239
He shall not be in love with me , if I can prevent it .	45.40452519573894
I did not expect it from you .	108.56614822307859
But in matters of greater weight , I may suffer from the want of money .	22.7399751155717
I came to you without a doubt of my reception .	71.39563361032891
Indeed I could not .	549.7373070383469
This is wholly unexpected .	281.7560682942774
and when they parted , after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield , and embracing her most tenderly , she even shook hands with the former .	11.298997275480694
My watchfulness has been effectual ;	207.01451063431585
c .	6937.161746028588
You may readily comprehend , she added , what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and ( comparatively speaking ) a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time .	9.816055228121352
That would be the greatest misfortune of all !	119.6751633246033
And so ended his affection , said Elizabeth impatiently .	65.6704728220959
Against staying longer , however , Elizabeth was positively resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked ;	18.418442194311417
Thank you but I always mend my own .	83.53648514479983
cried Elizabeth .	1373.851020902062
But the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me .	27.79071770282175
Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt's arrival .	34.39169469062046
Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more , and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly , there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity .	8.234167887201783
and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of Lord , how tired I am !	14.487785409981587
She does not yet leave her dressing-room .	127.83886391096777
for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming .	40.832178957825626
Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Bingley .	34.0571428163769
but she found herself considerably useful to both of them , in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur .	14.978338870192708
If there were any one , that one could apply to , with a probability of gaining such a clue as that , it might be of essential consequence .	17.099986659237167
but , however , I hope it is not true .	77.20837452051086
I am sorry it went off .	92.98977703228552
Charles , when you build your house , I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley .	21.335933898900276
She had gained her point , and had time to consider of it .	38.28404418742888
said Elizabeth , still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam .	101.76259177044912
and in his behaviour to me , there were stronger impulses even than pride .	33.6196926403197
Darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said , This walk is not wide enough for our party .	17.079775780654806
She did not choose it , said her daughter , she would go .	60.69789522105081
dear , yes ;	1201.47554975174
I declare I do not know a more aweful object than Darcy , on particular occasions , and in particular places ;	17.0921997915744
he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton .	75.02678031924805
But why all this secrecy ?	192.46354648515054
for he would certainly think the better of me , if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat denial , and ride off as fast as I could .	14.528558064434808
but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement .	20.07354838579719
That is all settled .	321.1636512389012
As the day of his arrival drew near , I begin to be sorry that he comes at all , said Jane to her sister .	25.810665039046828
I wish I could see her .	143.87152404385327
We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance .	16.824890623585024
The colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ;	14.005935217431148
But now that my dear uncle is come , I hope every thing will be well .	34.222796313348354
But , Lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or Jane at most .	20.897803780599087
You had better neglect your relations , than run the risk of offending your patroness .	16.23921036225498
His pride never deserts him ;	135.79372716062568
Yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the t te- -t te was over .	10.944814422488257
but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty .	19.98927184805537
Every park has its beauty and its prospects ;	47.76673280363253
It is , in short , impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them , without actual blame on either side .	10.71352306300046
Oh !	3082.833849588038
She then sat still five minutes longer ;	75.96729655046927
When the dancing recommenced , however , and Darcy approached to claim her hand , Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence .	7.202009454250631
Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ;	40.26585419745591
every sister except Mary agreed to go with her ;	61.48650743310256
You see on what a footing we are .	72.27103135482243
There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds .	41.24046865777459
and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion .	24.676414759386404
she only smiles , I laugh .	211.09079310946314
Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman , not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Bennet .	19.24258836707543
Bennet indeed said little ;	250.01456169849334
Bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county ;	39.66256205200976
Wickham's affection for Lydia , was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it ;	38.88070600743582
Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings ;	80.25681922514599
It is really too distressing .	158.2023618831651
Jane recollected herself soon , and putting the letter away , tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation ;	17.996240119348833
but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures , every idea gave way to the charm of recollection ;	17.5983324360043
How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it !	22.949326136348684
It had better have happened to you , Lizzy ;	96.676735847216
coming frequently before breakfast , and always remaining till after supper ;	37.25155653023795
Gardiner , who was walking arm in arm with Elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of her wonder .	20.432617402944537
Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once .	38.49700922130378
I hoped to find you reasonable ;	135.16637341999206
and I can never be in company with this Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections .	17.408928805494266
But not long was the interval of tranquillity ;	70.9625270236543
Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him ?	32.17107875984656
and the kindness of the late Darcy , though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his own words .	17.203350674390375
Not so hasty , if you please .	99.75386860882722
the latter of whom , however , could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her , in spite of all Miss Bingley's witticisms on fine eyes .	14.33811145347895
They went to the library , therefore , and asked their father , whether he would not wish them to make it known to her .	21.569918639636615
But consider your daughters .	274.94764313232935
and considering Collins's character , connections , and situation in life , I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair , as most people can boast on entering the marriage state .	9.864721221451111
Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts ?	87.49252028298733
said her aunt .	837.1139114794526
said she , I heard you before ;	139.4708451506625
You begin to comprehend me , do you ?	102.85592762691324
As to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , I am not able to judge ;	12.415381215093987
and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way .	30.115750939064114
and her mother , with manners so far from right herself , was entirely insensible of the evil .	28.909349351373532
EDW .	6847.919774710029
and they pursued the accustomed circuit ;	93.56680641362743
that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side , and that if it were , it must belong to Darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance .	13.02198246699774
No really , replied Elizabeth ;	238.83333846458615
but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely , more I think than last year .	24.346737806049713
when I went away , I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again !	24.147268652469354
but , though she could not look , she could listen , and he told her of feelings , which , in proving of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable .	14.8314469626191
and , after standing a few moments without saying a word , he suddenly recollected himself , and took leave .	20.617508825426377
The picture gallery , and two or three of the principal bed-rooms , were all that remained to be shewn .	24.42799645845023
I will read you the passage which particularly hurts me .	30.56710018744531
I am sorry for her , because , with her disposition , she may not get over it immediately .	28.889117409240605
which , as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence , she accordingly read ;	24.968945940367774
that speech savours strongly of disappointment .	83.03907874184496
but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear .	83.89522890883266
Perhaps I do .	879.3028586213804
but if he wished to converse with her , he might have better success .	42.17632665992628
It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man .	50.57205012495015
because we shall see the less of him .	98.04742905374577
No indeed ;	1611.8625692137691
Royalty payments must be paid within <TIME_PERIOD > following each date on which you prepare ( or are legally required to prepare ) your periodic tax returns .	7.035838391291335
Poor little Lizzy !	624.0822107722491
Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county , she was a most active magistrate in her own parish , the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by Collins ;	11.243352000167338
I hope , said she , as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day , you will give your mother-in-law a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her tongue ;	9.942978001500576
We had better not mention it .	141.29083557318103
Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as Bingley had now been gone a week , and nothing was heard of his return .	7.180182677948754
he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune , or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn .	11.228142257784581
She felt anew the justice of Darcy's objections ;	53.57245993626187
and all for the sake of Collins too !	92.36087074618021
but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting .	31.748067513645694
but , however , he did not admire her at all : indeed , nobody can , you know ;	26.25907264777783
Much as I respect them , I believe , I thought only of you .	51.57537101185424
with barefaced questions , ingenious suppositions , and distant surmises ;	43.58697679214544
Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting , that had she chosen it , she might by this time have been presented to her , as her future niece ;	15.875836434311534
Miss Darcy , the daughter of Darcy , of Pemberley , and Lady Anne , could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner .	19.13559616174321
She had turned away , but on hearing herself called , though in a voice which proved it to be Darcy , she moved again towards the gate .	16.16200042628591
She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known ;	32.52031687392824
If I have , I shall be the last person to confess it .	48.08888328638735
She was on the point of continuing her walk , when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park ;	10.947734666875808
To the girls , who could not listen to their cousin , and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument , and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle-piece , the interval of waiting appeared very long .	11.002237241422016
In talking over their route the evening before , Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again .	17.83054320743776
To yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you .	25.34434789383764
It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire , nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay ;	12.004071011776052
and she would , at times , have given any thing to be privileged to tell him , that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family .	16.11513426231628
Not one .	1598.8171242084697
said Jane as she finished it .	152.07699099104835
With assumed tranquillity he then replied , I have no wish of denying that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that I rejoice in my success .	12.50868326722642
Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring ?	44.18572166705963
But pride where there is a real superiority of mind , pride will be always under good regulation .	17.292247298258847
thoughtless , thoughtless Lydia !	253.8565113620305
I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness ;	29.913100881718403
With a triumphant smile , they were told , that it was ten miles round .	29.422685818770493
but the gentlemen will have Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton ;	43.51033732407933
You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion , which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty .	11.509213172770835
The necessity must be obeyed and farther apology would be absurd .	33.82674414867098
One of them does .	405.79051875769176
the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy .	41.13353615435234
Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity , and by the middle of June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears ;	12.314706941289467
Now is your time .	428.2853407968203
it was impossible to think of any thing else , and totally indisposed for employment , she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise .	11.849054338359787
They were not the only objects of Collins's admiration .	63.56469958738386
but her own opinion continued the same , and she left him disappointed and sorry .	30.77330025930262
but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal .	12.69060019253988
With a strong prejudice against every thing he might say , she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield .	19.071613312567916
Bingley met them with hopes that Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected .	22.654923021799156
To congratulate myself on the hope of relations , whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ?	18.34213765981592
I write rather slowly .	262.60652530959624
The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge , and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed .	12.518868908546336
This information , however , startled Bennet ;	100.17315485860716
Care of him !	986.1066950206734
It was drawn at the same time as the other about eight years ago .	28.304700322718354
There is , I believe , in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil , a natural defect , which not even the best education can overcome .	11.083717239165102
If !	6859.8485353390615
They have a sharp , shrewish look , which I do not like at all ;	28.373231555461807
as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general , was beyond the Collinses' reach .	32.37350025008112
My brother admires her greatly already , he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing , her relations all wish the connection as much as his own , and a sister's partiality is not misleading me , I think , when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman's heart .	6.978763295589415
But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend ;	16.138658697977945
Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile , she said , I did not know before that you ever walked this way .	15.228382543624127
My manners must have been in fault , but not intentionally I assure you .	26.110794061671054
I want to be told whether I ought , or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand Wickham's character .	20.586957343900714
and fearful of its being Darcy , she was directly retreating .	50.806285263553555
Oh !	3082.833849588038
What a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt !	38.344092715858
No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard .	30.16670755333512
Her mother's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determined not to venture near her , lest she might hear too much .	11.050244937545417
I certainly have not the talent which some people possess , said Darcy , of conversing easily with those I have never seen before .	13.431925052291296
A most welcome negative followed the last question and her alarms being now removed , she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself ;	10.057957205757232
I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship .	27.71519325267554
though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon regained her composure , and calmly replied , Why should you be surprised , my dear Eliza ?	18.036311459096943
While she spoke , an involuntary glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes .	9.205278628152868
Do clear them too , or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody .	29.902623362040895
I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children .	54.68591396155116
After making every possible enquiry on that side London , Colonel F came on into Hertfordshire , anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes , and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield , but without any success , no such people had been seen to pass through .	7.170120265018576
She was no sooner in possession of it , than hurrying into the little copse , where she was least likely to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the benches , and prepared to be happy ;	14.984887693032853
not equal to Lydia's for him .	122.86671983569161
She finds Miss Pope a treasure .	82.77467370289979
but the things should be ordered immediately .	88.24887693611122
I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn ;	42.36334691555788
The rest of the evening brought her little amusement .	62.16369465815068
and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy .	19.58164145464737
I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject , but I will not leave the country without confiding them , and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable .	9.718666913188137
Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings , Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy , calling for every one's congratulations , and laughing and talking with more violence than ever ;	10.677710042218521
She was perfectly sensible that he never had ;	98.43437592249018
till , shaking off his embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the gentlest of accents , You , who so well know my feelings towards Darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right .	9.036615578439651
But the morrow passed off much better than she expected ;	47.67519315298871
He spoke well , but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed , and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride .	13.8256249395518
and , according to the present plan , were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire .	26.88812906053213
I believed you to be wishing , expecting my addresses .	50.980796785003086
His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen , on his returning to Netherfield .	15.579097267045087
but it must be done .	280.90708416542077
I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object .	32.58837847797446
But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man , whom they had never seen before , of most gentleman-like appearance , walking with an officer on the other side of the way .	11.586258427114368
He is the best landlord , and the best master , said she , that ever lived .	37.55516407545816
Though it is difficult , said Jane , to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due , the wish is certainly to his credit .	10.374864263599456
I am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose Darcy's regard .	24.181927659963527
Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door , and the carriage stopped at the small gate , which led by a short gravel walk to the house , amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party .	11.084687116709018
We neither of us perform to strangers .	81.3384036399624
He observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ;	13.136019422527454
The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Bennet the next morning , but the post came in without bringing a single line from him .	12.637536013341307
Nothing that she could say , however , had any influence .	71.64371039517938
It is amazing to me , said Bingley , how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished , as they all are .	19.10712294643464
cried he .	1731.584699048337
If he means to be but little at Netherfield , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we might possibly get a settled family there .	10.961003598085671
Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself , but his manners were always so pleasing , that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought , his smiles and his easy address , while he claimed their relationship , would have delighted them all .	9.800227565147932
But my dear Lydia , I don't at all like your going such a way off .	34.28249218042569
E4 .	6847.919774710029
Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves .	14.000684794071514
and a fortnight only was wanting of it , when a letter arrived from Gardiner , which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent .	12.069862887136507
and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening , and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours , Miss Elizabeth , for the two first dances especially , a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her .	8.723383386227999
And there was my aunt , all the time I was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon .	17.23422506692767
It will save me a world of trouble and economy .	33.666673685297816
And what do you think she said besides ?	81.40878771516586
Jane went to him instantly , kissed him , and thanked him for his goodness .	33.59608240078883
and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter , she found little , except the professed affection of the writer , that could give her any comfort .	13.643957585929886
She is on her road somewhere , I dare say , and so passing through Meryton , thought she might as well call on you .	17.075891435265323
After a slight preparation for good news , the letter was read aloud .	33.901708919190966
Oh , yes .	563.6727655721099
From the very beginning , from the first moment I may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form that ground-work of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike ;	6.970291099321289
My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers .	67.87143848109898
Jane will be quite an old maid soon , I declare .	52.258938204464044
Nothing , on the contrary , could be more natural ;	68.5619810703814
Yes ;	4459.007412392422
Elizabeth was shocked to think that , however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself , the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal !	10.012148134405797
It had come with a fare from London ;	66.38178162500989
Then , the two third he danced with Miss King , and the two fourth with Maria Lucas , and the two fifth with Jane again , and the two sixth with Lizzy , and the Boulanger If he had had any compassion for me , cried her husband impatiently , he would not have danced half so much !	9.144291829768138
When breakfast was over , they were joined by the sisters ;	51.116498027335126
She did indeed , Louisa .	224.87856661009198
Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London ;	22.482623458811457
No said Darcy , I have made no such pretension .	85.97833503109744
CHAPTER IV .	1311.7971600904
For , though your accusations were ill-founded , formed on mistaken premises , my behaviour to you at the time , had merited the severest reproof .	11.280894387769413
lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table , after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter ;	17.220073777119264
It was Collins's picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened ;	29.906953081901634
But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities , replied her uncle .	38.5708762929891
Do you not consider that a connection with you , must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody ?	22.33751695861464
My dear Bennet , cried his wife , what are you talking of ?	34.922351079705344
Lydia was a stout , well-grown girl of fifteen , with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance ;	16.939412993885586
It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire .	50.34635669189213
To be sure London was rather thin , but however the little Theatre was open .	21.657049825920517
She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded ;	16.948476714152843
My mother was in hysterics , and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power , I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done !	15.012164238986882
Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room , and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from Bingley by a housemaid , and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters .	9.750599432054338
His revenge would have been complete indeed .	95.59838081629205
I could hardly keep my countenance .	137.1207132245421
Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes .	21.253918462329757
She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent , without remembering that his cousin was to go with him ;	26.27047598182391
Elizabeth's misery increased , at such unnecessary , such officious attention !	35.608420762883405
He resigned all claim to assistance in the church , were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it , and accepted in return three thousand pounds .	12.529703457034026
As for myself , it is many , many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner .	21.60058147577113
That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary ;	16.26346251102588
when she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage , the difference , the change was so great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible .	8.423537510798706
That is all settled ;	317.1998152138008
till the latter walked away from her , and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano-forte , stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's countenance .	10.30630969795767
You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters ;	20.986157944797572
And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself ?	44.8662104394654
I do not blame Jane , she continued , for Jane would have got Bingley , if she could .	32.69982928049919

I am astonished , my dear , said Bennet , that you should be so ready to think your own children silly .	19.816498822745633
The effect was immediate .	272.284989900432
Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth ;	36.39064593225456
Not that I think Charlotte so very plain but then she is our particular friend .	21.482850959577018
Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine , and his kind intention of christening , marrying , and burying his parishioners whenever it were required .	9.844963221690668
You are quite right .	283.3911415192215
but now , as Bingley's friend and your husband , there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me .	17.24210558551694
Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ;	13.297305070023473
I wish you had been there , my dear , to have given him one of your set downs .	29.211499831893885
but you must own she is very plain .	92.57893381335121
but attended with all that embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior , the belief of her being proud and reserved .	8.900704548008651
In revolving lady Catherine's expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference .	12.267830987200924
With a book he was regardless of time ;	74.29307926076336
Their sister's wedding day arrived ;	158.14926912035637
Wickham began to speak on more general topics , Meryton , the neighbourhood , the society , appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen , and speaking of the latter especially , with gentle but very intelligible gallantry .	11.370538729924247
Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters .	24.705154750880503
This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be ;	30.128929261397168
and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better .	37.27465575846129
though I doubt whether his reserve , or anybody's reserve , can be answerable for the event .	25.41668542675631
In a few days more , we may gain some news of them , and till we know that they are not married , and have no design of marrying , do not let us give the matter over as lost .	11.129734554941916
and I wish with all my heart it may prove so ;	37.247343001419395
The younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done ;	15.283301617830459
And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Forster , the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me .	12.55301557498616
She answered him with cold civility .	122.44709857332509
If , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise , should come to his friend within a few days , she added , I shall know how to understand it .	12.986350692306084
But I will not repine .	220.45862783873713
Bingley will not be detained in London by them .	71.99907970049603
We were always encouraged to read , and had all the masters that were necessary .	27.969606682740263
so far we are equal .	260.344469596036
I was angry perhaps at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper direction .	21.990892059957933
yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet .	28.538541833333923
She burst into tears as she alluded to it , and for a few minutes could not speak another word .	20.380276342492902

and the evening , though as it passed it seemed long , was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion ;	16.71346969901382
for Bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken , and Lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , boisterously exclaimed , Good Lord !	10.842998599927192
Is not it so , Bennet ?	213.2039124876342
and I never saw such happy manners !	96.07023805647928
You will only think I feel more than I ought to do , when I tell you all .	25.65520455074213
We may as well wait , perhaps , till the circumstance occurs , before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon .	13.571911235692824
Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion ( unasked too ) on this subject ;	18.235002221914762
Your examination of Darcy is over , I presume , said Miss Bingley ;	42.866333874838546
He spoke of apprehension and anxiety , but his countenance expressed real security .	25.07575512726292
it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome .	54.87440323807462
You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane .	50.90548661461802
As her successor in that house , she regarded her with jealous abhorrence .	34.05136047458103
But what does he say of the living ?	78.83355717457125
E8 or 1 .	498.9058211592206
Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice , which on every other subject shall be my constant guide , though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself .	5.76145348702918
that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place , and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Morris immediately ;	13.442116653867817
1 .	4079.0161042043856
They were more disturbed , more unequal , than she had often seen them .	25.96843249508825
and Darcy had much better finish his letter .	76.31670000020176
It is natural that obligation should be felt , and if I could feel gratitude , I would now thank you .	18.649457812961774
They are going to be encamped near Brighton ;	83.1010646087412
If you have not been mistaken here , I must have been in an error .	46.490991261972546
1 .	4079.0161042043856
The rain continued the whole evening without intermission ;	63.124864241569696
You have employed your time much better .	74.51875536280582
She saw all the glories of the camp ;	103.0834394850541
My dear , you flatter me .	138.2520271340245

Nobody wants him to come .	259.1959316498855
but she had her share of business as well as her aunt , and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in Lambton , with false excuses for their sudden departure .	10.956693533294091
The church ought to have been my profession I was brought up for the church , and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living , had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now .	10.420791167875377
Let me take it in the best light , in the light in which it may be understood .	28.561700988941286
Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet , and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body , went away .	11.937163883876124
E8 or 1 .	498.9058211592206
thought she .	2255.05450891107
and as that left too short a period for them to go so far , and see so much as they had proposed , or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on , they were obliged to give up the Lakes , and substitute a more contracted tour ;	9.915223687255326
she cried .	1471.656537186322
Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry , but could only force one most reluctant smile .	18.045506163740587
Yes ;	4459.007412392422
I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind .	27.353481733625625
said she .	1724.8475078893864
The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence , or frightened by his high and imposing manners , and sees him only as he chuses to be seen .	11.996813254101422
I advise Darcy , and Lizzy , and Kitty , said Bennet , to walk to Oakham Mount this morning .	34.20111686710254
and immediately , though not very fluently , gave him to understand , that her sentiments had undergone so material a change , since the period to which he alluded , as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure , his present assurances .	8.197974540192034
To the rest of the family they paid little attention ;	44.53650876899724
That they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice !	13.657970614422547
For my part , I am inclined to believe it all Darcy's , but you shall do as you chuse .	21.669517690761243
She was met in the vestibule by Lydia , who , flying to her , cried in a half whisper , I am glad you are come , for there is such fun here !	13.669616985099077
But enough of this .	462.25278150079146
Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's interruption , and promised that it should not occur again , if he would resume his book ;	14.34361031733794
She was still very poorly , and Elizabeth would not quit her at all , till late in the evening , when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep , and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself .	9.854027086638943
This he considered sufficient encouragement , and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her , immediately followed .	18.73131431064615
She was a little revived , however , by his bringing back his coffee cup himself ;	22.259592108175887
Except , thought Elizabeth , when she goes to Ramsgate .	48.724481296099064
Can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand ?	36.244647610368695
Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday ;	28.218040343340906
But now she would no longer conceal from her , his share in Lydia's marriage .	30.345479762706166
yes it would be much better to wait till Jane was well , and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again .	14.578394508790332
It was too early in the morning for visitors , and besides , the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours .	22.072404705241876
and however bare of news the country in general might be , they always contrived to learn some from their aunt .	16.29330969179153
and their mother talked on , of her dislike of Darcy , and her resolution to be civil to him only as Bingley's friend , without being heard by either of them .	15.571623894262077
for on entering that place they removed into a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom .	9.479394461772376
The loo table , however , did not appear .	82.29096485758501
which brought them again , after some time , in a descent among hanging woods , to the edge of the water , in one of its narrowest parts .	17.273420498145555
and the other , how I am ever to pay him .	64.24304972461256
but when the servants were withdrawn , he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest , and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine , by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness .	10.887350835305451
You know , sister , we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it .	25.88628866853403
He readily agreed to it .	187.41217006831954
I am afraid you will not be able to make it out , but I hardly know what I have written .	24.951893544046445
She will be married at sixteen !	147.8648013452389
and she was , in fact , almost engrossed by her nephews , speaking to them , especially to Darcy , much more than to any other person in the room .	15.326637187978898
But you will know it , when I have told you what happened the very next day .	30.3101842041174
Lady Catherine , Sir William , and and Collins sat down to quadrille ;	43.37725365786273
Another day I will do the same ;	125.18189626456093
Be assured , my dear Sir , that Collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you , and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the bitterest kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove .	10.378479287531484
It is from my cousin , Collins , who , when I am dead , may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases .	15.0274023159218
Oh !	3082.833849588038
I am by no means of opinion , I assure you , said he , that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ;	10.873302287024579
Adieu to disappointment and spleen .	135.16552149551865
Let her go then .	293.6621575975771
He concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which , in spite of all his endeavours , he had found impossible to conquer ;	14.1691120967931
The sanguine hope of good , however , which the benevolence of her heart suggested , had not yet deserted her ;	21.0026271845466
but unable to waste such a precious occasion , she suddenly got up , and saying to Kitty , Come here , my love , I want to speak to you , took her out of the room .	13.047481745174919
Now and then , they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship , and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits .	14.514361927934168
I am perfectly ready , I assure you , to keep my engagement ;	44.902404013809075
and Bingley's large fortune , the mention of which gave animation to their mother , was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign .	13.258836087706893
If , as I conclude will be the case , you send me full powers to act in your name , throughout the whole of this business , I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement .	8.264131025650101
If you mention my name at the Bell , you will be attended to .	28.35796695112397
and Collins having been in waiting near the lodges , to make them his parting obeisance , was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence , of their appearing in very good health , and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected , after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings .	6.467085217160257
Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all , and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet , with great pleasure .	15.98665316007046
and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing her into Derbyshire , had been the means of uniting them .	13.698228829305085
I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies ( if such young ladies there are ) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time .	7.9227235321937135
Vanity and pride are different things , though the words are often used synonimously .	21.343478474119486
CHAPTER VI .	1311.7971600904
and I think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all , and very hypocritical .	36.68215245553728
I only hope they may have half my good luck .	37.31103481913997
For though elated by his rank , it did not render him supercilious ;	29.646192767814966
You and the girls may go , or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better , for as you are as handsome as any of them , Bingley might like you the best of the party .	12.273133672535387
Her prudent mother , occupied by the same ideas , forbore to invite him to sit by herself .	18.356021145748336
He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship , replied Elizabeth with emphasis , and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life .	15.041161491347898
stay where you are .	386.52555345663495
Pray , my dear aunt , what is the difference in matrimonial affairs , between the mercenary and the prudent motive ?	16.368285639571678
and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long , that even Bingley's good humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone .	11.61016567493326
But now it comes out .	137.5455585308715
she comes here to-morrow with him .	111.44167898382092
Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us .	43.632020856883116
cried Elizabeth when she had finished it .	110.69649665032495
In understanding Darcy was the superior .	171.4024349028546
Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend , that had attended her from that part of the world .	19.80411941432799
the ladies drove on , and the others returned into the house .	51.311632695818105
My dear aunt , this is being serious indeed .	50.631612132858415
but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him .	37.98556771440603
Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding ;	37.791735403124484
Elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to confirm his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself ;	8.07674319343838
When Denny , and Wickham , and Pratt , and two or three more of the men came in , they did not know him in the least .	24.766331280896402

her features , though not plain , were insignificant ;	71.40442868677907
their father was in neither ;	326.60374334281516
But against this , there were objections ;	121.30545437498984
Darcy was almost as far from her , as the table could divide them .	41.8016882185104
But she is very young ;	257.6258020597229
but was too angry with Lydia , to send any message to her .	44.077392365712576
but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody ;	16.172703438799175
Bingley was by no means deficient , but Darcy was clever .	43.21317087340493
The introduction , however , was immediately made ;	92.88515257034716
You must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention ;	22.420979039675128
Nothing could console and nothing appease her .	68.65822533296569
Bingley .	6924.455086512006
At present I will say nothing about it .	66.06789442305495
but what could set you off in the first place ?	58.52896512837549
but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane ;	18.54963603197857
The loss of her daughter made Bennet very dull for several days .	29.015078895501617
and , while examining the nearer aspect of the house , all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned .	16.068379246482408
several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle , a private had been flogged , and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married .	14.243943736505488
and to her it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first , and was in a way to be very much in love ;	18.362452867653747
There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name .	26.142203242497306
In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ;	8.679576107864024
she cried : This is delightful indeed !	78.62250475813664
In town I believe he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence , and being now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and dissipation .	9.25566669418936
said she , as she looked in her face .	100.39841199986805
This fine account of him , whispered her aunt , as they walked , is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend .	16.57986269695215
Young women should always be properly guarded and attended , according to their situation in life .	14.627550092216897
not deficient in good humour when they were pleased , nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it ;	18.33987586852602
Complied with !	1571.4439182596846
Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey , and as she did not answer them all herself , attention was necessary , which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her ;	11.562291860682338
but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters .	37.488137184909526
are quite well .	723.2199482660386
Oh !	3082.833849588038
I grieve to find , however , that Colonel F is not disposed to depend upon their marriage ;	24.14753421939877
and if I had my will , we should .	80.01433678970604
Why will you think so ?	210.20327505077665
and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on the renewal of his addresses .	9.206216229403939
I might as well enquire , replied she , why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ?	8.84822327028536
I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here .	8.998402199990663
who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister , and gratified my vanity , in useless or blameable distrust .	15.97630186025399
Jane heard them with horror .	183.03175262305496
My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family , and if my manner has been at all reprehensible , I here beg leave to apologise .	10.657465485279854
She enquired into Charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly and minutely , and gave her a great deal of advice , as to the management of them all ;	12.381399480069827
I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party .	21.059309699460712
Attention , forbearance , patience with Darcy , was injury to Wickham .	35.40505328241967
and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must produce , found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business .	10.222365990407976
so genteel and so easy !	225.00312389401725
Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to the piano-forte , and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way , which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived , she seated herself .	10.891996083265832
Oh !	3082.833849588038
Though Lydia's short letter to F gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green , something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W never intended to go there , or to marry Lydia at all , which was repeated to Colonel F who instantly taking the alarm , set off from B intending to trace their route .	4.88869186054645
She stared , coloured , doubted , and was silent .	42.90075563217049
and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person ( Lady Lucas ) freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Bingley .	8.735354139975353
I , who have valued myself on my abilities !	64.85524541808246
I wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind .	26.238797458585136
He was seriously concerned , that a cause of so little advantage to any one , should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law , and he was determined , if possible , to find out the extent of his assistance , and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could .	10.595586707128307
She will make him a very proper wife .	104.75294091157814
But depend upon it , Collins , she added , that Lizzy shall be brought to reason .	27.54581734697756
He comes down on Thursday at the latest , very likely on Wednesday .	26.917121072648026
Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is .	21.916086342404284
What do you think has happened this morning ?	60.05166873645855
She was gone directly .	319.0639651484174
Elizabeth was forced to go .	223.0361703082297
and when your sister is recovered , you shall if you please name the very day of the ball .	20.563706496821098
and Darcy , after looking at her for a moment , turned silently away .	40.67276384812802
He was full of joy and attention .	74.75890373971083
He looked serious as usual ;	155.4155098577926
nay , which has already arisen from it , I am sure you would judge differently in the affair .	23.820807506903595
Lydia laughed , and said , Aye , that is just like your formality and discretion .	27.389479522970436
Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister ;	18.812712998741098
In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man !	21.23072424875955
When all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at Pemberley ;	29.38599834445067
Yes ;	4459.007412392422
As soon as Jane had read Gardiner's hope of Lydia's being soon married , her joy burst forth , and every following sentence added to its exuberance .	11.228895399103012
Jane's temper was not desponding , and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart .	10.926654587035937
We may as well leave them by themselves you know ;	40.40871710185446
Elizabeth replied that it was .	260.2833025025479
The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning ;	62.85956342352996
any thing was a welcome relief to him at Rosings ;	97.26784391746898
Much more rational , my dear Caroline , I dare say , but it would not be near so much like a ball .	18.554865080898182
What do you mean ?	287.92481755237094
However , I did not hear above one word in ten , for I was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear Wickham .	20.349349657577697
A carat character is used to denote superscription .	53.86196148212465
He has not an ill-natured look .	139.9136226461096
What could your ladyship propose by it ?	71.6080291663841
In Three Volumes .	470.00017296925205
with tears and lamentations of regret , invectives against the villanous conduct of Wickham , and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage ;	11.743941121895395
They insist also on my seeing Jones therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me and excepting a sore-throat and head-ache there is not much the matter with me .	10.051445849981612
But such as they were , it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them , and what a contrariety of emotion they excited .	12.683453325706802
Jane had not been gone long before it rained hard .	44.20532071752245
but I am sure I never saw any thing of it .	44.253219348389415
Reynolds's respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master .	22.515851098628744
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ?	100.4204524667388
They saw much to interest , but nothing to justify enquiry .	44.808115911034264
cried Miss Bingley .	723.0206267491144
but she did weep from vexation and envy .	54.93206952070288
Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight .	59.44347234384331

Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister .	39.64311103669436
and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle , so I was determined he should know it , and so I let down the side glass next to him , and took off my glove , and let my hand just rest upon the window frame , so that he might see the ring , and then I bowed and smiled like any thing .	6.647740052943376
I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression .	52.82223304981792
Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish , self reproach , she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness .	13.12268421586729
but as he took up his abode with the Lucases , his arrival was no great inconvenience to Bennet .	21.328289517435213
Lady Catherine then observed , Your father's estate is entailed on Collins , I think .	21.956367848945497
Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort ;	18.407660652988618
Collins has made an offer to Lizzy , and she will not have him .	43.1279655858133
I think there cannot be too little said on the subject .	39.94147987555845
and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Darcy's looks and behaviour .	13.67475402599988
and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her .	26.681815561279723
I thank you for explaining it so fully .	62.121281316773604
She cared for none of her friends , she wanted no help of his , she would not hear of leaving Wickham .	21.657258703582162
Thank Heaven !	1459.6468769151008
YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION , THE TRADEMARK OWNER , AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL , DIRECT , INDIRECT , CONSEQUENTIAL , PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE .	2.486549253852801
but he will vouch for the good conduct , the probity and honour of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that Wickham has deserved much less attention from Darcy than he has received ;	12.925673495115293

That is not very likely ;	303.0268119145645
At present I will not say more , but perhaps when we are better acquainted He was interrupted by a summons to dinner ;	16.233941588323578
But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill .	51.387928198488
one , that Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief ;	75.82924859007268
Elizabeth , after slightly surveying it , went to a window to enjoy its prospect .	28.009623169233496
What can be the meaning of this !	140.11632681222608
What is Darcy to me , pray , that I should be afraid of him ?	39.13272214077252
I assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town .	27.19360058145307
Obstinate , headstrong girl !	254.8221331647736
for certainly , there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction .	27.135610676852114
It now first struck her , that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage , and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings , in the absence of more eligible visitors .	7.609767822662252
Certainly not ;	1638.3982232705066
You could not make me happy , and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who would make you so .	21.90437713936413
Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice .	56.28332346208669
The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information , was as sincere as her brother's in sending it .	13.830063813838484
I thank you for my share of the favour , said Elizabeth ;	53.0685529753663
I have nothing either to hope or fear , and nothing to reproach him with .	28.919103699856034
At present I am not in love with Wickham ;	81.33108669745386
It is only that he has better means of having it than many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor .	14.905301951460434
and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked Darcy before they had known any thing of the matter .	19.09743766905209
but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them .	24.408089258113655
I have by no means done .	129.9432425786984
That is not an unnatural surmise , said Fitzwilliam , but it is lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly .	15.783711293545146
all that his library afforded .	338.9377419423187
The commendation bestowed on him by Reynolds was of no trifling nature .	25.99617825226747
You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them .	45.47419318502826
But let me advise you to think better of it .	58.69072241717699
You excel so much in the dance , Miss Eliza , that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you ;	19.67756351590563
MY DEAR BROTHER , At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece , and such as , upon the whole , I hope will give you satisfaction .	12.817597516520758
Thank you , said Lydia , for if you did , I should certainly tell you all , and then Wickham would be angry .	25.919963312831698
In Three Volumes .	470.00017296925205
I know no harm of her .	142.1002927991288
Then , who taught you ?	237.2055843883272
I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary .	56.098305437655576
and though he belonged to one of the universities , he had merely kept the necessary terms , without forming at it any useful acquaintance .	10.71532844198183
He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily postponed seeing him , till after the departure of the former .	13.892929751060521
Such a charming man !	335.72001937414086
His pride , said Miss Lucas , does not offend me so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it .	14.855377558772364
thought Elizabeth .	1896.4059616932782
In a few minutes , Bennet half opened the door and called out , Lizzy , my dear , I want to speak with you .	15.73126742563963
But Lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me .	37.614710091187256
You may depend upon my seeking no further .	49.88220084728722
but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Philips , and was , by her watchfulness , most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin .	11.230278297061078
As yet , she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its reasonableness .	27.566983598007564
I should as soon call her mother a wit .	63.792055928776364
We will be down as soon as we can , said Jane ;	53.18815863448195
This must be the grossest falsehood !	150.95306238853277
Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before , how many years longer Bennet was likely to live ;	12.618561812074274
Collins then returned to Elizabeth .	244.9610153617661
Yes ;	4459.007412392422
Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene , and could observe the three ladies before her composedly .	22.399210114110474
and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Collins , was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house , as soon as Bennet were dead .	12.154086899897612
And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother ?	80.19632698303907
Miss Eliza Bennet , said Miss Bingley , despises cards .	62.78086031592168
that as to fortune , it is a most eligible match ;	64.71651428857521
and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister's , Wickham is by no means a respectable young man .	14.336379434929775
Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour , till Sir William thus began .	9.305635283566648
What could be more natural than his asking you again ?	48.70144619125278
Certain it is , that the living became vacant two years ago , exactly as I was of an age to hold it , and that it was given to another man ;	14.889069789564145
I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh , and of her mother Lady Catherine .	11.269657786475756
Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition .	77.09383050755285
I shall send this by express , that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer .	15.407475832259577
He is certainly a good brother , said Elizabeth , as she walked towards one of the windows .	30.342918881119353
If you'll believe me , I did not once put my foot out of doors , though I was there a fortnight .	17.56217500656436
And it is the more to be lamented , because there is reason to suppose , as my dear Charlotte informs me , that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter , has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence , though , at the same time , for the consolation of yourself and Bennet , I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an enormity , at so early an age .	7.978499775183138
and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn , and of her stay in Derbyshire , so often , and in so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts .	13.926118828540131
but at the same time , there was no one , whose knowledge of a sister's frailty would have mortified her so much .	22.471049417117356
My father and mother believe the worst , but I cannot think so ill of him .	20.678629932531663
Wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we have thought him ;	46.74899277416436
Ten thousand pounds !	816.0220615049144
I do assure you , Sir , that I have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man .	10.931579388607156
But as to your other objection , I am afraid it will hardly hold good .	31.606298731988172
Yet now I must believe you , cried Jane .	71.66690188779467
and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself .	18.642630624585387
She has no money , no connections , nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for ever .	17.192313228079843
In seeing Bingley , her thoughts naturally flew to her sister ;	53.54474907812948
Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match ;	80.2484291235094
A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood , since you went away .	24.78623445720484
I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude ;	44.69560068276459
and though Philips , as well as her sister , stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good humour encouraged , yet , whenever she did speak , she must be vulgar .	11.054545430941749
Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family , they did not attempt to oppose it , for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants , while they waited at table , and judged it better that one only of the household , and the one whom they could most trust , should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject .	6.794643319722992
It was only said , 'Lately , George Wickham , Esq .	42.35620317564456
It will be her turn soon to be teazed , said Miss Lucas .	42.5166366381926
Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one ;	57.34638557755913
We accordingly went and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend , the certain evils of such a choice .	13.478292142756752
Indeed he has no improper pride .	139.50556013855453
and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane , and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do .	15.405582625313063
There is something a little stately in him to be sure , replied her aunt , but it is confined to his air , and is not unbecoming .	19.48644465229438
By Elizabeth's instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband , which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself .	9.849634601546505
From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent .	99.34454948666543
I shall not say that you are mistaken , he replied , because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ;	17.626033687308535
Blame you !	1592.1098756399153
She will be married !	442.67652117371
Is he married or single ?	135.88860981689274
but she sat down , resolving within herself , to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man .	13.634909501846451
And with regard to the resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the former were excited by his marrying me , it would not give me one moment's concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn .	10.90146039329694
She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject , and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect .	13.752697826722052
The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister , will prove what she felt .	28.564440386264728
I am the less surprised at what has happened , replied Sir William , from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire .	9.549816536528013
If you are redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase Project Gutenberg associated with or appearing on the work , you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1 .	9.358049441060595
I did not think Caroline in spirits , were her words , but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London .	14.002268555457237
That reply will do for the present .	120.39865966341769
But , unluckily for her ladyship , its effect had been exactly contrariwise .	30.730836503182267
Their parties abroad were less varied than before ;	42.36933364448156
The indirect boast ;	606.5746127066452
Till I was in Kent , and saw so much both of Darcy and his relation , Colonel Fitzwilliam , I was ignorant of the truth myself .	21.338682560481534
cried Elizabeth .	1373.851020902062
YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE , STRICT LIABILITY , BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1 .	4.567101527837613
But she had no reason to fear and Gardiner's curiosity ;	44.684596814213
Collins , however , was not discouraged from speaking again , and Darcy's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech , and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way .	10.269508812427569
but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley's inattention .	44.539082536148335
Presuming , however , that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment , than any dislike of the proposal , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of society , a perfect willingness to accept it , she ventured to engage for her attendance , and the day after the next was fixed on .	9.792346558112019
Indeed , Eliza , you will be as welcome to me as either of them .	29.462302377356558
for on the very morning after their own arrival at Lambton , these visitors came .	24.55604572602074
This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ;	16.20131845617892
safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune .	87.01731034041664
What is your own opinion ?	286.2448086127858
and Bennet , who could by no means wish for so speedy a return , immediately said , But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here , my good sir ?	9.799226466374895
He meant to provide for me amply , and thought he had done it ;	42.27521728624688
To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew ;	19.378819665728063
If I were not afraid of judging harshly , I should be almost tempted to say , that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this .	14.659115193093294
And , my dear Jane , I never saw you look in greater beauty .	31.31413005038734
His misfortunes !	1574.4218572142372
The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt .	35.15723689986112
and had this led to no suspicion , the faces of both as they hastily turned round , and moved away from each other , would have told it all .	10.95126379674917
6 .	6847.919774710029
How much I shall have to tell !	142.87881743999858
and whatever he did , done gracefully .	78.28061532960079
It was a large , well-proportioned room , handsomely fitted up .	33.1508789790768
She sat intently at work , striving to be composed , and without daring to lift up her eyes , till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister , as the servant was approaching the door .	9.877852609097177
They entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds ;	19.227883377187112
but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome .	49.057821116188755
A place too , with which so many of your acquaintance are connected .	37.826172243872875
and in spite of every thing , was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune .	16.407290873589506
Take care , Lizzy ;	398.2266553199478
And this , said she , is the end of all his friend's anxious circumspection !	37.34596721133189
for that will have more weight in the argument , Miss Bennet , than you may be aware of .	30.69519317708132
assuring him that Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ;	11.434593923160163
when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet , she turned suddenly towards him and said , By the bye , Charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield ?	9.282646863362737
She looked at Jane , to see how she bore it ;	53.46099311365154
I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which I am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before .	9.48773101714049
If one could but go to Brighton !	81.06724876805036
and Elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject .	38.27754864284602
She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley .	54.93053911608414
the gentlemen being out , they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere .	42.12404497800054
Gardiner , to whom the chief of this news had been given before , in the course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with her , made her sister a slight answer , and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation .	12.322855603585396
Let me write for you , said Jane , if you dislike the trouble yourself .	32.766486445867905
The happiness which this reply produced , was such as he had probably never felt before ;	24.664234566565572
And , above all things , keep Bennet from fighting .	33.833261130498634
Oh !	3082.833849588038
I never heard any harm of her ;	96.65344908875987
By supposing such an affection , you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong , and me most unhappy .	20.74385757965382
I can recal nothing worse .	160.0038462978678
Their lodgings were not long a secret , and at length they began to know the officers themselves .	26.53622463819625
I like her appearance , said Elizabeth , struck with other ideas .	38.46369996280368
We had better go into the avenue .	93.96175381033322
I am prodigiously proud of him .	105.3146533269851
and it was not wholly without foundation .	90.18120189474985
Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune , which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day .	8.59262347200466
Those who chose to be idle , certainly might .	58.58772182127269
You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble ;	13.250864028185413
To Jane herself , she exclaimed , there could be no possibility of objection .	35.646340378830224
It was all conjecture .	301.72597811061524
Elizabeth merely curtseyed to him , without saying a word .	50.37133795046988
You taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous .	22.469197129077173
but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected .	37.69974923022562
and nothing therefore remained to be done , but to think well of them both , to defend the conduct of each , and throw into the account of accident or mistake , whatever could not be otherwise explained .	11.861179521346653
What is there of good to be expected ?	101.01531411554264
It is what every body says .	138.55321120717633
Every body is disgusted with his pride .	96.71579798561501
said her sister .	877.0022445977523
and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield , I should probably be off in five minutes .	21.21621260784488
adding , that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it .	27.023481182316093
When I am in company with him , I will not be wishing .	54.55134688429882
His surprise was great .	288.46950301933396
and they have another , who lives somewhere near Cheapside .	47.539926894159294
At length , however , his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family .	16.834540665386992
Of a fine , stout , healthy love it may .	34.7990927240629
She remembered also , that till the Netherfield family had quitted the country , he had told his story to no one but herself ;	15.236041107249266
I am not ashamed of having been mistaken or , at least , it is slight , it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters .	11.809067910233855
She shall hear my opinion .	174.28215276849986
It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ;	21.802219021678496
I am far from attributing any part of Bingley's conduct to design , said Elizabeth ;	21.37755721555722
The second began .	562.575086242826
This is a wretched beginning indeed !	127.35059642778747
a favourite with her mother , whose affection had brought her into public at an early age .	21.742492080059137
I am so happy .	308.21699120975296
He stood by her , however , for some minutes , in silence ;	59.38813773530049
She will be taken good care of .	96.29461532263777
I should like to know how he behaves among strangers .	49.42840736266046
Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Wickham .	23.9474126900767
Yes certainly .	1575.5518852451594
Your's , c .	487.4441142809693
Poor dear child !	556.0601261702571
Your sister I also watched .	153.08059401481015
The sisters , on hearing this , repeated three or four times how much they were grieved , how shocking it was to have a bad cold , and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves ;	9.399879018075671
For the last week they had seen very little of either Lady Catherine or her daughter .	29.857881903797463
If that had been nearer , she would not have gone so soon .	48.39177204263863
It is nearly fifty miles .	146.4755662917454
Seriously , however , she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's concurrence .	20.603733943853946
Very , very much .	421.5624712504465
Charlotte did not stay much longer , and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard .	25.234188945301142
for as to Darcy's using him ill , it is perfectly false ;	37.931493520287084
Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit , but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it .	17.076122548922655
A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant ;	16.37514276226551
and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects .	63.81420294427723
Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think , without feeling that she had been blind , partial , prejudiced , absurd .	11.611131205756385
She was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when .	25.352487740762296
Her affections had been continually fluctuating , but never without an object .	36.28018143166397
You are joking , Lizzy .	176.29901946076814
You dislike an argument , and want to silence this .	49.748871385162936
Darcy , who was leaning against the mantle-piece with his eyes fixed on her face , seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise .	11.260192838324128
My dear Madam , he replied , this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what I have been hoping to receive ;	16.80031092214977
Ring the bell , Kitty , for Hill .	89.6034217911503
He was always to have gone on Saturday , and to Saturday he still meant to stay .	24.34371996752269
Believe me , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that your modesty , so far from doing you any disservice , rather adds to your other perfections .	12.843235448464645
The gentlemen arrived early ;	249.68643664263888
How is such a man to be worked on ?	88.16526892138008
Merely to the illustration of your character , said she , endeavouring to shake off her gravity .	22.491109558022092
and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned , and preparing her to be surprised , she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Darcy and herself .	12.906270248655044
but I am afraid of alarming you be assured that we are all well .	28.834852297068906
I am , said he , with a firm voice .	54.32169581226469
Let her be called down .	165.60707679113864
It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first .	15.670691353564854
Removed !	6847.919774710029
In the first place , she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter ;	37.458665447949144
My dear , dear Lydia !	191.41015650860274
Impossible .	6847.919774710029
Reynolds could interest her on no other point .	61.732536497961846
Is this , thought Elizabeth , meant for me ?	79.5094167546813
and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves , and meanly of others .	23.60079293195086
and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration of her , of her former favourite George Wickham ;	16.059576381492445
He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate , generous heart in the world ;	16.440415931721237
and after observing that he was a very gentleman-like man , asked her how she had liked him .	25.960470429330304
To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either .	31.669608769771404
Do you play and sing , Miss Bennet ?	64.17252315814919
No principle of either , would be violated by my marriage with Darcy .	28.8129535264162
You will be censured , slighted , and despised , by every one connected with him .	25.905790623556427
Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural ;	11.913250781354419
Aye , so it is , cried her mother , and Long does not come back till the day before ;	27.732854764953505
With all my heart ;	350.0911656875783
on his side even more .	226.3464441535536
Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality , especially on Lydia's side , but nothing to give him any alarm .	14.405848385028714
His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage , for Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane , in order to have the earliest assurance of it ;	9.693862540853873
But she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow .	33.8848319219755
my last letter had never reached her .	97.39099433411252
I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford .	19.65361758795802
Oh , my dear Lizzy !	269.52261208041347
He was well , but so much engaged with Darcy , that they scarcely ever saw him .	36.061074102458626
but , instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to Miss Bennet , I beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so I took the liberty of coming to ask .	9.734552524761314
but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic .	38.44631711827724
for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement , they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning , from all those who were not immediately on the spot .	9.481397045701646
After pausing on this point a considerable while , she once more continued to read .	25.256486841214972
and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her .	36.620952423063905
Her own thoughts were employing her .	99.16892269886227
1 .	4079.0161042043856
and his attachment to Wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me , to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow , and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant .	8.641935227388073
Mary would not understand them ;	235.46742410837157
The situation of your mother's family , though objectionable , was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently , so almost uniformly betrayed by herself , by your three younger sisters , and occasionally even by your father .	8.854257164496001
The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Bennet's visit , and determining when they should ask him to dinner .	12.771910250397143
The country is a vast deal pleasanter , is not it , Bingley ?	40.019087438293596
I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man , without having a wish beyond it .	10.604342625549693
and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct , who will believe me ?	24.85072719706948
Smiles decked the face of Bennet , as the carriage drove up to the door ;	30.983511260816798
When convinced on that article , Miss Bennet had nothing farther to wish .	31.949505105999187
and Bennet , in the meanwhile , was giving way to all the happy schemes , which the good humour , and common politeness of Bingley , in half an hour's visit , had revived .	15.565579940681245
But her conclusion was false ;	135.20466597004233
yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Gardiner thought of him , and Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's beginning the subject .	16.80591003408872
No , she would go home .	199.91402029427888
No , never .	674.6809634192565
He is a pleasant fellow , and would jilt you creditably .	43.17680959152714
Jane had been a week in town , without either seeing or hearing from Caroline .	28.8308663627858
for though feeling almost secure , and with reason , for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging , he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday .	12.143964759516956
Well , then supposing them to be in London .	74.48214378765128
Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related .	78.08193746017977
The apothecary came , and having examined his patient , said , as might be supposed , that she had caught a violent cold , and that they must endeavour to get the better of it ;	13.725998322136382
Teazing , teazing , man !	137.6820944515971
and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Wickham's attentions .	40.97747471905594
I was right , therefore ;	271.2471475522309
I pity you , Miss Eliza , for this discovery of your favourite's guilt ;	35.35586328121972
and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see .	38.68327117459435
They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday ;	65.298894932096
It was exactly a scene , and exactly among people , where he had apparently least to do , and least temptation to go .	16.77660220611434
The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade , and within view of his own warehouses , could have been so well bred and agreeable .	12.590678847343737
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule .	22.34445442039533
My mind however is now made up on the subject , for having received ordination at Easter , I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh , widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh , whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish , where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship , and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church of England .	4.800475041931701
No ;	5515.523422156578
I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude .	18.074701366248977
The general prejudice against Darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton , to attempt to place him in an amiable light .	11.910758319957667
and as for Purvis Lodge , the attics are dreadful .	40.45125026740112
When Bennet was told of this , she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected , considering what her anxiety for his life had been before .	15.711633318160494
He spoke of it as a certain event , of which the time alone could be undecided .	31.783002750689672
Elizabeth soon observed , and instantly understood it .	91.83420919610252
But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness , is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging .	20.73368292211272
You are too hasty , Sir , she cried .	60.84279679176378
What do you keep winking at me for ?	61.702647869724466
On the very last day of the regiment's remaining in Meryton , he dined with others of the officers at Longbourn ;	21.128866203241838
Wickham of course wanted more than he could get ;	70.72003215626455
Elizabeth was glad of it ;	224.46867425188796
she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes ;	62.14274315031524
but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry .	69.62242426388778
However little Darcy might have liked such an address , he contented himself with coolly replying , that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned , no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer .	8.66237097437034
and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too !	78.14976883382573
but the ladies were ready enough to talk , and Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement , nor inclined to be silent himself .	16.158606923802438
said Jane .	1762.3270042612578
You are very cautious , I suppose , as to its being created .	37.16826410074457
The feelings of the person who wrote , and the person who received it , are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circumstance attending it , ought to be forgotten .	12.360606200054512
My dearest Lizzy will , I am sure , be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment , at my expence , when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me .	9.7946807244823
though we can never be what we once were to each other .	35.63950409500267
in looking back to what they had feared , only two hours ago , she felt all the advantages of what they had gained .	16.430270931287406
Console Lady Catherine as well as you can .	116.52285302713688
Lizzy , said her father , I have given him my consent .	49.40784361260674
But good lord !	549.3466053105283
Hate you !	1592.1098756399153
I pity , though I cannot help blaming her .	71.84687201896676
He left Netherfield for London , on the day following , as you , I am certain , remember , with the design of soon returning .	18.178248855505267
His sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own ;	46.73690979052741
Darcy was fixed in astonishment .	189.37858801172558
But slyness seems the fashion .	135.20466597004233
Are you quite sure , Ma'am ?	131.49581695932912
As I did the other day , said Elizabeth , with a conscious smile ;	39.92079006941596
And is such a girl to be my nephew's sister ?	66.55591008635733
His anxiety for Jane was evident , and his attentions to herself most pleasing , and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others .	13.551107109605303
What I have to say relates to poor Lydia .	70.50546305137848
and though her resolution was not to be shaken , her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation .	25.329407535156363
Pray go to see them , with Sir William and Maria .	70.69089752789284
The only pain was in leaving her father , who would certainly miss her , and who , when it came to the point , so little liked her going , that he told her to write to him , and almost promised to answer her letter .	12.721154231820945
My dear Bennet , replied his wife , how can you be so tiresome !	34.420066626478956
Affectation of candour is common enough ;	83.57840920772502
of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt .	74.74591442616294
He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him , to lay his private actions open to the world .	13.59150359717304
The whole party have left Netherfield by this time , and are on their way to town ;	24.412639617774353
I know it to be impossible .	177.14593334138183
I have written to Colonel Forster , to inform him of our present arrangements , and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Wickham in and near Brighton , with assurances of speedy payment , for which I have pledged myself .	8.549211090258497
What , has she frightened away some of your lovers ?	52.44386531092007
You have no compassion on my poor nerves .	68.16364419458021
She wanted to hear of him , when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence .	32.0634201505174
Are not you curious to hear how it was managed ?	59.765375182332335
Poor Wickham ;	1611.8625692137662
for she had a lively , playful disposition , which delighted in any thing ridiculous .	34.36182753235034
What do you think ?	348.96961984567463
Her many attractions were again dwelt on , and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy , and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter .	10.576377082548182
She had instinctively turned away ;	169.92826703734178
Kitty , run down and order the carriage .	66.77047129910176
When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose , the tables were broke up , the carriage was offered to Collins , gratefully accepted , and immediately ordered .	11.30515282285327
I cannot blame myself for having done thus much .	46.62008746100625
Their situation was awkward enough ;	137.07738856302214
When you have killed all your own birds , Bingley , said her mother , I beg you will come here , and shoot as many as you please , on Bennet's manor .	13.110840394717606
and her expectations of advantage to her family , when in a happy humour , were so far beyond reason , that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day , to make his proposals .	12.69156242335309
Do not involve yourself , or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent .	14.597248750310419
There is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping , I dare say .	41.587045666342405
your name will never even be mentioned by any of us .	41.09761291714416
but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame .	50.665858024199885
Copyright laws in most countries are in a constant state of change .	30.04657776623243
Can it be possible that he will marry her ?	69.57315770219698
Oh , no .	794.9199107412481
Bennet replied that he had not .	199.2411754698224
But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister , or say half that remained to be said , for the present .	21.296675079037087
My dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts .	43.82597426567749
All that is known after this is , that they were seen to continue the London road .	21.130690372494822
Good gracious !	1373.0350778783054
You must learn some of my philosophy .	112.17831048204695
But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife , as I certainly did .	7.621276020148448
Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family ;	40.428528586221546
How shall we punish him for such a speech ?	55.61700562181898
and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house , walked quietly into it herself .	19.71274327948704
But wishes were vain ;	249.66958506366552
Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety ;	65.42836762343556
It ought to be good , he replied , it has been the work of many generations .	34.43448557393855
Lydia left a few lines for his wife , informing her of their intention .	31.19885039903613
His understanding and temper , though unlike her own , would have answered all her wishes .	29.071003530834947
But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about .	21.95123616635841
Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman , who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable .	20.224155586229397
He never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much ;	13.296386841949454
blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing .	16.042107234467302
She looked at her father to entreat his interference , lest Mary should be singing all night .	15.983001621740728
From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents .	41.31826078736438
1 .	4079.0161042043856
But however insincere you may choose to be , you shall not find me so .	32.52435368838169
I knew how it would be .	156.013944219825
Why , my dear , you must know , Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England ;	10.322382430628501
Perfectly so I thank you .	199.05784795979403
and the girls had the pleasure of hearing , as they entered the drawing-room , that Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation , and was then in the house .	16.881509689028363
repeated Darcy contemptuously ;	549.1421248858585
and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling , was more openly acknowledged , for she did not scruple to call out , What is that you are saying , Fitzwilliam ?	12.57777071545416
Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined .	58.92659101104494
but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ;	17.668173688330473
Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Collins and myself on this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of another : of which we have been advertised by the same authority .	7.674009579568476
and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love , and the object of that love , her friend Eliza , she sat herself seriously to work to find it out .	11.704937631664539
Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life ;	28.51826595437594
This is not quite enough to make her understand his character .	50.17282360775416
in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise , and where he was reduced to meet , frequently meet , reason with , persuade , and finally bribe , the man whom he always most wished to avoid , and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce .	8.945531539881609
You may ask questions , which I shall not choose to answer .	41.220650990646014
It is very unlucky ;	345.22322356010994
From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Darcy had been over-rated , Elizabeth had never yet answered Gardiner's long letter , but now , having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome , she was almost ashamed to find , that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as follows : I would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as I ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory , detail of particulars ;	6.118408010437707
Your's , c .	487.4441142809693
I see your design , Bingley , said his friend .	56.03104097923648
He will be forgot , and we shall all be as we were before .	41.57151172432754
E1 through 1 .	508.66837115231795
My dear , dear aunt , she rapturously cried , what delight !	43.25445389300335
And gravely glancing at Darcy , There is a fine old saying , which every body here is of course familiar with 'Keep your breath to cool your porridge , ' and I shall keep mine to swell my song .	6.776820289110607
The Lucases are very artful people indeed , sister .	53.137844889600466
Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement , but was too much oppressed to make any reply .	20.975956830587528
You need not .	664.8290386110627
You have a sweet room here , Bingley , and a charming prospect over that gravel walk .	20.93845280266047
My fingers , said Elizabeth , do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women's do .	15.39058530692714
But it was her business to be satisfied and certainly her temper to be happy ;	31.123846160742456
Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there ( an invitation moreover including the whole party ) so immediately after your arrival !	7.91108408382108
At last she recollected that she had been travelling , and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance .	16.558537166456418
Her aunt asked her , smilingly , how she liked it .	41.27381454994254
it was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small fortune , and however uncertain of giving happiness , must be their pleasantest preservative from want .	10.215768791882752
and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her , she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both , and could very sincerely wish him happy .	8.709220111782521
At present I have not room to do them justice .	51.0944859316601
She studied every sentence : and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different .	19.46583179490061
I will think no more about him .	106.9110524222766
II .	7079.122622599643
The evening passed quietly , unmarked by any thing extraordinary .	43.85406388944354
She found that she was to receive no other answer and , after a short pause , added , I think I have understood that Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again ?	11.79793719434927
She tried to recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence , that might rescue him from the attacks of Darcy ;	9.187128929927892
I comfort myself with thinking , replied Jane , that he certainly would not marry Lydia , if he had not a real regard for her .	18.98284901615227
When the gentlemen had joined them , and tea was over , the card tables were placed .	23.792052758420972
The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541 .	23.43904820742776
They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world .	39.41991204224557
They agreed that Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct ;	16.776863324790174
Is that his design in settling here ?	88.64054850967413
My dear Jane !	636.3775406794164
I assure you , I feel it exceedingly , said Lady Catherine ;	47.54256132362642
I am quite well .	305.6619918146604
VOL .	5682.7059499578245
I must think your language too strong in speaking of both , replied Jane , and I hope you will be convinced of it , by seeing them happy together .	12.081602939999112
and to see dear Wickham too !	198.00512919632862
It is well .	611.5607812616665
Miss Bingley made no answer ;	191.87085887444783
Lizzy is not a bit better than the others ;	81.6603731622155
will she be as tall as I am ?	96.52945480383853
His marriage was now fast approaching , and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable , and even repeatedly to say in an ill-natured tone that she wished they might be happy .	13.087886639812485
Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation .	33.93196077384515
Every time they met , it was more decided and remarkable .	38.965204426992024
and he scarcely opened his lips .	113.3447066534988
Her sister , however , assured her , of her being perfectly well ;	57.853249663422744
It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on such occasions it is the etiquette ;	16.099524170325413
My temper I dare not vouch for .	92.36097592151309
Anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn .	28.78175191125998
You have a very small park here , returned Lady Catherine after a short silence .	24.721335856175237
They lagged behind , while Elizabeth , Kitty , and Darcy , were to entertain each other .	37.79791011185688
it was really attentive ;	437.48561607669023
That you certainly shall .	297.32858017205643
and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance , were I distractedly in love with him , I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance .	13.741045328080357
her daughters , alarmed , anxious , uneasy .	72.72505459174565
but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer , larger picture of him than this .	19.762075258830915
While Mary is adjusting her ideas , he continued , let us return to Bingley .	24.40858762003909
If he did shrug his shoulders , it was not till Sir William was out of sight .	19.430260008464884
I do not get on at all .	75.8523911700544
What should not you mind ?	243.29630028852247
And since this sad affair has taken place , it is said , that he left Meryton greatly in debt ;	17.04896080407445
Let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many mortifications , for the sake of discovering them .	10.50045386449924
it is a handsome face .	261.6532502515676
Vain indeed must be all her attentions , vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself , if he were already self-destined to another .	11.73767115868472
I don't know .	612.0480493784802
One must speak a little , you know .	104.168359120864
Who that knows what his misfortunes have been , can help feeling an interest in him ?	21.852860896394592
and , while pretending to admire her work , said in a whisper , Go to your father , he wants you in the library .	19.742861324824364
Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character , and as she stood before the canvas , on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before ;	9.46239457801289
F1 .	6847.919774710029
I am perfectly satisfied .	308.2169912097527
Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure .	17.120491298135608
For we must attribute this happy conclusion , she added , in a great measure , to his kindness .	24.347759938713846
With astonishment did Elizabeth see , that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself .	20.487929553004573
Section 2 .	1571.4439182596846
Jane was beyond competition her favourite child .	89.09324709095364
When first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him ;	32.24036090306123
Mary wished to say something very sensible , but knew not how .	49.75248377460438
Perhaps , said Darcy , I should have judged better , had I sought an introduction , but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers .	14.226199474779001
If an individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are located in the United States , we do not claim a right to prevent you from copying , distributing , performing , displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg are removed .	5.681612417802204
F4 .	6847.919774710029
Elizabeth coloured , and said A little .	127.51840979174214
She then yawned again , threw aside her book , and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement ;	15.3249868679874
Two days after Bennet's return , as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them , and , concluding that she came to call them to their mother , went forward to meet her ;	9.144158737529136
Email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and official page at <URL> For additional contact information : Gregory B Newby Chief Executive and Director gbnewby<MENTION> .	4.583051246153162
Elizabeth said no more but her mind could not acquiesce .	59.79826163526244
Collins , seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her , but Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine's being rather displeased by her staying at home .	10.011898714900848
on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree , for in Darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against another .	9.514285908824244
It is Wickham's intention to go into the regulars ;	49.66089608233845
She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at , and it was rather too early to begin .	18.093456576938788
Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house ;	49.189601310834334
and whether she wished or feared it most , she could scarcely determine .	30.97191385972207
and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss De Bourgh , which I am certain he has very much at heart .	14.885724026898924
its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines , crowded with the young and the gay , and dazzling with scarlet ;	13.046710031795374
who attended to you ?	530.7399066747557
Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way .	32.393495295463445
His character was decided .	278.28036495802246
was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs .	45.05430441185357
Come , Darcy , said he , I must have you dance .	66.62757923420305
but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , Gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible .	10.262605321243322
No , Lizzy , that is what I do not choose .	68.01738191928881
He is as fine a fellow , said Bennet , as soon as they were out of the house , as ever I saw .	18.384946993691113
and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford between our pools at quadrille , while Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh's foot-stool , that she said , 'Collins , you must marry .	7.822946555600288
They could describe an entertainment with accuracy , relate an anecdote with humour , and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit .	10.36669212999748
It would vex me , indeed , to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard .	20.131090772970012
Your cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings .	63.55027368597814
However , I recollected afterwards , that if he had been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for Darcy might have done as well .	19.544736344179288
Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets ;	57.031870065131855
Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts , sarcastic humour , reserve , and caprice , that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character .	8.606781046970832
You are mistaken .	613.8518400609831
and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that Jane must soon cease to regard it , in the enjoyment of his .	20.84012624509475
Two inferences , however , were plainly deduced from the whole ;	54.99475808745172
Oh !	3082.833849588038
He is a gentleman ;	412.7485228057584
Believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention ;	20.658421823488926
and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh , I think it will be very tolerable .	15.511996111808067
Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin's praise ;	28.722666236437888
and returned no more , till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining-parlour .	28.460006927911216
and when she rose to take leave , Elizabeth , ashamed of her mother's ungracious and reluctant good wishes , and sincerely affected herself , accompanied her out of the room .	12.529648079443772
She saw him start at this , but he said nothing , and she continued , You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it .	11.58145676716819
very true , it will be wise in me to refrain from that .	38.63583874651562
No , replied Jane , I have not forgotten him ;	64.44342633440009
Every disposition of the ground was good ;	125.3115546035932
You never see a fault in any body .	73.37509253052995
Consider Collins's respectability , and Charlotte's prudent , steady character .	41.65834710359548
I now give it to you , if you are resolved on having him .	41.079580530136354
Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy .	106.7486772100742
and as she named their relationship to herself , she stole a sly look at him , to see how he bore it ;	16.16904928464008
Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane ;	29.066927209743636
You write uncommonly fast .	249.72286914226186
Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation , but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view .	16.202791709757815
In his present behaviour to herself , moreover , she had a fresh source of displeasure , for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance , could only serve , after what had since passed , to provoke her .	7.653213012482086
Well , that was very decided indeed that does seem as if but however , it may all come to nothing you know .	16.977654459020393
Mamma would like to go too of all things !	67.52827878183759
By tea-time however the dose had been enough , and Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again , and when tea was over , glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies .	12.590276261355783
Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family , she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort .	11.794457495814086
but she was proud of him .	134.3049028572635
What are men to rocks and mountains ?	55.45053876834117
Well , much good may it do them !	54.72361321064675
If he had not had a family of his own , I and my children must have had all his money you know , and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him , except a few presents .	14.51044218869998
They met several times , for there was much to be discussed .	49.013126184068156
The quiet , the retirement of such a life , would have answered all my ideas of happiness !	25.58402613175719
I only want to think you perfect , and you set yourself against it .	31.784033031131994
Of Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well ;	45.131259001793836
Chuse properly , chuse a gentlewoman for my sake ;	41.84141933630389
Among those who are at all his equals in consequence , he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous .	19.96074138375887
Those that best pleased her , as placing his conduct in the noblest light , seemed most improbable .	20.203007526588813
His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped , and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment , maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance , and except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth , requiring no partner in his pleasure .	9.10123823457068
Collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said , thanking her for every fish he won , and apologising if he thought he won too many .	10.908215508922028
I have been a disappointed man , and my spirits will not bear solitude .	33.37480371745925
They solaced their wretchedness , however , by duets after supper , while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister .	7.486705961258168
for his chief wish at present , was to have as little trouble in the business as possible .	29.348274577733047
Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions , but answered them very composedly .	35.591949014175974
and their mother's fortune , though ample for her situation in life , could but ill supply the deficiency of his .	19.320964649815945
You must write again very soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last .	19.502219738020646
They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas ;	59.03216476944329
So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper , or her affectionate heart .	16.32133427301759
and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament ;	21.10607841779043
Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation , that he never again distressed himself , or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth , by introducing the subject of it ;	15.95103376308794
At such an assembly as this , it would be insupportable .	51.3871530139508
From what can it proceed ?	181.70756934633133
Her father was walking about the room , looking grave and anxious .	35.96941153875323
The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion .	36.74319665955609
my dear father , she cried , come back , and write immediately .	49.34052911193372
As to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say she could not positively answer but she did not know of any prepossession ;	19.07370102962934
I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed !	37.17770206471581
He has more to give .	247.0777508932948
An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched ;	97.67899241538154
Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to , it was not on her side a scheme of infamy .	23.874208697001187
Their taking her home , and affording her their personal protection and countenance , is such a sacrifice to her advantage , as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge .	12.65995676657512
and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes , but his eagerness to grasp at any thing .	15.617685273627462
I believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as I wished it in reason .	25.050638812186815
My sisters may write to me .	119.08404770097313
No , no , nonsense , Lizzy .	100.550570507582
John told us Darcy was here when you sent for us ;	39.44414733247685
Not , however , from any fear of disadvantage from it , individually to herself ;	30.76683133468831
Many smiled ;	1601.7716826265457
It is impossible .	618.9719993488175
She was convinced that she could have been happy with him ;	63.42125705351265
All !	6918.586339496301
While I can have my mornings to myself , said she , it is enough .	33.13477729916243
One day's delay she observed , would be of small importance ;	45.02860043325755
I flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so .	52.32034130948464
He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday , to say that he had arrived in safety , and to give me his directions , which I particularly begged him to do .	13.43081230887969
There could not exist in the world two men , over whom Darcy could have such boundless influence .	18.45656187317653
I never was .	617.6883314690264
Her uncle and aunt were all amazement ;	105.34641655697128
The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story , gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach ;	8.27140199641759
In 2001 , the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations .	8.373649613123824
and , as far as their acquaintance reached , there was no fault to find .	27.59764322927278
and , in the imprudence of anger , took the first opportunity of saying , with sneering civility , Pray , Miss Eliza , are not the shire militia removed from Meryton ?	13.532224185688435
It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong ;	49.637236967968974
I knew it to be a most respectable , agreeable corps , and my friend Denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters , and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them .	9.101400563617531
They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother .	37.625324601474404
They were able to love each other , even as well as they intended .	34.12797490907555
Wickham will never marry a woman without some money .	57.36569692769342
That is the most unforgiving speech , said Elizabeth , that I ever heard you utter .	29.463147896260804
How despicably have I acted !	172.78112485589054
I am sure , said she , I cried for two days together when Colonel Millar's regiment went away .	12.602302570166547
Then addressing her daughter , Oh !	130.26012071707692
she added , by far too much .	142.201071138284
I know my own strength , and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming .	34.108579551190985
I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter , that I had known it , and purposely kept it from him .	14.78924716355265
He owns it himself without disguise .	88.7240007636543
and though , in looking forward , neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity , could be justly expected for her sister ;	13.419989493975311
Wickham's attention was caught ;	370.44852553790037
Excuse me for I must speak plainly .	134.85961353728524
cried Gardiner .	1578.5467626141083
Your mother insists upon your accepting it .	62.29757770775516
so easy , that every servant will cheat you ;	59.17166289475189
Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself ?	114.07111194616044
You used us abominably ill , answered Hurst , in running away without telling us that you were coming out .	13.439959628862844
and all three being actuated by one spirit , every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled .	13.861639797372218
and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane ;	16.186879207519095
Oh !	3082.833849588038
He had always intended to visit him , though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go ;	23.93142557142265
Perhaps I am not doing her justice .	106.43225601756428
Oh !	3082.833849588038
How long has she been such a favourite ?	89.7858825222583
You had much better dance .	194.9689023700662
for she was in no cheerful humour .	118.16413135473452
I certainly have had my share of beauty , but I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now .	21.676012980270983
Elizabeth asked questions in vain ;	149.72379580277817
I am sure I do not know .	87.03192735509494
How wonderfully these sort of things occur !	82.68526213008838
Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure .	32.24263604280628
I am very glad to hear such a good account of her , said Lady Catherine ;	49.959882810317886
but I will make her know it .	151.39491758377935
I am sorry , exceedingly sorry , replied Darcy , in a tone of surprise and emotion , that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness .	10.168291451488855
But when they had withdrawn , he said to her , Bennet , before you take any , or all of these houses , for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding .	13.338499892498723
LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a defect in this electronic work within <TIME_PERIOD > of receiving it , you can receive a refund of the money ( if any ) you paid for it by sending a written explanation to the person you received the work from .	5.671349515909784
If she is half as sharp as her mother , she is saving enough .	34.315673418569816
and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate , she began to regret that he came .	21.322175404966213
If he no longer cares for me , why silent ?	49.42496739606501
and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town , as Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them , on their first coming to London , before they procured lodgings .	12.710265552497637
But I suppose you had no opportunity .	129.2268902463622
But Bennet , who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday , which would exactly finish Jane's week , could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before .	10.36920369010422
and , for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings , care not how much I may be wounding your's .	17.747087156988876
and lastly , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked .	11.97744694414515
that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders , and that the business had been compromised accordingly .	21.852269098207284
Bingley had not been of age two years , when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House .	16.012265672966468
Their journey was performed without much conversation , or any alarm ;	44.25066086710497
Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do .	31.142445807949077
but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us , if I had not perceived , by Jane's letter last Wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it , and therefore what I now tell you , can give you no fresh pain .	8.405354281400264
In the former were many good paintings ;	80.36706886324022
and if you can compass it , do cure the younger girls of running after the officers .	23.704957603308504
Collins will be very glad of your company , I am sure .	55.59866908507701
When he was gone , they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on , and their uncle promised , at parting , to prevail on Bennet to return to Longbourn , as soon as he could , to the great consolation of his sister , who considered it as the only security for her husband's not being killed in a duel .	9.360293218285031
and thirdly which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness .	10.417740160453178
Elizabeth shook her head over this letter .	88.67893445039445
Do your sisters play and sing ?	103.3307237178681
When the ladies removed after dinner , Elizabeth ran up to her sister , and seeing her well guarded from cold , attended her into the drawing-room ;	12.194464007341194
He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man ;	67.99315669065635
I hardly know how Collins was first introduced to her notice , but he certainly has not known her long .	20.630578053264603
and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters , and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense .	12.799900041317136
To Jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merit she had undervalued ;	26.504177705580677
It settled the matter ;	342.9607237573271
Collins might never make the offer , and till he did , it was useless to quarrel about him .	20.06150369441437
no , my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both .	22.48405233894366
It was more than civil ;	238.24438905268917
If it were merely a fine house richly furnished , said she , I should not care about it myself ;	15.386396645764972
She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man ;	22.189753482237737
Bennet deigned not to make any reply ;	120.44019634867111
Had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place ?	34.277206953055334
Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed , and , while her courage was high , she immediately said , Darcy , I am a very selfish creature ;	16.345286765168858
When Bennet wrote again to his brother , therefore , he sent his permission for them to come ;	23.251773791775562
but how could that be ?	157.72436069584444
And a special licence .	249.77183395391214
and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them , he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing , and called out to her , My dear Miss Eliza , why are not you dancing ?	12.249910152160215
Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all , but she could see it and write of it without material pain .	21.016392279225688
She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way .	13.390521137957057
Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from Charlotte , as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling .	20.18879048363127

My father bears it better .	148.17265253159445
Mary was obliged to mix more with the world , but she could still moralize over every morning visit ;	18.650295276559834
I am going to-morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality , who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him .	11.217652721094785
and the good-natured wishes for her well-doing , which had proceeded before , from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton , lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances , because with such an husband , her misery was considered certain .	8.812365770758648
Two offences of a very different nature , and by no means of equal magnitude , you last night laid to my charge .	17.75825683070071
She supposed , if he meant any thing , he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter .	19.29263306151481
Redistribution is subject to the trademark license , especially commercial redistribution .	36.72517725692121
but the emotion was short , and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued .	19.01719198328423
Very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia , whose own misery was extreme , and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family .	9.790082673709566
Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable ;	57.56525899059429
Do you prefer reading to cards ?	93.88148654042243
where is your sash my dear ?	176.02091395603622
but I thought I might as well buy it as not .	44.795134363499535
But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together ;	19.40253121963187
CHAPTER III .	1575.3856872474946
Soon after their return , a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet ;	50.24197850083446
and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there , recurring to her mind , the few minutes in which they continued together , were some of the most uncomfortable of her life .	15.55787151637947
Jane listened with astonishment and concern ;	119.91421471417001
We must have Long and the Gouldings soon .	90.96042374374414
Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer ;	24.704609027621014
and while Sir William accompanied him , Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house , extremely well pleased , probably , to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's help .	10.991927254954593
He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance , but that is all .	27.007130234064316
It is the greatest of favours when Miss De Bourgh comes in .	29.454760618702412
They had long wished to see him .	107.45132961109054
At length the chaise arrived , the trunks were fastened on , the parcels placed within , and it was pronounced to be ready .	16.17047637932246
I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way .	32.5999466711036
for thither Collins had followed him after breakfast , and there he would continue , nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection , but really talking to Bennet , with little cessation , of his house and garden at Hunsford .	8.786355480064625
He , who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open pleasantry .	11.774990556385863
Compared with some families , I believe we were ;	78.71803889932087
In this room they were received by Miss Darcy , who was sitting there with Hurst and Miss Bingley , and the lady with whom she lived in London .	13.022357776699916
She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it ;	46.10907296035126
Do not give way to useless alarm , added he , though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain .	14.870615713478358
but Collins , after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will , and should never resent her behaviour as any affront , seated himself at another table with Bennet , and prepared for backgammon .	8.729600550875299
A younger son , you know , must be inured to self-denial and dependence .	25.136214637764155
We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word .	45.23652547717702
Yes , or I will never see her again .	91.53331823263312
You have shewn him off now much more than he did himself .	28.88369204197247
From what we have seen of him , continued Gardiner , I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body , as he has done by poor Wickham .	13.249456914954424
She had known , it seems , of their being in love with each other , many weeks .	26.911912076887372
I have , Very well .	175.24287164492443
Through letters , whatever of good or bad was to be told , would be communicated , and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance .	11.749321387297254
It is fortunate , then , that they fall to my lot instead of to yours .	22.260750854412496
Tell him what a dreadful state I am in , that I am frightened out of my wits ;	26.352209974299416
The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings dreadful .	96.61711448649325
Because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement .	38.29086780532907
She could not bear such suspense ;	119.39278045989624
And quite alone ?	606.8117151508061
Nor did that day wear out her resentment .	50.92210497958003
In ran Bennet to her daughter's room , in her dressing gown , and with her hair half finished , crying out , My dear Jane , make haste and hurry down .	11.301892579153238
what does he say ?	293.3230740717768
sir , I do indeed .	364.23989078607127
Is it true ?	585.8950419922394
They could not be untouched by his politeness , and had they drawn his character from their own feelings , and his servant's report , without any reference to any other account , the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known , would not have recognised it for Darcy .	10.121230505541273
but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right .	56.98211949508424
What made you so shy of me , when you first called , and afterwards dined here ?	24.85782521528489
If it was not allowable for him to gain my affections , because I had no money , what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about , and who was equally poor ?	10.28252563774226
and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me .	49.71834816411789
Till this moment , I never knew myself .	100.47526389521667
She looked forward to their entrance , as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend .	20.4784574360163
He was not seated by her ;	191.7087527256157
a respectable-looking , elderly woman , much less fine , and more civil , than she had any notion of finding her .	17.437225566091076
but Elizabeth , less clear-sighted perhaps in his case than in Charlotte's , did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence .	14.851842210953142
who should do it but her own uncle ?	92.26954633571334
She respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his welfare ;	24.685251303402012
He is a sweet tempered , amiable , charming man .	40.89730056401481
I want to know , said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister's , what you have learnt about Wickham .	17.13574077782295
Such a disappointment !	564.3153036078982
It is often only carelessness of opinion , and sometimes an indirect boast .	24.604264258968993
I have just had a letter from Jane , with such dreadful news .	38.09427565190435
Her heart did whisper , that he had done it for her .	41.228733585078245
Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet's general habits , she was absolutely incredulous here .	21.520332241479103
we will ask you no questions .	110.68343893658397
It was dated from Rosings , at eight o'clock in the morning , and was as follows : Be not alarmed , Madam , on receiving this letter , by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments , or renewal of those offers , which were last night so disgusting to you .	7.441506518904142
Her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating .	41.16217959338798
When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen , they returned down stairs , and taking leave of the housekeeper , were consigned over to the gardener , who met them at the hall door .	11.789420538458955
cried Gardiner , whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive .	32.095249665062326
made no mention of the business that had taken him away , and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it .	18.01977939430927
for he was discovered to be proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased ;	28.543823088811763
Every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world ;	41.05632200402413
A few days after this visit , Bingley called again , and alone .	37.98027368677525
Elizabeth was determined ;	697.2697887698519
and then was enraged against herself for being so silly !	40.915733702022386
I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly .	43.723160562963145
Wickham , Lydia , were all forgotten .	187.24608265328118
Oh !	3082.833849588038
But it is fortunate , thought she , that I have something to wish for .	33.98341876188607
He has been here this half hour , and master has had a letter .	34.94231836710581
our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered ;	82.01548758497809
But I cannot I have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly .	20.270240602500408
Charlotte had hardly time to answer , before they were joined by Kitty , who came to tell the same news , and no sooner had they entered the breakfast-room , where Bennet was alone , than she likewise began on the subject , calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion , and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family .	8.457514598196402
I have not forgot , you see ;	112.46809426456149
and during part of that time , Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Bingley , who came from the dance for a few minutes , to press his friend to join it .	13.238371730107966
cried Elizabeth , when she had finished .	146.26894919336516
But every line proved more clearly that the affair , which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent , as to render Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous , was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole .	7.582673774349784
and had any thing of the kind been perceptible , you must be aware that ours is not a family , on which it could be thrown away .	17.033968000010674
Bennet , to whose apartment they all repaired , after a few minutes conversation together , received them exactly as might be expected ;	14.518841092861111
and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air , with such a companion .	19.128759702984972
Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening .	12.039241417198046
for , if I recollect right , he went but the day before .	44.451063132720215
The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire , you must know , was at a ball and at this ball , what do you think he did ?	17.126923473603153
the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me .	27.406215772505757
I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not .	27.767056666084866
Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now .	44.70504894719226
It has often led him to be liberal and generous , to give his money freely , to display hospitality , to assist his tenants , and relieve the poor .	12.197347659150022
The discussion of Collins's offer was now nearly at an end , and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother .	10.440408358925454
and her invitation was accepted with alacrity .	86.42721884574824
On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn ;	44.850314913493605
Sir William Lucas , and his daughter Maria , a good humoured girl , but as empty-headed as himself , had nothing to say that could be worth hearing , and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise .	10.78631629809652
CHAPTER I Miss Bingley's letter arrived , and put an end to doubt .	34.54878762527093
Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph 1 .	17.202951854657005
and by a manoeuvre of Bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone , which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family .	9.430620970103504
I know your disposition , Lizzy .	137.98119087060323
When the clock struck three , Elizabeth felt that she must go ;	35.80377893259145
And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth !	25.243090424695506
And I certainly never shall give it .	80.6966154525239
but we will hope at some future period , to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known , and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence .	8.358339843493544
But I have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected .	39.25573827249072
Young ladies of her age , are sometimes a little difficult to manage , and if she has the true Darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way .	14.250850898016974
to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before Collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery .	10.370674722071268
How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Darcy , for now they do appear wholly undeserved .	11.223731508940624
I understand that Collins has made you an offer of marriage .	37.83045050627114
Such was Miss Lucas's scheme ;	158.64346357161517
and she coloured at the idea ;	155.5145785051906
This room was my late master's favourite room , and these miniatures are just as they used to be then .	18.195568203668746
You promised me to insist upon her marrying him .	45.3955436779678
and I am sure if I had been you , I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it .	18.382146773810383
At length , however , the question was asked by her uncle ;	45.800830381203404
Darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours .	49.03418029572577
She wished to discredit it entirely , repeatedly exclaiming , This must be false !	23.0874816337243
for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though George Wickham has treated Darcy in a most infamous manner .	17.20664090849411
This letter gave Elizabeth some pain ;	82.86732626575612
In marrying your nephew , I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere .	23.662725477253815
I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading !	39.35715383904433
I hope your plans in favour of the shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood .	26.534209075762746
I cannot misunderstand you , but I intreat you , dear Lizzy , not to pain me by thinking that person to blame , and saying your opinion of him is sunk .	13.175845160470276
Miss Bennet , I insist on being satisfied .	96.58962195064652
Oh !	3082.833849588038
Yes , she did .	576.1740830631906
How odious I should think them !	134.475881545467
and if he had the fortune he ought to have , I should think you could not do better .	27.045603763736953
Unless where they like women of fortune , which I think they very often do .	24.896379967227997
CHAPTER IV .	1311.7971600904
She soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt , who did call on him in her return through London , and there relate her journey to Longbourn , its motive , and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth ;	10.126700346182533
but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her .	47.77241936350329
My sole dependence was on you ;	112.72852427080228
My fingers wait your orders .	135.2850847689995
As for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin Elizabeth .	8.750874807765022
Certainly .	7006.816337342497
who can it be ?	381.5382614521148
and much as she had always been disposed to like him , she could not think without anger , hardly without contempt , on that easiness of temper , that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends , and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations .	8.801026757287138
Since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and expedite a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with Wickham , he easily learnt , had never been his design .	13.539137722796559
and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of or I may say , three very silly sisters .	13.280484230559964
you are a great deal too apt you know , to like people in general .	36.256559116186196
Before any answer could arrive from Collins , or any congratulations to Elizabeth , from his wife , the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas lodge .	11.758218009720483
His words seemed to imply it .	110.682684162856
Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment , after such an affront to Colonel Forster ?	25.089341072830134
and Collins was to attend them , at the request of Bennet , who was most anxious to get rid of him , and have his library to himself ;	18.189571119633086
While thus engaged , Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ;	12.347470524372977
Perhaps there was some truth in this ;	133.28721846843328
was it so ?	918.0831389994586
I am glad of one thing , that he comes alone ;	50.42561990440526
He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before ;	30.491865957632907
She got up , and ran out of the room ;	78.13368146142491
There are a lot of things you can do with Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works .	7.0500501285601995
Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution ;	62.14820753669534
when he spoke , his accent had none of its usual sedateness ;	39.9121782919557
The darling wish of his sisters was then gratified ;	80.84770637726113
You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper .	29.262274136503912
She had been watching him the last hour , she said , as he walked up and down the street , and had Wickham appeared Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation , but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers , who in comparison with the stranger , were become stupid , disagreeable fellows .	7.210360985804406
Money !	6847.919774710029
This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening , in summer ;	39.54076408716098
At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal , if he had not been well assured of his cousin's corroboration .	9.23901309785963
Ah !	5682.7059499578245
The paling of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side .	26.849368522828318
But I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed .	22.808849878615746
1 .	4079.0161042043856
she was aware that no one liked him but Jane ;	65.36424957808818
Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight ;	54.212064422585875
and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last .	16.134649589259503
I defy even Sir William Lucas himself , to produce a more valuable son-in-law .	28.82182287627004
and not a day went by without a solitary walk , in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections .	15.329878667094949
and Elizabeth began to like them herself , when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for Jane .	17.211934148832338
The gentlemen came ;	642.7470969100486
I have seen them both .	203.7371753236797
I beg your pardon .	276.0261431083962
But there were other causes of repugnance ;	78.9717295155755
This , madam , is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together ;	23.001870753651097
and yet how many things have happened !	80.73338725296506
I only fear that the sort of cautiousness , to which you , I imagine , have been alluding , is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe .	9.60391273203443
The one missent must be first attended to ;	64.68183473112758
and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia's connections , which is not likely , can I suppose her so lost to every thing ?	13.745363513212524
and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind .	14.455204271800778
and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal .	18.844003559136766
To the little town of Lambton , the scene of Gardiner's former residence , and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained , they bent their steps , after having seen all the principal wonders of the country ;	8.285257466656137
yet she received them with tolerable ease , and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment , or any unnecessary complaisance .	11.535657322078372
Come here , child , cried her father as she appeared .	58.44130541180103
Bingley , she had likewise seen for an instant , and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed .	16.70815148244868
They were , therefore , to go .	166.06577202491792
That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask .	44.66864634814889
I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere .	38.39504155596415
What are you telling Miss Bennet ?	140.1064839419487
It seems an hopeless business .	136.95156883192948
I hate such false friends .	147.62844968817225
He is come Bingley is come .	124.26671621121152
and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual , and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation .	12.159290244569254
I am not qualified to form one .	74.65066893159553
Yes , Ma'am , all .	215.30036093745142
She liked him too little to care for his approbation .	52.51503703584893
Oh !	3082.833849588038
CHAPTER VI .	1311.7971600904
I think not .	664.1058247811654
and then added , May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left and Collins well .	14.218918937232448
My dear Jane , I am in such a flutter , that I am sure I can't write ;	23.459675134777633
Where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant , distance becomes no evil .	16.75957079291647
She asked her at different times , how many sisters she had , whether they were older or younger than herself , whether any of them were likely to be married , whether they were handsome , where they had been educated , what carriage her father kept , and what had been her mother's maiden name ?	9.208219484838093
We can all plague and punish one another .	40.24120848401706
At length Darcy spoke , and in a constrained manner said , Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them , is less certain .	9.144049592725082
E1 .	6125.411827414266
Towards him I have been kinder than towards myself .	59.319267678105675
Indeed , Darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire and , give me leave to say , very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate , and such things may come out , as will shock your relations to hear .	8.567962936973617
Could she exert herself it would be better , but this is not to be expected ;	31.735708410387023
A glass of wine ;	250.057665072697
She performed her part indeed without much graciousness , but Bennet was satisfied , and soon afterwards ordered her carriage .	17.37610571032073
That is as it happens .	238.80048507762172
Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself , that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking , which ceased when he saw her no more ;	11.97161443940205
Maria would tell her nothing more , and down they ran into the dining-room , which fronted the lane , in quest of this wonder ;	16.44673018354632
Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly .	58.99322241918382
But , my dear sister , can I be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere ?	10.387981194271969
All young ladies accomplished !	367.5261667575424
Yes , vanity is a weakness indeed .	94.70910332838993
Elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again , she wanted Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her .	13.340141548564501
but whether always charming , it is not for me to determine .	39.662518997651794
In short , I will do my best .	101.6679336088051
Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday ;	192.9871707268658
Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them ;	69.14982095241562
But this idea was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw Darcy walk into the room .	13.856550235074101
And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley .	33.58767770212292
till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of Bingley , and her being the sister of Jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding , made every body eager for another , to supply the idea .	12.088969241654329
Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service .	4.541400354077013
Are they indeed ?	553.8340067943288
And then , with a slight bow , turned again into the plantation , and was soon out of sight .	22.396727103847027
CHAPTER VIII .	1403.50908934543
She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do ;	14.08229467594295
I will take care of myself , and of Wickham too .	58.057534758836866
He addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet , with a polite congratulation ;	38.61391790389065
Between the two eldest and herself especially , there subsisted a very particular regard .	28.441902362626415
She was afraid of talking longer of his friend ;	75.1924678603866
I did not think you would ;	206.44650156637033
and as a punishment for him , as well as a possible advantage to Jane , she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Darcy's sister , as , by Wickham's account , she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away .	9.783928493052983
Take whatever you like , and get away .	88.4996402692481
Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year , which , unfortunately for his daughters , was entailed in default of heirs male , on a distant relation ;	8.06205231373656
That he is as false and deceitful , as he is insinuating .	45.93975899751469
The whist party soon afterwards breaking up , the players gathered round the other table , and Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Philips .	12.12291107875162
Oxford , Blenheim , Warwick , Kenelworth , Birmingham , c .	19.16227627145141
The envelope itself was likewise full .	82.77819669362682
Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it ;	36.34785174438209
CHAPTER XV .	1311.7971600904
and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well .	28.604111662056226
cried Lydia .	1520.9687570215838
The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit , and the result of it was , that the youngest should tax Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield .	10.527598916408355
You make me laugh , Charlotte ;	124.6756892603904
Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk ;	97.95560648624455
Did Charlotte dine with you ?	223.62881609128618
for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort springs from a breach of promise , for I ought not to have mentioned the subject ?	14.103427420156715
And till Colonel Forster came himself , not one of you entertained a doubt , I suppose , of their being really married ?	17.34999145668233
They had several children .	252.0390858362136
But of every other neglect I can believe him capable .	53.03852519639398
and to complete the view , she saw herself seated beneath a tent , tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once .	9.717456941160203
I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance .	21.458361617898184
and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my cards .	14.2537854876109
While in their cradles , we planned the union : and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished , in their marriage , to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly unallied to the family !	9.576958599918653
It is not quite a week since they left Brighton .	52.71455848621299
I should not mind any thing at all .	79.72804970121997
You were Bingley's first choice .	137.74809400315877
I cannot see why Forster should not ask me as well as Lydia , said she , though I am not her particular friend .	14.808380363620733
Bingley was punctual to his appointment ;	140.74022604085957
my dear , dear Jane , I am so happy !	66.94650126842136
and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once .	21.907321471248178
So , do not put yourself to inconvenience .	83.24409734276102
And so , I suppose , they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead .	20.887156063225465
How I long to see her again !	93.42512334220781
To Pemberley , therefore , they were to go .	90.27812101633502
You have widely mistaken my character , if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these .	18.892264655415925
Here are officers enough at Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country .	23.68209236652115
But on the following morning , every hope of this kind was done away .	38.83166068252154
He was silent .	584.4467443811347
cried Wickham with a look which did not escape her .	49.31483926301422
I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's connections .	69.87362793661318
Well , if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own , so much the better .	22.41707344198399
Lady Catherine seemed resigned .	296.3491573460958
Your great men often are ;	135.48982007456985
He declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister's attachment ;	40.36594280845467
My dearest Lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Darcy , to be treating his father's favourite in such a manner , one , whom his father had promised to provide for .	9.823605842819324
Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks , online payments and credit card donations .	11.104836310967604
a report which highly incensed Bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood .	20.24961285908766
Do let me ask my partner to introduce you .	48.077524782151436
and while she steadily repressed it , could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing , that however long , and for whatever cause , his attentions had been withdrawn , her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal .	8.296719950160304
my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken .	81.37227438760956
The next was in these words .	161.5767918306738
Her ladyship was highly incensed .	178.3407119508123
To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate !	33.50820243387335
In this perturbed state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on ;	22.874424402450067
but , though she always kept a very good table , she did not think any thing less than two courses , could be good enough for a man , on whom she had such anxious designs , or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a-year .	8.960113271357367
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him ;	30.10539104889193
he has some friends , though perhaps not so many as he deserves .	49.3586504869365
They will ruin your happiness .	138.53033102431368
and at the age of twenty-seven , without having ever been handsome , she felt all the good luck of it .	18.723348074138165
From what I can collect , he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them .	17.61040510831953
Could she have seen half as much love in Darcy for herself , she would have ordered her wedding clothes .	18.61320368280972
The horses were post ;	272.284989900432
Well , and what news does it bring ?	89.20867092677318
Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning , and writing to Jane , while Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village , when she was startled by a ring at the door , the certain signal of a visitor .	10.287572239601795
Thoughtlessness , want of attention to other people's feelings , and want of resolution , will do the business .	22.38365805985077
There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended ;	22.880336659399635
You doubt me , cried Jane , slightly colouring ;	73.57440609381621
The possibility of meeting Darcy , while viewing the place , instantly occurred .	33.40263150000294
No , that I am sure I shall not ;	86.69776170958639
and she made the most of the time , by visiting about with her daughter , and having very frequent parties at home .	22.534663774267965
But she had chosen it with her eyes open ;	83.22804749993247
He is nothing to us , you know , and I am sure I never want to see him again .	26.909016344960577
Lydia does not leave me because she is married ;	69.76304624954474
My love , should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much ?	34.96156219927257
Another intreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the desired effect ;	30.163368754546077
We have tried two or three subjects already without success , and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine .	15.476997567630196
Of course , we hope that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work .	7.336059591603697
and the girls smiled on each other .	96.16854991073261
and if she were married to him to-morrow , I should think she had as good a chance of happiness , as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth .	15.030020307706996
Your humility , Bingley , said Elizabeth , must disarm reproof .	45.0421098001289
How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own daughters I cannot understand ;	14.425606784332611
and her features are not at all handsome .	105.64526151953518
You observed it , Darcy , I am sure , said Miss Bingley ;	46.97074766492612
I know you will do him such ample justice , that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent .	14.64242124743204
It cannot last long .	257.2019434877637
no , no , this is not likely .	111.76055543059317
If he had another motive , I am sure it would never disgrace him .	33.75770409720883
Well , well , I only hope it will last .	61.22632901893684
In a fortnight they were to go , and once gone , she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account .	20.071072631354056
I appeal to Darcy : but let me not interrupt you , You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady , whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me .	7.654508087107624
And for this we are to be thankful .	96.80330485303091
Miss Bennet still looked all amazement .	118.19755517643536
She became jealous of his esteem , when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it .	26.481321760743494
but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming , she had no wish of her recovering immediately , as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield .	11.56444451819164
I was given good principles , but left to follow them in pride and conceit .	23.682224672651692
for though I am the youngest , I'm the tallest .	44.29859291097736
You are over scrupulous surely .	138.33008585852915
and she turned away with alarm , while Reynolds replied , that he was , adding , but we expect him to-morrow , with a large party of friends .	14.1765408430054
yes .	6271.69929924415
I thank you , again and again , for not going to the Lakes .	44.27593288139221
I know them a little .	304.1655862374802
and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send .	70.66403774769375
How could you begin ?	276.01026305543604
But I am at his disposal .	157.1847988169258
There was no help for it however .	105.86316891571317
Thank God !	1601.7716826265457
It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth ;	37.53416075633965
oh !	6847.919774710029
what's his name .	685.4785683085885
and the pleasure of being with Charlotte , and the kind attentions she had received , must make her feel the obliged .	20.573268432169023
Well girls , said she , as soon as they were left to themselves , What say you to the day ?	22.525528482544114
Why should they not go on to Scotland , if that had been the case ?	36.6258843917397
All that I can promise you , therefore , is not to be in a hurry .	45.4605596528151
My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly , to try to discover her .	24.9708084378068
I wish I could say any thing to comfort you , replied Elizabeth ;	35.12566975850743
But you know married women have never much time for writing .	31.180834789887367
it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited ;	31.790768343310955
And you saw the old housekeeper , I suppose ?	72.76060576681886
but Wickham was as far beyond them all in person , countenance , air , and walk , as they were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips , breathing port wine , who followed them into the room .	10.244417473380004
It was consoling , that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush .	14.540824541057523
Of his former way of life , nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself .	23.508479157603993
there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her , and though by no means so clever as herself , she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her's , he might become a very agreeable companion .	7.823511560977283
he replied , and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled .	37.894341382457455
but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless .	40.124156464148804
But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment .	24.267408324618007
But I will not torment you with vain wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks .	15.493434491340471
but such of us as wished to learn , never wanted the means .	26.01058058472243
Yes , Sir ;	617.8136224349927
In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else , and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room .	17.669428164170185
Bingley urged Jones's being sent for immediately ;	65.21701337827659
though it was some time , I confess , before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice .	31.176457846821325
and from such as had been already visible below , she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcy's , in crayons , whose subjects were usually more interesting , and also more intelligible .	8.925788695431152
I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies .	43.178434270638746
The whole party before them , indeed , excited a lively attention .	35.279886345773406
I shall be back by dinner .	114.96309884755085
and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do .	15.392272355684739
You cannot have been always at Longbourn .	127.62367077429406
Well , my dear , said he , when she ceased speaking , I have no more to say .	25.89712453875731
and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view , as he meant to chuse one of the daughters , if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report .	9.39245057760362
you mean Jane , I suppose because he danced with her twice .	48.42963752978443
Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor .	58.59995554355686
Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here ;	56.89504888719219
Ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either , detection could not be in your power , and suspicion certainly not in your inclination .	16.630229511138104
Not handsome enough to dance with !	149.93955786752232
Elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak ;	21.10306206832546
How Darcy looked , therefore , she could not tell .	63.75039328684666
Elizabeth was pleased , though , when she asked herself the reason , she had very little to say in reply .	26.011984618592848
Impossible , Bennet , impossible , when I am not acquainted with him myself ;	42.00838570381844
I told him , moreover , that I believed myself mistaken in supposing , as I had done , that your sister was indifferent to him ;	19.85004572119211
and still thought there might have been time enough .	61.01163502988318
I shall not be able to keep you and so I warn you .	30.934855881061594
My dear , dear Lydia !	191.41015650860274
It was owing to him , to his reserve , and want of proper consideration , that Wickham's character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was .	14.571176772933484
It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened .	23.233063615282433
Such a countenance , such manners !	157.88056498137806
Lydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself .	17.541559365309144
I know very well , madam , said he , that when persons sit down to a card table , they must take their chance of these things , and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object .	9.700389850438771
While there was an officer in Meryton , they would flirt with him ;	38.855493543281376
they were dances of mortification .	208.61733406750298
CHAPTER XIII .	1311.7971600904
and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time .	32.916175249773474
That is very true , said Elizabeth ;	106.17320440409449
But it was not to be .	207.87805551527336
Elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced ;	89.16590556075435
She was going to the butcher's , she told me , on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday , and she has got three couple of ducks , just fit to be killed .	11.223323604354007
she replied , endeavouring to recover herself .	97.39396807375284
The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time , and the plan became perfect as plan could be .	14.519013368445794
It is enough to know they are discovered , I have seen them both Then it is , as I always hoped , cried Jane ;	18.74860476157855
Only this ;	1652.475589117241
You judge very properly , said Bennet , and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy .	14.067254092234677
But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule .	12.549773796425121
I was only confused for the moment , because I felt that I should be looked at .	35.34310273331562
She began at length to recover , to fidget about in her chair , get up , sit down again , wonder , and bless herself .	12.953516662187633
her eldest daughter , she must just mention she felt it incumbent on her to hint , was likely to be very soon engaged .	19.633525566054274
No , I believe not .	273.3475882395817
VOL .	5682.7059499578245
for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone .	33.84320412419536
The far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances .	27.766388065480726
but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts , fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one , with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance .	8.358541951005385
Pray write instantly , and let me understand it unless it is , for very cogent reasons , to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary ;	14.086822401553228
The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard , his claims on Darcy , and all that he had suffered from him , was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed ;	15.691805078421568
But when Elizabeth told of his silence , it did not seem very likely , even to Charlotte's wishes , to be the case ;	20.074863201866854
Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well-bred man , and talked very pleasantly ;	14.969195320104223
Into one house in this neighbourhood , they shall never have admittance .	38.08853556901967
But with me , it is not so .	115.88270321404347
Nor was it under many , many minutes , that she could comprehend what she heard ;	25.129129329558005
It drew from her , however , the exertion of speaking , which nothing else had so effectually done before ;	20.09866025115078
Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied , Yes , you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that .	19.58187943822034
Her air was not conciliating , nor was her manner of receiving them , such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank .	15.451942475143245
When those dances were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by Darcy , who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him .	10.486075310218373
She was very equal therefore to address Bingley on the subject of the ball , and abruptly reminded him of his promise ;	17.54347916779274
Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning ;	35.02523481067195
When dinner was over , she returned directly to Jane , and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room .	18.433752212011452
This young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way , with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire , splendid property , noble kindred , and extensive patronage .	8.99293234129428
Kitty is slight and delicate , and Mary studies so much , that her hours of repose should not be broken in on .	15.672510086309627
But I have always observed , that they who are good-natured when children , are good-natured when they grow up ;	17.252289149423202
but she still thought him partial to Jane , and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend's permission , or being bold enough to come without it .	12.24252354794219
You must send John with the young ladies , Collins .	54.20088104715531
Pray read on .	581.7431419594379
CHAPTER XI .	1403.50908934543
but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it , and making her sister the excuse , said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book .	12.245431588604731
but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal ;	40.380931458827256
But we must stem the tide of malice , and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other , the balm of sisterly consolation .	11.120394770103841
the happiest , wisest , most reasonable end !	54.27716851498867
At that instant she felt , that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends , for moments of such painful confusion .	14.466289532241625
Not like the wild young men now-a-days , who think of nothing but themselves .	25.499772728415987
I believe she did and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object .	18.069466705155143
and Wickham , who happened to sit near Elizabeth , began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood , with a good humoured ease , which she felt very unable to equal in her replies .	11.724388692312614
and by her connivance and aid , he so far recommended himself to Georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement .	9.932329552759798
How much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book !	36.261943127673476
Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Darcy .	76.10819295813926
it cannot be .	890.4984572961436
His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own ;	36.86253116719919
he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield , and she blushed as she answered , I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family .	13.756126066876309
The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter , and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country .	8.839618262460768
What he means to do , I am sure I know not ;	42.66570817798986
Generous , good man , I am afraid he has distressed himself .	42.671825584632685
His doing so drew her notice .	94.0145728747699
The consequence of it is , that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have , and that Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever .	17.4303737278493
Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word .	72.0442636617724
Gardiner left them soon after breakfast .	147.67304606437983
To Darcy it was welcome intelligence Elizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough .	40.070570188111226
I knew how it would be I knew he would manage every thing .	34.24667561044502
a father absent , a mother incapable of exertion , and requiring constant attendance ;	28.55897581895489
It was then disclosed in the following manner .	94.51995809065093
Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay , as they had been at first .	20.789163324220215
I need not explain myself farther ;	105.19002377826999
his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do .	22.51843967472012
Indeed you must go , for it will be impossible for us to visit him , if you do not .	27.25153939054304
Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends , that could materially lessen its weight .	22.46389808949932
and her uncle and aunt , leaving her to enjoy them in quiet , set off by themselves .	18.94449993105409
Well , he is a very undeserving young man and I do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now .	17.25719366869405
and now , I hope you are satisfied .	114.95843745394507
III .	6847.919774710029
In a doleful voice Bennet thus began the projected conversation .	28.863697791485027
But these , I suppose , are precisely what you are without .	41.57514001841649
She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love , rather than by his ;	12.950744066214044
for a few minutes he was silent ;	167.65076439486708
It is a long time , Bingley , since you went away , said Bennet .	34.44708963027292
no one was to be put in competition with him .	64.76294882606275
One has got all the goodness , and the other all the appearance of it .	36.74359619624357
the eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt , there cannot be two opinions on that point .	22.663227610222073
She answered him in the usual way , and after a moment's pause , added , My eldest sister has been in town these three months .	17.969441844496554
and Lady Lucas , who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken .	10.411250850859902
It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man .	12.605368262749534
Elizabeth , as she affectionately embraced her , whilst tears filled the eyes of both , lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives .	12.278330547365195
Long before it had taken place , my opinion of you was decided .	45.2374548463526
Dear , dear Lizzy .	392.7193859253686
But I can assure you , she added , that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy ;	17.400042547103613
When , after examining the mother , in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Darcy , she turned her eyes on the daughter , she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment , at her being so thin , and so small .	9.93826810148293
The conduct of neither , if strictly examined , will be irreproachable ;	31.669496264146183
My mind was more agreeably engaged .	130.27609800873105
She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances , and she was in no humour to indulge him .	17.827382292624282
He had certainly formed such a plan , and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend .	10.352410802669187
True ;	7079.122622599643
whenever she was alone , she gave way to it as the greatest relief ;	62.70387810747962
The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner , and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank such affability and condescension , as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine .	8.435799216551604
And pray , Lizzy , what said Lady Catherine about this report ?	36.653549540824734
By the Author of Sense and Sensibility .	51.67910674995184
But of all the views which his garden , or which the country , or the kingdom could boast , none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings , afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house .	7.998289849927974
No thanks to his gallantry for that .	111.55261489307271
and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see Darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea .	11.875636579994962
Bennet , with great civility , begged her ladyship to take some refreshment ;	31.981481880831726
An unhappy alternative is before you , Elizabeth .	89.94302574737755
and while Darcy was attending them to their carriage , Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth's person , behaviour , and dress .	13.618637533413722
Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted ?	54.44321874796054
I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband ;	19.13020265772468
Believe her to be deceived by all means .	98.59140004726164
and though more astonished than gratified herself , by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her .	13.321657066960688
for she received an invitation from Forster , the wife of the Colonel of the regiment , to accompany her to Brighton .	23.351592229737907
It is almost past belief .	146.4755662917454
LIMITED WARRANTY , DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the Right of Replacement or Refund described in paragraph 1 .	8.797782942363893
The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements , with such news as the country afforded ;	16.063450669540874
Imagine our surprise .	562.3223053690325
but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded .	48.726060041048946
Good gracious !	1373.0350778783054
and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world .	20.36917300299795
A low phaeton , with a nice little pair of ponies , would be the very thing .	22.036206592098324
Your coming to Longbourn , to see me and my family , said Elizabeth , coolly , will be rather a confirmation of it ;	20.13187274414507
I am ashamed of you !	269.0321868294772
He is rich , to be sure , and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane .	17.616042190139062
Miss Darcy , though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations , readily obeyed .	17.105349857132598
he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire , and Jane and Elizabeth , in addition to every other source of happiness , were within thirty miles of each other .	12.694806847086452
That he was surprised by the connexion was evident ;	81.61831582120638
A clear ten thousand per annum .	102.03311275064269
My dear Bennet , you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother .	24.027225027012474
This is the only point , I flatter myself , on which we do not agree .	40.54854233528603
Four nieces of Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means ;	20.109216264256013
Till I can forget his father , I can never defy or expose him .	28.665533058881557
But now several minutes elapsed , without bringing the sound of his voice ;	29.51792381225015
had I known what I ought , what I dared , to do !	50.46533915047916
that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance !	64.2479510992526
Her power was sinking ;	249.89591237722286
1 .	4079.0161042043856
and perhaps he might be doing the same .	111.97632453185014
Yes , he had no engagement at all for to-morrow ;	69.61934258614302
When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night , she followed her , and made the important communication .	22.023417134589305
Yes , very indifferent indeed , said Elizabeth , laughingly .	53.558138440944
Miss Elizabeth Bennet !	819.5826044523403
Elizabeth most thankfully consented , and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay , and bring back a supply of clothes .	11.329541192126587
Gardiner declared his willingness , and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation .	38.55963567101723
CHAPTER XIV .	1311.7971600904
I have no such injuries to resent .	92.97146915171115
but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion , suffered no variation of colour .	16.593267842024385
Oh , Lydia !	750.4108072259855
But now it was all too natural .	100.95797695709804
but he seemed to like his second better .	80.57926779730286
My dear sir , replied Collins , I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship's concurrence .	10.544163310712985
make haste , my love .	270.0730032552941
and he thought it an excellent one , full of eligibility and suitableness , and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part .	14.22062050696873
He enquired in a friendly , though general way , after her family , and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done .	16.7467766216312
and why not to me ?	322.0129999792927
If he fears me , why come hither ?	64.50134077699236
That will make thirteen with ourselves , so there will be just room at table for him .	16.496624526798936
Oh !	3082.833849588038
there were half hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte , and the weather was so fine for the time of year , that she had often great enjoyment out of doors .	13.878050387905077
Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form , he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing ;	10.369539412663782
No officer is ever to enter my house again , nor even to pass through the village .	19.143131463107167
Bennet , in short , was in very great spirits ;	83.14475237626942
As a child I was taught what was right , but I was not taught to correct my temper .	18.18955125914781
he drew back his chair , took a newspaper from the table , and , glancing over it , said , in a colder voice , Are you pleased with Kent ?	13.10470377687406
And there are several of the young men , too , that she likes very much .	31.227366426191992
You are then resolved to have him ?	110.01752204118507
Wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates ;	19.07982618129308
You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I hope , though you have but a short lease .	24.0453291788164
They met again on Sunday , and then I saw him too .	47.370207573643526
and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition .	25.25220932905079
You will not be fit to be seen when you get there .	37.36777503828749
The period of expectation was now doubled .	92.04575192275175
Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject .	29.314276353117727
I am going away myself .	179.45369617242602
that is rather singular .	397.5215268687624
But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed ;	69.52142765834526
It was an encouragement of vice ;	91.40412275811144
Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so , said Collins very gravely but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you .	15.15621044508698
I leave it to yourself to determine , said Bennet .	60.24804771264714
Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the expression of heart-felt delight , diffused over his face , became him ;	8.880296483332183
No .	6870.858175154512
Now , Lizzy , I think I have surprised you .	67.33654550497944
she repeated .	1576.7921445043244
Upon my word , said her Ladyship , you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person .	15.706632092762499
I certainly saw Darcy speaking to her .	96.62393365587216
He did not leave his name , and till the next day , it was only known that a gentleman had called on business .	19.61821268144181
If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other , or ever so similar before-hand , it does not advance their felicity in the least .	11.405348359840506
I see what you are feeling , replied Charlotte , you must be surprised , very much surprised , so lately as Collins was wishing to marry you .	15.334104334266673
But are you pleased , Jane ?	169.0166798107788
do any thing rather than marry without affection .	69.62641637255416
CHAPTER XIX .	1311.7971600904
Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his countenance .	32.59486404098915
Certainly , my dear , nobody said there were ;	62.88171972484653
You know my sentiments .	315.1932380932211
that the young man's marrying her , was a patched-up business , at the expence of your father and uncles .	27.96077146470485
In the intervals of her discourse with Collins , she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth , but especially to the latter , of whose connections she knew the least , and who she observed to Collins , was a very genteel , pretty kind of girl .	9.530093220796529
She talked to Elizabeth again and again ;	117.38527833027544
Miss Bennet had slept ill , and though up , was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room .	24.170918604844204
Lady Catherine it appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings , for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Darcy .	10.510551759881851
How are you all ?	443.9738795020217
How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning , Darcy , she cried ;	39.25012475711181
I should say , one of her ladyship's carriages , for she has several .	42.987217691724005
and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time .	16.538854168912152
How grievous then was the thought that , of a situation so desirable in every respect , so replete with advantage , so promising for happiness , Jane had been deprived , by the folly and indecorum of her own family !	9.76052465892425
for though dilatory in undertaking business , he was quick in its execution .	25.63459457251076
and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet .	17.181584689466565
and if a smart young colonel , with five or six thousand a year , should want one of my girls , I shall not say nay to him ;	10.46560695835761
and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance .	35.74290544564537
I send no compliments to your mother .	86.2180289607757
I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow .	15.02105127690508
Your younger sisters must be very young ?	136.47477836394916
It was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for Longbourn , before she told her sister of Darcy's proposals .	14.67418131504106
Collins , awkward and solemn , apologising instead of attending , and often moving wrong without being aware of it , gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give .	7.813683705222665
But , though this might be imaginary , she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy , who had been set up as a rival of Jane .	15.334449953356232
Now , Kitty , you may cough as much as you chuse , said Bennet ;	30.419473042047876
No , indeed .	714.0350681007563
All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over .	64.22241956510827
Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy .	39.66724368100287
and then , unwilling to let the subject drop , added , He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire , I understand .	17.880690711696676
Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father , their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility .	12.120456053936268
and if she would give him leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them .	22.273339775373312
I should be sorry , you know , to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire .	17.926752196208827
And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry ?	66.06507379701378
But it must not , shall not be .	110.71937149097911
and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park , hurried home with the great intelligence .	17.021916832576366
After abusing you so abominably to your face , I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations .	20.483181920888654
Lizzy , said he , I was going to look for you ;	65.30559454225913
cried Elizabeth , darting from her seat as she finished the letter , in eagerness to follow him , without losing a moment of the time so precious ;	15.177712764998144
Her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction ;	14.813581431149709
From the farther disadvantage of Lydia's society she was of course carefully kept , and though Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her , with the promise of balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going .	9.858686687089095
I do not at all know ;	158.28849123367925
Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield and looked in vain for Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her .	9.21693517364126
Good Heaven !	1450.8423596756263
After playing some Italian songs , Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air ;	16.745297002279692
and when I next write to her , I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account .	21.295387911158304
Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought , said Bennet ;	32.82609152677864
and with many men , I dare say , it succeeds .	59.51474394487846
Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency .	60.504381208455484
Will you be very angry with me , my dear Lizzy , if I take this opportunity of saying ( what I was never bold enough to say before ) how much I like him .	11.117876936851586
and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend .	23.087383486578904
I am glad I bought my bonnet , if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox !	16.797331797852976
That the wish of giving happiness to you , might add force to the other inducements which led me on , I shall not attempt to deny .	16.058046299079713
and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment ;	61.11915453501361
but she , who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible , gaily continued , Oh !	20.512970118276733
Surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement .	75.14104146213651
and in spite of his being a lover , Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity , to be rationally founded , because they had for basis the excellent understanding , and super-excellent disposition of Jane , and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself .	7.413750220455904
CHAPTER XXIII .	1575.3856872474946
On the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband .	38.67514717456572
And who is there , whatever might be their former conduct , that she would believe capable of such an attempt , till it were proved against them ?	13.083098442508465
It was an earnest , steadfast gaze , but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind .	9.826646966726335
I will only add , God bless you .	48.16051645351013
of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance !	108.64313571094668
Wickham , perhaps , is my favourite ;	149.8199625855652
and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage , she may have less trouble in achieving a second ;	11.615896255990597
Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder , and when at last Collins allowed him time to speak , replied with an air of distant civility .	13.37342548430236
But , my dear , your father cannot spare the horses , I am sure .	23.515977428511903
His complexion became pale with anger , and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature .	20.261145486337483
It would be such a delicious scheme , and I dare say would hardly cost any thing at all .	20.269284598758684
She would not give him time to reply , but hurrying instantly to her husband , called out as she entered the library , Oh !	16.51970424957223
mamma , do the people here abouts know I am married to-day ?	35.80262894477933
She is well , and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother .	40.57900348608735
Oh !	3082.833849588038
A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe .	13.604656812623881
Perhaps she is full young to be much in company .	68.35665432720926
I know very well that nothing can be done .	56.28641437472153
She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool ;	72.3522927245634
Bennet , how can you abuse your own children in such a way ?	35.63840015699399
You refuse to obey the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude .	29.064414977041242
It is a circumstance which Darcy of course would not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady's family , it would be an unpleasant thing .	13.130877303294177
but to say the truth , I was too cross to write .	63.2664225992686
that she is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference , and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him , she means ( most kindly ) to put me on my guard ?	11.580745949051373
for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ;	12.891920274056462
You have no regard , then , for the honour and credit of my nephew !	36.43748596993082
There was no arguing upon such a project .	74.19968184856137
But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue , she could easily conjecture .	7.67329645549864
But the person who advanced , was now near enough to see her , and stepping forward with eagerness , pronounced her name .	14.692509222073632
As she went up stairs to get ready , Bennet followed her , saying , I am quite sorry , Lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself .	12.344490241684149
He heard her with astonishment .	194.48734601925966
but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets , she soon grew too much interested in the game , too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes , to have attention for any one in particular .	7.702488847599821
She is my youngest girl but one .	82.82990518041846
Lydia came to us ;	522.1242390515168
Every body was surprised ;	360.0120646098269
Her performance on the piano-forte is exquisite .	95.29525782671293
Elizabeth , construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister , was pleased ;	25.26156010213109
I did hear , too , that there was a time , when sermon-making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present ;	21.080631427381324
I must find Gardiner this moment , on business that cannot be delayed ;	31.214970761926764
And with a low bow he left her to attack Darcy , whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched , and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident .	11.679331195689
she had no conversation , no style , no taste , no beauty .	44.04702733390214
If your feelings are still what they were last April , tell me so at once .	18.838070332494052
In pompous nothings on his side , and civil assents on that of his cousins , their time passed till they entered Meryton .	14.737955905161941
and in his manner of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment , reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh , and trusting their opinion of her their opinion of every body would always coincide , there was a solicitude , an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard ;	6.868888657749162
Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case , unknown to the society of Hertfordshire ;	15.123229576989642
Bingley and Jane were standing together , a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other .	26.188106533857738
Does that young lady know Darcy ?	111.57833552541852
I shall not sport with your impatience , by reading what he says on that point .	19.175725373381507
But whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ;	12.074419402822253
That such a consequence as this should ensue , you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts .	14.77365061885091
Pray tell your sister that I long to see her .	57.54832135506961
A single man of large fortune ;	117.20526877189026
It was the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton , and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace .	23.579258921492233
and if they are not married already , make them marry .	45.09089908320564
and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend .	21.10248489774206
Her father captivated by youth and beauty , and that appearance of good humour , which youth and beauty generally give , had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind , had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her .	7.189493696518299
and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men .	13.195567773225422
My good , kind brother !	184.09459052639744
Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character , but said nothing .	43.83616024554611
If my children are silly I must hope to be always sensible of it .	26.647381907013845
It was the favourite wish of his mother , as well as of her's .	37.422350187837594
How could I be so silly as to wish it !	57.38907136744857
Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you , as his father did before him ?	29.17559696093105
The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family .	47.769224732271226
In another minute Bingley , but without seeming to have noticed what passed , took leave and rode on with his friend .	14.345489603052997
I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family .	16.998460336385254
I can readily believe , answered he gravely , that report may vary greatly with respect to me ;	14.977693731256677
Perhaps other people have said so before , but not one with such justice .	33.74916741783552
I speak feelingly .	626.0561197839756
Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth , this was not the best method of recommending herself ;	23.08849130457743
I did not know before , continued Bingley immediately , that you were a studier of character .	23.074170820936846
Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ;	200.4664361097306
I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for I am fond of superior society ;	20.18537432330205
I always had a value for him .	102.93230645779278
You will easily comprehend , from these particulars , that Wickham's circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be .	17.98845463226018
and Jane , who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience , from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit , was delighted at her entrance .	10.903852087455
My dear Friend , If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me , we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives , for a whole day's t te- -t te between two women can never end without a quarrel .	6.758926674625189
Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife .	51.10609368602666
She is a great deal too ill to be moved .	52.163664056722354
On distinguishing the ladies of the group , the two gentlemen came directly towards them , and began the usual civilities .	20.601620207241844
You could scarcely escape discredit and misery .	65.1183925947601
They stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece , who , astonished and confused , scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face , and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family .	8.172296806218641
Elizabeth made no answer .	243.71117643293454
They were forced to conclude , that he had no pleasing intelligence to send , but even of that they would have been glad to be certain .	16.956856696528558
One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight .	39.38884410397644
I do not believe a word of it , my dear .	47.40315798970149
we must forget it ourselves .	170.33802640688688
And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman .	16.236706286706944
Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party .	51.549909266713826
What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory , and as she recalled his very words , it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other ;	10.814548985404679
They now walked on in silence ;	123.8718479074064
Jane resolutely kept her place at the table ;	81.41707209305602
then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms .	39.65946245897981
Are you going much farther ?	139.20412038651656
I have met with two instances lately ;	84.84126783109647
I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy .	50.55243906915244
for I dare not hope , he continued in a lower and more serious tone , that he is improved in essentials .	19.291651898981538
Do you often dance at James's ?	115.58166767075703
In anticipating the happiness of Bingley , which of course was to be inferior only to his own , he continued the conversation till they reached the house .	16.916844247023477
Indeed , Bennet , said she , it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that I should be forced to make way for her , and live to see her take my place in it !	11.274374091887498
And Mary King is safe !	170.40921524817435
Jane ran to her uncle and aunt , and welcomed and thanked them both , with alternate smiles and tears .	18.070254292431446
By all means , cried Bingley ;	155.10729230846152
After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence , health , good humour and cheerfulness began to re-appear at Longbourn .	15.258480574651022
and Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again , whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them .	11.175277076824154
Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off .	41.15302172743554
if he were so , they could not succeed .	122.34687161697312
her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances , and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else Darcy was condemned as the worst of men .	7.573298566163796
In a few days Bingley returned Bennet's visit , and sat about ten minutes with him in his library .	19.44907029933891
and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister , and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them .	9.49993229933046
Besides , there was truth in his looks .	90.6311262157364
but at any rate , was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal .	36.744643652120935
were questions with which she amused herself .	88.57524060642018
I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind .	45.020728022478494
But , however , he is very welcome to come to Netherfield , if he likes it .	29.892448776819595
A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty ;	16.47799847427717
But Gardiner , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in her hopes as her fears ;	15.470692660170357
She then hastened away to her mother , who had purposely broken up the card party , and was sitting up stairs with Kitty .	15.330173957018056
and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Denny , to whom Lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned ;	9.925796948123708
but to her own more extensive information , he was the person , to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as what Jane felt for Bingley .	9.514932952739406
What would I give to hear your strictures on them !	39.26785052174343
Lizzy , said he , what are you doing ?	72.1067617520825
You will find her manners beyond any thing I can describe ;	38.19589474798936
I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had .	62.593105266400215
What an agreeable man Sir William is , Bingley is not he ?	48.96308768469729
I always said it must be so , at last .	68.09566825198205
People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking .	18.00061018066331
Though Lydia had never been a favourite with them , and Gardiner could not but be deeply affected .	25.901585025390553
But so they always are .	154.71756997783424
But to be sure , the good lady who shewed us the house , did give him a most flaming character !	19.951117871254368
He was most highly esteemed by Darcy , a most intimate , confidential friend .	28.053392972337686
Not to appear to disgrace his family , to degenerate from the popular qualities , or lose the influence of the Pemberley House , is a powerful motive .	13.62971313200978
It is too long ago .	198.30858621924344
No , my dear ;	419.2982737234493
Annesley is with her .	327.19560480007164
Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they admired her and liked her , and pronounced her to be a sweet girl , and one whom they should not object to know more of .	12.171684648844785
but since he had been in the militia , it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them .	18.07197635516427
I do not believe Long will do any such thing .	38.50871289734544
Ten thousand a year !	309.021628205604
but allow me to assure you that I have your respected mother's permission for this address .	25.347207325456786
Darcy sends you all the love in the world , that he can spare from me .	30.450471327113938
Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk , they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance , and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance .	11.410830379151735
Yes ;	4459.007412392422
Is not he a charming man ?	120.24603068870405
Oh , Lizzy !	706.061916680351
I came to try you .	227.1312138340436
Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes .	80.77798368111394
His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same , said Elizabeth angrily ;	26.00719490126833
which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption , she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister , had been formed before he quitted the inn , and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there , had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend .	7.605098689634776
You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing .	39.25230758894693
We shall be at Newcastle all the winter , and I dare say there will be some balls , and I will take care to get good partners for them all .	12.492170976815501
They have known her much longer than they have known me ;	36.31550837934537
What say you , Mary ?	302.89013251547937
and Charlotte , detained first by the civility of Collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear .	10.265054376167322
She was at least free from the offence of Darcy's farther notice ;	38.533186308362396
and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close ;	13.234901944504832
Read it aloud , said their father , for I hardly know myself what it is about .	27.11717056231162
But really , Ma'am , I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters , that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early .	9.587880610430895
The present always occupies you in such scenes does it ?	37.155668953719996
You do not look well .	228.45228521578426
Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this , but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head .	22.678369636409446
You are severe on us .	157.02987394136474
and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me , because you have always so much .	19.61801208038525
Very true , my dear , that is exactly what I say .	50.63782114764447
Collins was punctual to his time , and was received with great politeness by the whole family .	29.867408220807867
One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man , with family , fortune , every thing in his favour , should think highly of himself .	14.828399880355883
and if you persist in indifference , do not make me your confidante .	28.38525767775274
and when occasionally , unable to resist the impulse of curiosity , she raised her eyes to his face , she as often found him looking at Jane , as at herself , and frequently on no object but the ground .	9.090544664110869
My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this .	40.49062498219547
Elizabeth longed to explore its windings ;	93.83709392993893
and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of , she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours .	12.79605354884174
You are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room , said Darcy , looking at the eldest Miss Bennet .	25.739781734839628
But you are always giving her the preference .	93.77533089409135
I am confident that she would have performed delightfully .	60.453273522523006
You shall not defend her , though it is Charlotte Lucas .	66.70549352737771
Darcy is impatient to see his sister , and to confess the truth , we are scarcely less eager to meet her again .	17.8797755821472
After this period , every appearance of acquaintance was dropt .	41.770085400630684
As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not , she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind .	14.38666394313477
how I wanted you !	276.9118418911003
She wrote again when the visit was paid , and she had seen Miss Bingley .	31.982451330286565
This cannot be !	861.1526794554889
What think you of books ?	206.60016551061835
But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them .	41.61453754741519
And yours , he replied with a smile , is wilfully to misunderstand them .	29.692463631325218
His accompanying them was a double advantage ;	87.4401149921432
and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness .	18.51366802452305
On such encouragement to ask , Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away .	22.24079087306051
While these newly-born notions were passing in their heads , the perturbation of Elizabeth's feelings was every moment increasing .	12.394839521543146
This letter is from Collins .	212.00844025179987
Darcy , on the contrary , had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion , for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest , and from none received either attention or pleasure .	9.553972471563354
but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas .	20.09370031150741
his society was irksome , and his attachment to her must be imaginary .	43.95124957614721
It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ;	14.822916001133631
Bingley replied that he did , and made his congratulations .	71.54859970910545
Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at Brighton .	18.655856282301755
But that gentleman , looking at Darcy , seemed to think the country was nothing at all .	29.574010850187662
An airing would do me a great deal of good , I am sure .	26.686243583161193
Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew ;	52.84267224754664
and on her pausing , he asked her , if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends .	27.349666367096482
and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her , the worth of each was eclipsed by Bingley and Netherfield .	14.93099960879804
No , nothing at all .	202.19933936018785
The turn of your countenance I shall never forget , as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way , that would induce you to accept me .	13.820841619088768
Yes , almost every day .	201.1697308919153
but Bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished , was excessively disappointed .	22.87818689221561
I desire you will stay where you are .	69.73261054996634
though their kindness to Jane , such as it was , had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration .	16.665482354414134
How could his will be disregarded ?	138.83625612721067
Collins readily assented , and a book was produced ;	64.62172709251465
Darcy corroborated it with a bow , and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth , when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger , and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other , was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting .	9.882645655191885
It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now .	55.15454053385625
She dared not relate the other half of Darcy's letter , nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend .	15.269019941236646
On entering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo , and was immediately invited to join them ;	19.227762131898373
Lydia , my love , though you are the youngest , I dare say Bingley will dance with you at the next ball .	23.593414385079207
The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth .	44.18579400550668
She was sorry that Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them ;	14.331760725774743
The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , cake , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ;	7.897041306934691
She had always seen it with pain ;	94.27082445116548
I cannot do justice to his kindness .	99.84648491422746
Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party .	37.48997304429772
Your conjecture is totally wrong , I assure you .	57.1848438464875
and Lydia , self-willed and careless , would scarcely give them a hearing .	25.22859457356982
Hurst looked at her with astonishment .	163.00973711725183
As soon as ever Bingley comes , my dear , said Bennet , you will wait on him of course .	20.192106766942857
Indeed I do not dare .	241.91700755284836
But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence .	60.395439064173885
But she is perfectly amiable , and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies .	15.054881152067392
and she thought , more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire , than as she had seen him at Pemberley .	21.121215367429333
to Miss Lydia Bennet , ' without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or any thing .	18.638589682496765
but satisfying them instantly on that head , she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons , reading the two letters aloud , and dwelling on the postscript of the last , with trembling energy .	11.537114878252858
I should like balls infinitely better , she replied , if they were carried on in a different manner ;	25.33550427091818
and as Miss Bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to Wickham , Georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more .	10.188852268229242
He can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear .	41.246678076507315
There was too much to be thought ;	173.84309605776866
and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind , wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite .	8.422321043925557
What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant ?	32.18373504756966
But my dearest love , tell me what dish Darcy is particularly fond of , that I may have it to-morrow .	18.487310247474532
My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect .	23.310932251202313
I dare say I shall soon see them here .	54.968982645746074
While the family were in this confusion , Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them .	26.09598090919529
and in the nearness of the Parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lived in it , the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day .	12.965622936646177
while his sisters , convinced that no country advice could be of any service , recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians .	12.63023561977434
She was overpowered by shame and vexation .	64.4865828308808
Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town ;	57.999271449155515
there is nothing in that .	345.49243033568484
Why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ?	24.863963519641754
Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow , and though she could not hear a word of it , she felt as if hearing it all , and saw in the motion of his lips the words apology , Hunsford , and Lady Catherine de Bourgh .	10.383733299316097
and when the subject was revived the next morning , and she was again applied to , could readily answer , and with a proper air of indifference , that she had not really any dislike to the scheme .	13.540930949803546
and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints , they parted ;	34.15534288778196
For God's sake , say no more of his partners .	56.14633848488482
Whatever he said , was said well ;	144.0055614849987
They are gone off together from Brighton .	66.30519598425292
He knows of my being in town , I am certain , from something she said herself ;	25.24559404022269
He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant .	82.67023174662354
The prospect of such delights was very cheering , and they parted in mutual good spirits .	23.496166382263624
she still expected that it would all end well , and that every morning would bring some letter , either from Lydia or her father , to explain their proceedings , and perhaps announce the marriage .	10.001336859570936
Perhaps he had been civil , only because he felt himself at ease ;	33.51511167790964
and indeed I am quite of your opinion .	111.56683514078854
he will rant and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter .	23.75736007061026
Lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in Bingley's way .	29.415032912236956
You may remember what I told you on that point , when first we talked of it .	23.14652397706802
And they must marry !	335.113655384915
Consider how important every moment is , in such a case .	49.781274601999925
From something that he told me in our journey hither , I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him .	18.844516176879118
Indeed , Collins , all praise of me will be unnecessary .	58.02870866743079
I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well , when she came into the room this morning .	23.121998148666464
My conduct may I fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own .	10.59005168967239
his style was not penitent , but haughty .	92.21545070674229
And even Mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it .	27.355052867095967
and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it .	38.377127707344535
Though she dared not depend upon the consequence , she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour .	21.12732769450844
On being made acquainted with the present Darcy's treatment of him , she tried to remember something of that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad , which might agree with it , and was confident at last , that she recollected having heard Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud , ill-natured boy .	6.878872863902494
To all the objections I have already urged , I have still another to add .	27.17541776583378
There was another reason too for her opposition .	69.36761390326434
for she only came , I suppose , to tell us the Collinses were well .	35.249213550299956
I am only resolved to act in that manner , which will , in my own opinion , constitute my happiness , without reference to you , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me .	13.055211789656378
'Ah !	6847.919774710029
She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved .	51.21751610704094
He has also brotherly pride , which with some brotherly affection , makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister ;	13.864925929900243
but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them ;	15.292107962038955
It was generally evident whenever they met , that he did admire her ;	30.211358161148038
as we went along , Kitty and me drew up all the blinds , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ;	17.904608677117626
I am talking of possibilities , Charles .	79.86570541818766
because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth .	27.918013278342585
Mama , cried Lydia , my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they first came ;	14.740792244958206
You have said quite enough , madam .	97.94011139322355
Brighton , and a whole campful of soldiers , to us , who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia , and the monthly balls of Meryton .	11.510200156737046
He readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for her distress , wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope , and leaving his compliments for her relations , with only one serious , parting , look , went away .	8.561037920253492
and unwilling for her sister's sake , to provoke him , she only said in reply , with a good-humoured smile , Come , Wickham , we are brother and sister , you know .	15.015654384289435
As he spoke there was a sort of smile , which Elizabeth fancied she understood ;	29.854307511384643
E below .	1571.4439182596846
And she rose as she spoke .	160.9473545344008
Well !	6881.414585761612
There is nothing else to be done .	122.88327281213957
His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece ;	34.57846341970717
But she had never felt so strongly as now , the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage , nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents ;	7.285361550295228
I thought too ill of him , to invite him to Pemberley , or admit his society in town .	23.075670694757157
But while he was mortal , there must be a triumph .	52.92036860344581
I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest , there is no occasion for any thing more .	13.815738718045573
It is a great comfort to have you so rich , and when you have nothing else to do , I hope you will think of us .	21.112482212309676
Do not distress me by the idea .	118.99120378418131
Nothing is more deceitful , said Darcy , than the appearance of humility .	39.080991717050466
Jane was not deceived , but she was affected ;	98.78261695087795
and if you lament over him much longer , my heart will be as light as a feather .	20.01722230212622
It is a pity they are not handsome !	83.06689280808158
what is it about ?	486.2867437069258
But Jane and Elizabeth , who agreed in wishing , for the sake of their sister's feelings and consequence , that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents , urged him so earnestly , yet so rationally and so mildly , to receive her and her husband at Longbourn , as soon as they were married , that he was prevailed on to think as they thought , and act as they wished .	7.907398739234598
Her face is too thin ;	157.8472511796529
Their visits to Philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence .	32.97607813363928
of what are you thinking ?	273.77425447150875
It was in the Times and the Courier , I know ;	77.99035475706489
and fourthly , that the match might be broken off .	63.71193851274363
She felt that Jane's feelings , though fervent , were little displayed , and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner , not often united with great sensibility .	11.487171707928873
I must not decide on my own performance .	92.01756462563021
Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible ;	12.683741998479356
but when Philips understood from him what Rosings was , and who was its proprietor , when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms , and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all the force of the compliment , and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper's room .	8.071155785450959
There is nothing the matter with me .	83.31705470104558
And as to laughter , we will not expose ourselves , if you please , by attempting to laugh without a subject .	18.041243782425273
Here again I shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell .	25.07324492655043
Well , Colonel Fitzwilliam , what do I play next ?	44.70494454844813
Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp , and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table , and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley's .	11.509668536347265
He shall be mercenary , and she shall be foolish .	72.75571567824572
They were all of them warm in their admiration ;	68.17725469921827
These recollections will not do at all .	114.19714723911075
secondly , she was very sure that Collins had been taken in ;	55.725368225495174
The garden sloping to the road , the house standing in it , the green pales and the laurel hedge , every thing declared they were arriving .	16.0708684302585
Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption , while the servants remained .	26.404871952169366
Human nature is so prone to fall into it !	49.07656013897399
Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions , all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US unless a copyright notice is included .	7.328461912342987
Never mind Miss Lizzy's hair .	136.8990415958044
Wickham will soon be gone ;	192.83597999693504
but , stopping on his approach , received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome .	21.26574151931426
Oh !	3082.833849588038
Had Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle , she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself ;	13.992430617438924
Collins was also in the same state of angry pride .	57.950173529555464
Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered .	60.8903649182012
The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon , and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her that she was not enough recovered ;	13.010377265163303
and I find that the young man forgot to tell you , among his other communications , that he was the son of old Wickham , the late Darcy's steward .	13.689114905240729
But nothing can be done ;	259.56068649940676
but Elizabeth , to satisfy her mother , went to the window she looked , she saw Darcy with him , and sat down again by her sister .	20.020493880657554
He then sat down by her , and talked scarcely to any one else .	37.22934184592436
Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject .	41.57750602894225
How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day !	18.90529503523564
and if she might judge from his complexion , his mind was not very differently engaged .	27.07644707585993
I have not been accustomed to such language as this .	39.87912936335647
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection .	34.790997720276174
It was rather small , but well built and convenient ;	38.59248695615922
but Bennet was firm : it soon led to another ;	49.08419633556179
Next time you call , said she , I hope we shall be more lucky .	26.27072384802033
CHAPTER X Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter , as soon as she possibly could .	22.481605074902724
This preservative she had now obtained ;	154.92045282223287
Every thing , however , went on smoothly , and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch .	20.882265623847726
I was uncomfortable enough .	290.7925902708704
Gardiner , who was several years younger than Bennet and Philips , was an amiable , intelligent , elegant woman , and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces .	13.793869923618221
Yes ;	4459.007412392422
Undoubtedly .	6847.919774710029
Darcy smiled and said , You are perfectly right .	59.268158273985826
I wish I could call her amiable .	76.90066140430777
He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere , if not with equal regard .	20.893875108513665
but it is wholly out of my power .	116.34442307307738
There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter , which promises well .	24.637280017156193
This idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view ;	22.415505615311595
it must be my uncle's doings !	165.6260711484884
Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother , on her ladyship's entrance , though no request of introduction had been made .	20.347020464715634
He was fond of the country and of books ;	97.61935412595717
and in her postscript it was added , that if Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer , she could spare them very well .	19.235358686986096
How so ?	1610.730506465438
He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment , on account of some debts of honour , which were very pressing ;	19.882266593393336
They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation ;	16.85188118211674
Bingley was the principal spokesman , and Miss Bennet the principal object .	62.47103452039027
She blushed at the very idea ;	183.40553138709186
He is indeed but considering the inducement , my dear Miss Eliza , we cannot wonder at his complaisance ;	14.937991245469982
When they were all in the drawing-room , the questions which Elizabeth had already asked , were of course repeated by the others , and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give .	15.561782425867875
But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour ;	118.13427714618051
I should imagine not .	301.554721809929
Darcy , you see , is the man !	162.12658774214322
Probably not ;	1607.376976114387
there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home , how she would like Lady Catherine , and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be ;	15.282818331621764
You may as well call it impertinence at once .	48.42429108001703
Away ran the girls , too eager to get in to have time for speech .	26.04805850357705
The insipidity and yet the noise ;	120.85405555249847
and from this time Bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them .	29.158429299757394
and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again .	16.69154274762004
and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world , he was caught by their easy playfulness .	17.49871989075653
Darcy , as well as Elizabeth , really loved them ;	68.09804285651803
It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends .	20.794471543395932
She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas , who often joined them , and good-naturedly engaged Collins's conversation to herself .	14.42521940546455
In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health , imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better .	11.388061488554902
Jane was distressed .	619.686180022978
My kind friends will not hear of my returning home till I am better .	32.312081044469345
what news ?	1703.4193621392305
for the curiosity excited by his long absence , burst forth in such very direct questions on his return , as required some ingenuity to evade , and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial , for he was longing to publish his prosperous love .	7.209068883199112
She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened ;	46.4583646992744
She will not be able to help calling .	82.99958841686794
His character sunk on every review of it ;	56.83613337695635
said he ;	2177.7502436427067
Eliza Bennet , said Miss Bingley , when the door was closed on her , is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex , by undervaluing their own ;	14.197274909481292
On both sides it was only assertion .	116.71050549122721
though perhaps it was lucky for her husband , who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form , that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly .	11.011388562352193
Their society can afford no pleasure , that will atone for such wretchedness as this !	25.96561610013118
Let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied .	37.77423596214036
no .	6081.1008001417185
He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood ;	28.895142073607364
We seem to have been designed for each other .	59.57536359590397
I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your's .	36.90664597915743
Where is your sister ?	498.4039669193437
I did for you .	332.0411193852098
Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand ;	39.996515268166
and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months .	77.50479149755756
Easter was approaching , and the week preceding it , was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings , which in so small a circle must be important .	15.028123831884777
There was certainly at this moment , in Elizabeth's mind , a more gentle sensation towards the original , than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance .	14.300165115550938
As he quitted the room , Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire ;	9.046891989682466
indeed , you must have seen it in the papers .	97.88983953098835
I can answer your question , said Fitzwilliam , without applying to him .	35.716856887776196
In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother , though expressed most concisely , he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done , and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him .	8.360401122744609
nor could she for a moment repent her refusal , or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again .	14.150658600478124
And so saying , he turned back with them , and walked towards the house .	36.146323783645755
How can they suit each other ?	126.05397049879565
Oh !	3082.833849588038
Can he be a sensible man , sir ?	78.95324301387524
Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room , to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself .	16.115152424362332
But , my dear Elizabeth , she added , what sort of girl is Miss King ?	30.81153364637515
But , however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination , I do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage , had it not been seconded by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving , of your sister's indifference .	8.467955800671318
Do not wish me such an evil .	106.03750159836592
But there was much to be talked of , in marrying her ;	59.88298219479515
He begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother ;	41.29491040444608
At length , quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book , which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his , she gave a great yawn and said , How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way !	10.970568261159935
To Caroline's assertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit .	20.55490393646355
and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt , than to run such a risk .	26.395209851758644
I rather wished , than believed him to be sincere ;	60.699675637173335
He heard her attentively , and then said , Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances .	8.611975574731954
Elizabeth could bear it no longer .	135.44520082377886
I assure you , that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it .	32.63583121526245
Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual .	81.91756888433646
If they had uncles enough to fill all Cheapside , cried Bingley , it would not make them one jot less agreeable .	15.76506767900988
Both , replied Elizabeth archly ;	209.8734494699372
You have now done your duty by her , and must fret no longer .	26.801031469055978
but if she is really headstrong and foolish , I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state .	11.777612790829068
Elizabeth , equally next to Jane in birth and beauty , succeeded her of course .	23.405125562027894
and the gown which had been let down to hide it , not doing its office .	25.056236665350077
Let me be rightly understood .	137.83321198892156
Because honour , decorum , prudence , nay , interest , forbid it .	19.374770181388175
and she seized the opportunity of saying , Is your sister at Pemberley still ?	26.95810700001853
on Tuesday , his wife received a letter from him ;	62.76717446641827
It was acknowledged , however , that he was a liberal man , and did much good among the poor .	21.15749836800892
The first wish of my heart , said she to herself , is never more to be in company with either of them .	23.245700657047298
in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and I dare say it would succeed , if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way .	17.85726766118716
Darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence .	67.7127773692223
she had seen enough of Bingley's behaviour to Jane , to be convinced that she would get him at last ;	27.466367178151437
About the Court , such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon .	25.388710141208186
I have not an instant to lose .	95.17031869867797
Don't think me angry , however , for I only mean to let you know , that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side .	12.225276292825532
Bennet was quite disconcerted .	346.897775816075
A lively imagination soon settled it all .	73.90732979289628
E7 and any additional terms imposed by the copyright holder .	39.89435433085851
He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem .	26.56936569750387
When my eyes were opened to his real character .	49.98360549680793
Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged , by the scarcity of gentlemen , to sit down for two dances ;	26.049047298215747
How strange this is !	333.3519657856252
what felicity !	1592.1098756399153
I should be glad to take a turn in it , if you will favour me with your company .	22.512526763887056
and I was convinced of her affection .	202.9665081332029
Her home and her housekeeping , her parish and her poultry , and all their dependent concerns , had not yet lost their charms .	15.074724400333743
and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls ;	15.308458960162973
They soon outstripped the others , and when they had reached the carriage , and Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind .	19.966420371531203
But if he returns no more this winter , my choice will never be required .	25.66698866329939
Your first position is false .	135.48982007456985
and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him .	19.833520737742973
Five daughters brought up at home without a governess !	55.5594796151102
What does Darcy mean , said she to Charlotte , by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster ?	22.863320112430852
There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men .	25.848486793202504
I will go directly to Bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , I am sure .	22.132050332470413
She smiled , but made no answer .	115.84849173855592
As to his real character , had information been in her power , she had never felt a wish of enquiring .	23.412559258725068
Darcy was delighted with their engagement ;	162.40790000829287
Bingley had danced with her twice , and she had been distinguished by his sisters .	37.93724407902112
But if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal it , he must find it out .	22.21071698062291
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged , every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him .	11.513511716597703
- You provide , in accordance with paragraph 1 .	48.31499763748475
and , as he had likewise foretold , he took his seat at the bottom of the table , by her ladyship's desire , and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater .	13.48959189678277
A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her , a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude , and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter .	8.5317435997341
Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile , but Elizabeth could not return it .	36.44816790400993
It would have been strange if they had .	91.84076133404047
every thing must sink under such a proof of family weakness , such an assurance of the deepest disgrace .	19.77826164100264
She has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject , to give greater what shall I call it ?	13.56873599930792
and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance , especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again .	12.794649901763764
When the ladies returned to the drawing-room , there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk , which she did without any intermission till coffee came in , delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted .	8.046824066889183
And her neighbours at Lucas lodge , therefore , ( for through their communication with the Collinses , the report she concluded had reached lady Catherine ) had only set that down , as almost certain and immediate , which she had looked forward to as possible , at some future time .	5.740215409203911
I really cannot laugh at it .	122.46501814131011
The Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan S Fairbanks , AK , 99712 .	10.599201223530057
the door was thrown open , and she ran into the room .	37.539558641545185
Perhaps this concealment , this disguise , was beneath me .	44.54470975357554
Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion , and complimented her on bearing it so well .	17.61430391035619
But , my dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me obstinate if I still assert , that , considering what her behaviour was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion .	8.64815851454202
Do you suppose them to be in London ?	107.84069561358865
Once or twice she could discern a faint blush ;	46.31937167442772
But , however , that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here , I am determined .	24.201817594894294
But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into , was shortly relieved , and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope , by an article of news , which then began to be in circulation .	10.148751342574272
Can I speak plainer ?	307.6875249984855
Some time or other he will be but it shall not be by me .	34.35671437085281
As they went down stairs together , Charlotte said , I shall depend on hearing from you very often , Eliza .	17.87677068536142
I have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse .	38.863563746173746
By nature inoffensive , friendly and obliging , his presentation at James's had made him courteous .	14.205516491791654
he had looked at her without admiration at the ball ;	70.40076565346455
But , in my opinion , it is a paltry device , a very mean art .	35.32257261418803
His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear .	28.638177113275688
She must own that she was tired of great houses ;	47.760182218006676
But if it be only a slight , thin sort of inclination , I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away .	11.803401329537342
Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us , which becomes herself and daughter .	14.495023197029342
Laugh as much as you chuse , but you will not laugh me out of my opinion .	30.451033598273145
What do I not owe you !	90.3896293275383
Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies ;	33.771468712250616
There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire .	40.08566915658821
It is excellent news , capital news , and about a certain person that we all like .	19.21515759657542
you sly thing !	562.3223053690325
On Miss Lucas's persevering , however , she added , Very well ;	33.14710499007635
I found , said he , as the time drew near , that I had better not meet Darcy ;	23.447265630942233
She then read the first sentence aloud , which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly , and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street , where Hurst had a house .	8.585930609930886
but his father's uncommon attachment to me , irritated him I believe very early in life .	21.307537551156297
Elizabeth hoped she had silenced him ;	146.79404675857919
You want to tell me , and I have no objection to hearing it .	44.38263229237062
Amongst the most violent against him was Bennet , whose dislike of his general behaviour , was sharpened into particular resentment , by his having slighted one of her daughters .	14.33432914741891
Yes , Ma'am , that he was indeed ;	97.50979380420863
In consequence of an agreement between the sisters , Elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother , to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day .	16.2728019046018
With his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous , contained much good sense and solid reasoning .	9.532602746929054
Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education , and who has lived in the world , is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers ?	12.296319440638475
On Sunday , after morning service , the separation , so agreeable to almost all , took place .	23.572694777331627
As a brother , a landlord , a master , she considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship !	22.741678271390935
You shall have it in few words .	108.20473948604389
I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden , and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter !	20.026830619139474
In such an exigence my uncle's advice and assistance would be every thing in the world ;	23.059040284954413
So much the better .	290.9841751384544
And tell my dear Lydia , not to give any directions about her clothes , till she has seen me , for she does not know which are the best warehouses .	13.64824353252383
On Saturday he came again .	187.2651080032314
but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way , and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow evening .	11.91765337482884
Yet in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin Elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may incur , by a precipitate closure with this gentleman's proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of .	9.812438428066724
it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Bingley's being there ;	20.435046874757667
There is a gentleman with him , mamma , said Kitty ;	57.638553440440326
The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her .	12.544540984521333
After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event , which Elizabeth considered as all but certain , and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible ;	14.213515610021787
Lydia the humiliation , the misery , she was bringing on them all , soon swallowed up every private care ;	17.594129770351312
Go , my dear , cried her mother , and shew her ladyship about the different walks .	24.889612083764032
Lady Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes , and consideration for his comfort , appeared very remarkable .	20.847825731746457
it remains to be told why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where I assure you there are many amiable young women .	11.266111308940198
and he afterwards took occasion to ask her , when unattended to by any of the rest , whether all her sisters were at Longbourn .	18.12167269699263
But I was embarrassed .	388.8867216925622
A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern .	63.9783316224834
It cannot be done too much ;	194.82405014641216
Elizabeth , with a triumphant sensation , looked towards his friend .	35.518029894470075
Are you out of your senses , to be accepting this man ?	47.505453983424296
Oh !	3082.833849588038
So much the better .	290.9841751384544
Oh !	3082.833849588038
Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint ;	19.944865173178528
But he is a liberal master , I suppose , and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue .	25.31009578002879
I shall see her in January .	160.8033790185106
and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married .	12.348097490364362
He has a very satirical eye , and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself , I shall soon grow afraid of him .	14.477606260161558
Elizabeth , who knew this to be levelled at Darcy , was in such misery of shame , that she could hardly keep her seat .	18.46520025939509
how I should like to be married before any of you ;	73.50349185702922
It must be his own doing .	210.40783267992435
Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment , and then replied , The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind .	21.42744636530433
Bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Darcy ;	20.120690320012333
and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress ;	36.53145345021376
They then went away .	291.93094030040123
Their reception at home was most kind .	106.59880377457064
There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again ;	44.19481159567473
Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast , and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before .	20.555346402023222
I must speak to Hill , this moment .	83.57027176715131
But I know the foundation is unjust .	90.91594914296644
It was absolutely necessary , therefore , to think of something , and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in Hertfordshire , and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure , she observed , How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November , Darcy !	7.89839350648325
Darcy is not to be laughed at !	150.5877008215564
The party did not supply much conversation .	95.18815557807385
But do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us ?	36.30927898270238
Having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and from her age and disposition , greater steadiness than first attachments often boast ;	8.753120970718376
Pleased with the preference of one , and offended by the neglect of the other , on the very beginning of our acquaintance , I have courted prepossession and ignorance , and driven reason away , where either were concerned .	13.74528189217955
When alone with Elizabeth afterwards , she spoke more on the subject .	39.36688272534473
Never , since reading Jane's second letter , had she entertained a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her .	17.179408604635363
gave her hand with an affectionate smile to Wickham , who followed his lady , and wished them both joy , with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness .	12.407489946023757
and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ;	17.4841968504759
We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect .	26.25033095564606
and , therefore , I am not afraid of speaking openly .	44.571704620260626
He then shut the door , and coming up to her , claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister .	19.44176283451325
and it might strike them that they could be more economically , though less expeditiously , married in London , than in Scotland .	14.816678970259298
Is it not clear enough ?	179.09855546934853
and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes ;	38.03982435415351
His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case , but his reliance on mine , made every thing easy .	11.865902156643656
She looked at his two sisters , and saw them making signs of derision at each other , and at Darcy , who continued however impenetrably grave .	12.743177727316562
and , after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table , they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper , who attended , in the absence of her daughters .	14.471250660574972
He was very fond of them .	165.50562524698373
And you may be certain that when I have the honour of seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualifications .	15.05885298290871
She was not rendered formidable by silence ;	76.86805377342579
It was , on the contrary , exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes ;	24.977078555619126
Do you really think so ?	192.04512138081722
I owe all that I know of it , to another , not to you .	58.776184223534514
CHAPTER XV .	1311.7971600904
A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little .	88.26290370483677
but she was flattered and pleased .	118.35534777305348
She attracted him more than he liked and Miss Bingley was uncivil to her , and more teazing than usual to himself .	15.743516628212692
And what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her ?	37.871093367245166
Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness , openness , ductility of his temper , though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own , and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied .	8.909099192891889
In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable , and Jane to make her resigned .	31.330202882392815
But perhaps Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle .	16.975028799530975
Very true , indeed ;	410.70913729430055
Her performance was pleasing , though by no means capital .	46.83210617024492
What are we to do !	188.7988193868256
I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner .	23.49223241433797
and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark .	26.73929015047968
and when Wickham walked into the room , Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before , nor thinking of him since , with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration .	12.805627558230746
Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy , drawn when she was only eight years old .	20.564857832867844
Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail .	32.92291724872655
what it contains , has surprised me a good deal .	46.89246490289342
it will then be early enough for expectation .	70.2232792157955
I will try again .	281.22141995843344
He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire .	97.41645178303791
If I wished to think slightingly of any body's children , it should not be of my own however .	29.800774201350286
There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings !	43.46770312514651
His choice is disinterested at least , for he must know my father can give her nothing .	25.9265372884171
This is an evening of wonders , indeed !	74.01285395591567
1 .	4079.0161042043856
If he had been wavering before , as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy , as dignity unblemished could make him .	10.543609422019252
it was not their wish to force her communication .	53.626493198957725
You wish to think all the world respectable , and are hurt if I speak ill of any body .	32.09172379424489
F2 .	6847.919774710029
He was received by Bennet with a degree of civility , which made her two daughters ashamed , especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend .	9.719965082377906
That is the place to get husbands .	133.01830191225343
Sir , you quite misunderstand me , said Bennet , alarmed .	70.48299218100948
engaged to Darcy !	1056.6896126489655
How far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs , I cannot tell ;	23.94537917490876
and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown .	57.844026092343896
only think !	1979.8952713446542
But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley .	17.065535804762202
and then you may say whatever you like of me .	42.94951252229694
Gardiner was standing a little behind ;	134.22305751073608
His behaviour to her sister was such , during dinner time , as shewed an admiration of her , which , though more guarded than formerly , persuaded Elizabeth , that if left wholly to himself , Jane's happiness , and his own , would be speedily secured .	10.015215427266488
He paused in hopes of an answer ;	105.80048064758579
but I hope this may be false .	120.53615833922282
But I think Darcy improves on acquaintance .	81.88896027129354
Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , reflecting on what she had heard , and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it , when Sir William Lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family .	8.849198974637634
It is a rule with me , that a person who can write a long letter , with ease , cannot write ill .	15.43856202614224
I know little of the game , at present , said he , but I shall be glad to improve myself , for in my situation of life Philips was very thankful for his compliance , but could not wait for his reason .	13.223219823847074
For such an attachment as this , she might have sufficient charms ;	42.130080273520896
On the strength of Darcy's regard Bingley had the firmest reliance , and of his judgment the highest opinion .	20.05882878405363
With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Bingley and talked of Darcy may be guessed .	21.349038285495777
He walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind ;	19.248958537046875
I am not going to run away , Papa , said Kitty , fretfully ;	31.36108615511015
Her not objecting , does not justify him .	59.38031900132067
I am sorry to pain you but so it was .	45.493154702360506
Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in undiminished beauty ;	66.57940380103827
for Lady Catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men .	8.551065505482267
She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place , and accordingly began by observing , that his arrival had been very unexpected for your housekeeper , she added , informed us that you would certainly not be here till to-morrow ;	10.428537979584183
Oh !	3082.833849588038
there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded , and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time .	17.45630385287752
He looked surprised , displeased , alarmed ;	79.6288508749835
In a moment they were all out of the chaise , rejoicing at the sight of each other .	25.281935489794794
I wish this may be more intelligible , but though not confined for time , my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent .	14.189070591837007
and on the part of Bennet and Kitty , though she was perfectly unknown to them , even inferior to what Elizabeth felt .	22.686298913477547
Eager to be alone , and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt , she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley , and then hurried away to dress .	10.974181139208952
His countenance , voice , and manner , had established him at once in the possession of every virtue .	31.39677481576263
He assured her that as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ;	40.26229786777095
Already arisen !	1571.4439182596846
an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope , that by the following Christmas , she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day , unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war-office , another regiment should be quartered in Meryton .	7.472601299008557
Ah !	5682.7059499578245
On the evening before my going to London , said he I made a confession to him , which I believe I ought to have made long ago .	14.475298921185912
As they passed into other rooms , these objects were taking different positions ;	16.531991314305323
The path just admitted three .	135.21277768141067
her's lasted a little longer ;	210.68243742222396
Do not let us quarrel about the past .	79.51229709746303
He was a tall , heavy looking young man of five and twenty .	26.094725779090034
Elizabeth was not comfortable ;	420.12037168930874
But I dare not hope it .	153.85601857179057
The strangeness of Collins's making two offers of marriage within three days , was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted .	12.409592632983612
and if you are not kind to us , brother , I do not know what we shall do .	27.208268101396886
Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports , by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under .	9.610071132872212
but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship , I suspect his gratitude misleads him , and that in spite of her being his patroness , she is an arrogant , conceited woman .	11.098106177965429
But it is of small importance .	138.18808453831667
Your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct , I am sure .	26.666750439722758
I [ Illustration : A VICARAGE HOUSE .	69.43748916528618

Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself ;	11.732907584850619
I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one .	51.95861489572116
By all that I have ever read , I am convinced that it is very common indeed , that human nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other , real or imaginary .	8.006670125513908
At night she opened her heart to Jane .	60.35307109886491
That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Bingley and Jane , she had never doubted ;	25.358849440309054
Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner ;	45.121065520434634
I roused , and interested you , because I was so unlike them .	49.03332629511661
Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty .	19.683784024541723
and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared with his friend .	11.078751333898342
Put them next to your great uncle the judge .	44.13290970777655
She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done , and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct .	16.725231149816473
And which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty ?	27.127633095913573
My dear Lizzy , you cannot think me so weak , as to be in danger now .	25.78889325400919
She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself , in their first evening at Philips's .	19.607217251659645
I wish it may .	309.1141247159484
She approached , and saw the likeness of Wickham suspended , amongst several other miniatures , over the mantle-piece .	13.522823306692302
but on beholding it , ( for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library , ) he started back , and begging pardon , protested that he never read novels .	11.398935168427428
When she thought of her mother indeed , her confidence gave way a little , but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with Darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend's connections , than from their want of sense ;	9.386316154779204
The very last evening was spent there ;	71.38023719473344
and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to .	12.66028077340821
CHAPTER XX .	1575.3856872474946
Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand .	93.87778923994236
The children have been wanting me this half hour .	49.93267848274173
To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed , she soon afterwards said , I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal .	7.216274919348492
DEAR SIR , I must trouble you once more for congratulations .	36.87591619199227
After breakfast , the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Wickham were returned , and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball .	14.864829537842201
By Hurst and Miss Bingley , they were noticed only by a curtsey ;	35.31258188680027
and she was quite decided at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining Bingley for his sister .	11.672305465843131
She could have added , A young man too , like you , whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable but she contented herself with And one , too , who had probably been his own companion from childhood , connected together , as I think you said , in the closest manner !	7.715976528908489
the ladies had crowded round the table , where Miss Bennet was making tea , and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee , in so close a confederacy , that there was not a single vacancy near her , which would admit of a chair .	10.166825827712344
She is a most charming young lady indeed .	74.43575203397516
This matter may be considered , therefore , as finally settled .	47.92533807888772
Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go , merely on that account , for in general you know they visit no new comers .	11.916840148580476
I never saw any one so shocked .	88.22673406783585
and if I were determined to get a rich husband , or any husband , I dare say I should adopt it .	17.483054715918747
I cannot find out that I hate her at all , or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl .	18.967744869423672
but Collins , much offended , laid aside his book , and said , I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp , though written solely for their benefit .	7.851739571430748
but her letters were always long expected , and always very short .	41.447563731515885
but their progress was slow , for Gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little .	10.201741527311723
has thrown herself into the power of of Wickham .	56.83828094441346
To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever .	26.133517396279046
Elizabeth had settled it that Darcy would bring his sister to visit her , the very day after her reaching Pemberley ;	19.01982888721825
He is also handsome , replied Elizabeth , which a young man ought likewise to be , if he possibly can .	21.819886353066227
and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects , which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world .	26.553120728334605
and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford , they reached Gardiner's house , where they were to remain a few days .	19.053342776301534
whether he had been aware of Jane's attachment , or whether it had escaped his observation ;	26.717450615644907
I suspected as much , replied Elizabeth .	119.68935302896972
and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there , to know the rest .	35.49146981974115
He has made me so happy , said she , one evening , by telling me , that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring !	15.583029850454642
Collins was gratified ;	616.7622258465419
She has one only daughter , the heiress of Rosings , and of very extensive property .	24.966620539656027
Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips .	14.786579986701636
and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter .	28.12586751708031
Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon .	37.82527621848609
Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty ;	62.47952786116233
but , however , do not speak to Darcy about it , if you had rather not .	32.40698667121009
Gardiner , whose manners were easy and pleasant , encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks ;	14.939415538716704
She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire ;	21.598295229981815
When they parted , Lady Catherine , with great condescension , wished them a good journey , and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year ;	13.647049224508834
said he , as he joined her .	132.75072595562935
I wonder that the very pride of this Darcy has not made him just to you !	32.925029460323394
E1 through 1 .	508.66837115231795
for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing .	29.040387514817354
I will not trust myself on the subject , replied Wickham , I can hardly be just to him .	25.064084423684367
Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendance , and when immediately before my father's death , Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me , I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him , as of affection to myself .	8.350702777793238
and Elizabeth sorry for her , and sorry for her father's speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no good .	21.830155605711216
CHAPTER XII .	1403.50908934543
Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham ;	28.624596560127934
It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family .	30.058868726483833
Occupied in observing Bingley's attentions to her sister , Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend .	13.067681310682186
but his friend Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine , tall person , handsome features , noble mien ;	12.186676761138786
To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit <URL> While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements , we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate .	3.5060015271223937
Hurst sang with her sister , and while they were thus employed Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument , how frequently Darcy's eyes were fixed on her .	9.076861194479074
Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him , I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds , or any thing like it , has been advanced .	12.9212287290484
After welcoming their sisters , they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords , exclaiming , Is not this nice ?	7.121317998174423
To these high flown expressions , Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ;	22.943673574704906
the satisfaction of Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face , as made her look handsomer than ever .	13.566269387827507
come into my room .	273.100086926848
It is difficult indeed it is distressing .	89.31876154995241
And so , you like this man's sisters too , do you ?	38.094789961176616
and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern , when Kitty left them , she went boldly on with him alone .	15.916570892173004
Collins on his return highly gratified Bennet by admiring Philips's manners and politeness .	18.22089436265726
I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine , that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess , and that the most elevated rank , instead of giving her consequence , would be adorned by her .	10.847871782318576
So imprudent a match on both sides !	71.91570236664205
If I can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too .	20.345291382383436
But , Lizzy !	659.573351423035
Seriously , I would have you be on your guard .	85.34225076416524
And do you impute it to either of those ?	73.09264722687658
but as she reached the door , it was opened by a servant , and Darcy appeared .	34.96787075499931
She complained bitterly of all this to her husband .	82.80567425000967
You are very cruel , said her sister , you will not let me smile , and are provoking me to it every moment .	20.771345438926048
I have already told her so once , by your desire .	44.308961842380356
Though I know it must be a scandalous falsehood ;	72.4332407936201
Not at all .	568.6459700566107
all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return .	29.889356596827902
My dear Charles , what do you mean ?	71.1777906951564
Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained ;	26.072534960016476
Heaven and earth !	549.1421248858585

The Miss Webbs all play , and their father has not so good an income as your's .	20.075341022777458
for while he was present , Jane had no attention to bestow on any one else ;	30.45845733553495
Come , Kitty , I want you up stairs .	76.58012250762998
I must confess myself surprised by your application ;	65.12824197942778
On opening the door , she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth , as if engaged in earnest conversation ;	14.361434519151253
He was the proudest , most disagreeable man in the world , and every body hoped that he would never come there again .	19.729146953970194
I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be .	36.850668032689796
I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours , he coldly replied .	25.227140906677832
Yes , indeed ;	686.8779297677748
Astonishment , apprehension , and even horror , oppressed her .	44.256925940562624
and her Ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey , gave them directions as to the best method of packing , and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way , that Maria thought herself obliged , on her return , to undo all the work of the morning , and pack her trunk afresh .	8.333026618341876
As for Wickham and Lydia , their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters .	23.063842180453946
I quite detest the man .	171.368947782818
She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Darcy that Darcy might leave the country , but that he should stand his ground ;	12.174714618310967
You have a house in town , I conclude ?	88.18982284632065
Of the lady's sensations they remained a little in doubt ;	34.144875552885736
My avowed one , or what I avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which I have since made .	13.906900285492572
She saw with the creative eye of fancy , the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers .	14.296768538128575
The distance is nothing , when one has a motive ;	51.82651406696463
To know that her daughter would be married was enough .	75.89790767255249
And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing , that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood , before she was banished to the North .	15.559862581824314
You mentioned two instances .	272.32471982299086
I take up my pen again to do , what I have just told you I would not , but circumstances are such , that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here , as soon as possible .	10.70455425985651
No I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did .	30.710361556137542
Darcy said very little , and Hurst nothing at all .	60.18299212927732
and already had Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping , when an answer arrived which deferred it all .	11.34977464022252
It could not be for society , as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips ;	16.88151640438968
All this she must possess , added Darcy , and to all this she must yet add something more substantial , in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading .	13.049457215091884
It is settled between us already , that we are to be the happiest couple in the world .	24.01200706087779
But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede .	38.95222915128888
You mistake me , my dear .	165.70004712251574
And will you promise me , never to enter into such an engagement ?	31.51093891501882
The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases , and again during the chief of the day , was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Collins .	17.39641260846267
You began the evening well , Charlotte , said Bennet with civil self-command to Miss Lucas .	30.64317620565981
Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in July , and must be in London again within a month ;	12.181733751719966
Hurst thought the same , and added , She has nothing , in short , to recommend her , but being an excellent walker .	24.002221645955153
and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks .	17.21472033410957
but she was satisfied with none .	143.52090232283766
Indeed , you are mistaken , I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here .	24.382965972526524
I thought we never should have got into the coach .	53.97377824921823
She wished , she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them ;	36.81714193307074
Oh !	3082.833849588038
for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to Darcy were by no means over .	21.882674792342346
and I know I appeared distressed .	131.8117029253971
But you do not know all .	161.76549956389817
He absolutely started , and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise ;	33.754622000522886
It does seem , and it is most shocking indeed , replied Elizabeth , with tears in her eyes , that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt .	10.528221744950695
She went on .	714.1945019182048
Nay , cried Bingley , this is too much , to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning .	19.63301265887898
How thankful am I , that we never let them know what has been said against him ;	25.268168110676964
She had also to anticipate how her visit would pass , the quiet tenor of their usual employments , the vexatious interruptions of Collins , and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings .	8.022681566477893
During their walk , it was resolved that Bennet's consent should be asked in the course of the evening .	22.841305732680784
She says Lizzy had better have taken Collins ;	54.968225344410264
This information made Elizabeth smile , as she thought of poor Miss Bingley .	34.07418572750043
but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown , before they are packed up .	12.58445624133939
No sooner did he appear , than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed ;	19.051667259275547
I can safely say , that every advance to intimacy began on her side .	28.103990508228613
It was really a very handsome thought .	100.45302179460502
perhaps that was the reason of his silence ;	110.99178616231282
You know him too well to doubt the rest .	58.8001600027697
That is an uncommon advantage , and uncommon I hope it will continue , for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance .	16.422404082798238
but where other powers of entertainment are wanting , the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given .	9.901571551110806
Miss Bennet's lovely face confirmed his views , and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority ;	14.196769721851084
But no such recollection befriended her .	98.23854669636806
In this danger Kitty is also comprehended .	68.5339447153181
and then rising up , said to Elizabeth , Miss Bennet , there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn .	19.668197972096046
Is not general incivility the very essence of love ?	45.8149935111197
nonsense , how can you talk so !	96.45059271311887
We have dined nine times at Rosings , besides drinking tea there twice !	18.008943549225133
cried he , with more feeling than politeness ;	76.40619738874375
His behaviour to myself has been scandalous ;	113.31466307193327
and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire-place , that she might be farther from the door .	21.316288036188077
but his companion was not disposed to make any ;	78.35667205924842
and , at last , on the young lady's whispering to Elizabeth again , he walked away .	35.83508949785742
Allowing the case , however , to stand according to your representation , you must remember , Miss Bennet , that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house , and the delay of his plan , has merely desired it , asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety .	7.848057221662305
I feel as if I had never done you justice , or loved you as you deserve .	26.980922734022528
Their fortune on both sides is splendid .	62.984950321597374
I remain , dear sir , with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters , your well-wisher and friend , WILLIAM COLLINS .	12.978217115113816
She then ran gaily off , rejoicing as she rambled about , in the hope of being at home again in a day or two .	15.681591954529924
In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ?	25.648973719251583
susceptibility to her feelings ;	663.0015730074566
Not all that Bennet , however , with the assistance of her five daughters , could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Bingley .	14.1799329609474
It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it .	26.514058742065703
I have not been used to submit to any person's whims .	37.37227819061504
Oh !	3082.833849588038
And what sort of table do they keep ?	53.21012250766033
but this was declined , and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness .	26.39457893697146
It will pass away soon enough .	105.88402590636832
There is nothing like dancing after all .	70.08733513837811
The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to Wickham's charge , exceedingly shocked her ;	11.33789222465746
and all was soon right again .	141.00985730823294
but I dare say he may spend half his time here ;	30.341522305352253
therefore , stay quietly at Longbourn , and depend on my diligence and care .	33.92913190857955
so tall !	1588.491336192813
In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity ;	33.54712480911307
or allow her to hear it from any one but myself .	55.47130084086264
and when at length they turned in at the lodge , her spirits were in a high flutter .	20.39504153934161
First of all , he asked Miss Lucas .	127.78366673445107
She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height , or rather taller .	29.130746772037703
Elizabeth soon heard from her friend ;	174.20478615735215
None at all .	658.6952038436597
Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again .	39.723345608232904
They must all go to Brighton .	119.49457892122614
he had felt their importance in the family circle .	85.7849503453419
It may perhaps be pleasant , replied Charlotte , to be able to impose on the public in such a case ;	20.518803817776185
and in the latter object , where she feared most to fail , she was most sure of success , for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour .	10.989199475199051
The moment of her release from him was ecstacy .	63.11786713006627
Nay , said Elizabeth , this is not fair .	82.45499879557441
They left Brighton together on Sunday night , and were traced almost to London , but not beyond ;	19.221152577549372
I have not a doubt of your doing very well together .	46.798767711583245
What do you mean , Hill ?	111.05570111688756
and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away .	10.518507402272988
Nothing of the past was recollected with pain ;	69.82970753633131
it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life .	47.87301838614335
She had dressed with more than usual care , and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart , trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening .	10.74938023469595
and besides , it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body , and had so many favourites .	16.44625969862061
Unfortunately an only son , ( for many years an only child ) I was spoilt by my parents , who though good themselves , ( my father particularly , all that was benevolent and amiable , ) allowed , encouraged , almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing , to care for none beyond my own family circle , to think meanly of all the rest of the world , to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own .	5.78084510643864
You are not going to be Missish , I hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report .	24.29617704313081
Aye that is because you have the right disposition .	74.71247153511395
she longed to hear more , and was grateful to her uncle for saying , There are very few people of whom so much can be said .	15.72873412186036
Whatever I do is done in a hurry , replied he ;	50.06561277138093
No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there .	16.588424560154852
When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose , or procuring any thing you had a fancy for ?	12.419387219403154
And what did she say ?	199.80370665662775
I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long .	14.43327113179083
Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact ;	46.28162353017052
Indeed I have , Sir , was her answer .	100.71948706057766
I was afraid they might not ;	152.0861640148607
Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure , but as his brother was eager in it , he meant to assist him in pursuing it .	13.1511351810746
But her commendation , though costing her some trouble , could by no means satisfy Collins , and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship's praise into his own hands .	10.749654509646398
it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister's being in town .	14.891052514530816
but the grounds are delightful .	150.4725625336436
There are few people in England , I suppose , who have more true enjoyment of music than myself , or a better natural taste .	13.317445651225823
cried Maria , after a few minutes silence , it seems but a day or two since we first came !	16.197961836654166
I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression .	25.19194282020923
Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great Lady's attention , which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others .	12.757181315624667
Sometimes she could fancy , that he talked less than on former occasions , and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her , he was trying to trace a resemblance .	11.766234577767287
As much as I ever wish to be , cried Elizabeth warmly , I have spent four days in the same house with him , and I think him very disagreeable .	17.114623612225852
Far be it from me , he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure , to resent the behaviour of your daughter .	14.466765192762272
Nothing could be more delightful !	237.09376549574557
But if otherwise , if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been exchanged , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method , in her partiality for Wickham , and that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment .	5.426253342035887
My poor mother is really ill and keeps her room .	31.618515333446943
But of this answer Lydia heard not a word .	57.351430850097245
What a delightful library you have at Pemberley , Darcy !	51.92687085763907
Oh , sister !	679.4589065201496
Of music !	1585.9516482468323
His attachment to Rosings , certainly increases .	94.19301297177806
It was very little less .	241.0498396286615
She would not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried home ;	29.694325101963656
And Lydia used to want to go to London , added Kitty .	41.61530974292116
I have a high respect for your nerves .	78.40700197216252
he certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible ;	42.009514768701884
it seems but a fortnight I declare ;	105.99961577206848
and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body .	25.025992430142477
He then handed her in , Maria followed , and the door was on the point of being closed , when he suddenly reminded them , with some consternation , that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings .	10.07720499651882
and as to Miss Bennet , he could not conceive an angel more beautiful .	40.0141852329562
As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Bingley , and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to , made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane .	8.149099289716506
and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence .	19.848835083625467
Its effect was most extraordinary ;	201.6743729566433
it was to remain the whole winter , and Meryton was the head quarters .	48.52193961002735
How strange !	1574.7224801360626
CHAPTER IX .	1311.7971600904
Her hair so untidy , so blowsy !	76.18536627562712
Good bye .	1418.4086473461753
And what is your success ?	207.43382398180918
His character was to speak for itself .	127.92798101539782
they were brightened by the exercise .	207.10735635399197
In the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more ;	35.20481862828244
Why should he have it more than anybody else ?	57.04418242929751

We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes , on purpose to pass for a lady , only think what fun !	13.791833865007607
Has he , has my nephew , made you an offer of marriage ?	32.594030233739346
cried Bennet , shaking her head , then she is better off than many girls .	23.007100733721355
Had his character been known , this could not have happened .	49.13228107096694
At that moment , she cared for no other .	86.47680055902656
where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making , and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself , some shelves in the closets up stairs .	12.597707070319128
Her Ladyship , with great condescension , arose to receive them ;	41.453309324246746
I am sure Lizzy will be very happy I am sure she can have no objection .	24.700913430456506
for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds .	35.26909932810828
Amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment ;	14.859173611911071
but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general , since Jane united with great strength of feeling , a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner , which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent .	8.696977244760198
how ardently did she long to know , whether any of his were directed in a like manner .	24.727695114444327

but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine .	21.05776661757065
And do you really know all this ?	101.51846556727406
If from no better motive , that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest , for dishonesty I must call it .	16.54867173550914
And yet , upon my honour , I believed what I said of myself to be true , and I believe it at this moment .	20.562978301666615
I did not think Gardiner was so little to be trusted .	60.28901460199651
His brother-in-law , Hurst , merely looked the gentleman ;	47.39721452427833
It was hardly enough ;	253.1364006838664
and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did not err .	32.99296288371217
It was spoken of again while they were at dinner , when Collins joining in , observed , Yes , Miss Elizabeth , you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church , and I need not say you will be delighted with her .	9.299579193256353
if one could but go to Brighton !	81.85214671084272
It was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ;	12.379318802305047
Their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like man he is a great friend of Darcy's .	35.21873050075747
After sitting for a moment in silence , she said very stiffly to Elizabeth , I hope you are well , Miss Bennet .	20.554315993362422
But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Gardiner's letter , or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him .	9.391640701555895
You cannot refuse to dance , I am sure , when so much beauty is before you .	24.76396168774197
Well , how pleased I am !	185.78954926253942
But don't imagine it was from any silly cause .	56.029305125607806
I hope not so .	390.55661194363836
Your plan is a good one , replied Elizabeth , where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married ;	19.95124424545755
I often tell young ladies , that no excellence in music is to be acquired , without constant practice .	17.436373489039195
are sufficiently known .	549.1421248858585
She saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow ;	15.138176966286155
To Elizabeth , however , he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed .	28.321954397765946
In that case he would return no more .	64.6513761237681
She dared not even mention that gentleman .	78.7740680351175
But , on second thoughts , perhaps Lizzy could tell us , what relations he has now living , better than any other person .	13.030416240279996
No one but Jane , she thought , could flatter herself with such an expectation .	37.075173305522966
The girls stared at their father .	140.89777501131047
The person of whom I speak , is a gentleman and a stranger .	41.47574926748723
Whatever my connections may be , said Elizabeth , if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to you .	20.92725708936943
He smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said .	34.33571425435974
CHAPTER XIV .	1311.7971600904
My mother would have had no objection , but my father hates London .	44.05237851574046
[ Illustration : MATLOCK ] PRIDE AND PREJUDICE : A Novel .	21.74574778877382
Kitty then owned , with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us , that in Lydia's last letter , she had prepared her for such a step .	13.607312131508523
Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could ;	89.0854155474515
Little more than half a day's journey .	96.1668050700093
and so it does I vow .	131.37854872494037
and therefore it will not signify to anybody here , what he really is .	32.55888058414892
and by that means , as I told Lady Catherine myself one day , has deprived the British court of its brightest ornament .	14.192229211943609
Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane , on their first arrival at Lambton ;	16.661500869402253
You may imagine what I felt and how I acted .	56.76728460353474
It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner .	25.178456690942905
He deserves to be publicly disgraced .	160.91153947409913
Of having another daughter married to Collins , she thought with equal certainty , and with considerable , though not equal , pleasure .	15.743693381266047
and it was settled , that as soon as the ceremony was over , they should proceed to Longbourn .	25.359008706905755
Bennet was quite in the fidgets .	206.7948170436761
The first part of Gardiner's business on her arrival , was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions .	13.243593142373372

Bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say , but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , I shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as I did before .	9.752506448012712
It seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence , a most country town indifference to decorum .	14.310812973042479
The idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ;	8.913114609456171
I know my dear uncle and aunt so well , that I am not afraid of requesting it , though I have still something more to ask of the former .	18.638334844016853
would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe .	53.69080544657075
They look upon it quite as their own , I dare say , whenever that happens .	24.019561565986695
The subject was pursued no farther , and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away .	29.635081987093848
Reynolds informed them , that it had been taken in his father's life time .	37.435748856441556
Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets , of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won , and Collins , in describing the civility of and Philips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist , enumerating all the dishes at supper , and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House .	6.770910193896045
His principal object must be , to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham .	18.687508159039364
But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter , depended on the will of the parents .	20.59341797925828
or that may comfort you , under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parent's mind .	16.580262924811578
But I am particularly attached to these young men ;	58.21007857707579
He inquired how far Netherfield was from Meryton ;	50.6563333405039
Her father lifted up his eyes .	118.09157879815962
That you were gone into the army , and she was afraid had not turned out well .	26.655458079788406
Having said thus much , I feel no doubt of your secrecy .	41.68368720488265
Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look ;	30.088539601126527
that , that is the worst of all .	181.77623834976325
and that friendship between a person capable of it , and such an amiable man as Bingley , was incomprehensible .	24.06642140202189
and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley , in spite of that pollution which its woods had received , not merely from the presence of such a mistress , but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city .	9.863592648199996
Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished .	108.44412639025754
and very lively hopes of Bingley's heart were entertained .	48.105275372133285
He takes them now for people of fashion .	51.677246817256126
She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry ;	14.547925237876406
how can you be so teazing ?	154.5602042785879
and be ready to believe , for every body's sake , that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin .	16.060006053634655
in every view it is unaccountable !	190.17279731326687
Jane looked a little paler than usual , but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected .	24.793371339365148
said he , taking the letter from his pocket ;	69.46380117042297
La !	5497.109814759492
he hardly ever mentioned your name .	108.16406024762483
Nay , were your friend Lady Catherine to know me , I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation .	16.606066811991386
Wickham did not play at whist , and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia .	15.718085984457622
I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made her here ;	23.538319563771417
Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for common use ;	16.255715036190907
I am not a great reader , and I have pleasure in many things .	44.01477018302381
I cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen , in the whole range of my acquaintance , that are really accomplished .	17.352256841644138

Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was .	93.30127366587018
A long dispute followed this declaration ;	88.82498377992901
Undoubtedly , replied Darcy , to whom this remark was chiefly addressed , there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation .	8.963267166818166
My affections and wishes are unchanged , but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever .	14.57545381383201
What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ?	27.490543524002298
There was novelty in the scheme , and as , with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters , home could not be faultless , a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake .	12.191103970096588
She then spoke of the letter , repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham .	19.057126906332968
They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them .	29.096504554578523
They had often attempted it before , but it was a subject on which Bennet was beyond the reach of reason ;	17.63230522599109
It is nothing in comparison of Rosings , my lady , I dare say ;	39.513781084354086

Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters , would be unpardonable in me .	25.769331087068203
One morning , soon after their arrival , as she was sitting with her two elder sisters , she said to Elizabeth , Lizzy , I never gave you an account of my wedding , I believe .	14.34153339674421
This is your final resolve !	181.93977672215368
I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good .	43.54089731290738
It will not do .	487.7414472217024
You either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other's confidence and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking ;	6.5341172263506495
I quite forgot !	549.2432047498212
Charlotte herself was tolerably composed .	147.60731798863395
Elizabeth was surprised , but agreed to it immediately .	76.79379478057898
and hastily seizing a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt , if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended .	9.109445265693218
Colonel Forster will , I dare say , do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head .	21.538600990007062
You are safe from me .	174.55965188437858
Here , Sarah , come to Miss Bennet this moment , and help her on with her gown .	26.351638631257522
but from every window there were beauties to be seen .	44.28068138131783
This Younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with Wickham ;	48.901365652954894
You have insulted me , in every possible method .	76.86001902219391
from thence to the library ;	267.38008291987046
to be only just tolerable .	308.50603665965997
But papa is so disagreeable .	196.04692004636996
Why must she be scampering about the country , because her sister had a cold ?	29.859046598051865
I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday .	46.9218054813484
Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley .	21.03916118667077
The vicious propensities the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which Darcy could not have .	8.57974530891507
Jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention .	20.525305403615437
Darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish , and who probably never looked at you in his life !	16.654669159257313
The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield .	42.75070727646239
Oh !	3082.833849588038
talents which rightly used , might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters , even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife .	10.45540262900792
She turned from sister to sister , demanding their congratulations , and when at length they all sat down , looked eagerly round the room , took notice of some little alteration in it , and observed , with a laugh , that it was a great while since she had been there .	8.23395378372371
Wickham's happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer , and Collins's proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could .	13.409434827722851
A great deal of good management , depend upon it .	41.544744171265776
You have done all this !	259.65912727969487
The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life , and where they were now to spend a few days , was probably as great an object of her curiosity , as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock , Chatsworth , Dovedale , or the Peak .	8.743018645654377
but depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our surest way of disappointing him , will be to ask nothing about it .	16.011751993701456
It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment , from which she had been so wholly free at first .	13.995609798406456
Gardiner had seen Pemberley , and known the late Darcy by character perfectly well .	29.83317180814143
What could be the meaning of it ?	124.27251610126318
But to be candid without ostentation or design to take the good of every body's character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad belongs to you alone .	11.691320895036922
and her residence there will probably be of some duration .	51.87692365799551
But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice .	29.202909505613704
They are generally long ;	274.6385190689009
Exceed their income !	669.4117483347201
Find such a woman as soon as you can , bring her to Hunsford , and I will visit her .	25.404688148169797
Elizabeth jumped out ;	549.4825709014335
But these are not Jane's feelings ;	129.0732206897966
Elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her .	27.981556032358657
You think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly .	90.84657916693273
But you have chosen your fault well .	80.67871602426399
All loveliness and goodness as she is !	103.26585809113939
and , to my certain knowledge , more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner .	20.2706087192817
His air was grave and stately , and his manners were very formal .	31.739761524401313
As they drove to Gardiner's door , Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival ;	18.589169776359995
Oh !	3082.833849588038
But , she continued , recollecting herself , as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him .	20.69860949114804
My mother is tolerably well , I trust ;	100.58893255670876
At such a time , much might have been said , and silence was very awkward .	43.628439065223276
and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend , met her with every appearance of composure .	25.738883720229495
as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education , and who still resides with them .	23.827608368654726
But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend , where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment , should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire , without waiting to be argued into it ?	8.108568189482618
and every dish was commended , first by him , and then by Sir William , who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said , in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear .	7.88867827525595
he had lost every point ;	227.1688081274187
The housekeeper came forward , and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman , the son of her late master's steward , who had been brought up by him at his own expence .	13.804410778626044
She accounted for it , however , by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn , had by some accident been lost .	18.88605002227404
Sometimes .	6847.919774710029
for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all .	20.40923453545735
Their reception from Bennet , to whom they then turned , was not quite so cordial .	26.02440046393391
Why , I must confess , that I love him better than I do Bingley .	41.815418451260705
Aye , there she comes , continued Bennet , looking as unconcerned as may be , and caring no more for us than if we were at York , provided she can have her own way .	9.754378229026099
it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate .	34.56945177651648
He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names .	25.4571551275497
Elizabeth saw what he was doing , and at the first convenient pause , turned to him with an arch smile , and said , You mean to frighten me , Darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me ?	12.395483338185473
And when the party entered the assembly room , it consisted of only five altogether ;	29.020060718424922
It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy .	55.44966458955398
Yes but as it happens , they are all of them very clever .	41.68817173081589
When Collins could be forgotten , there was really a great air of comfort throughout , and by Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it , Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten .	12.283670559845092
Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ;	65.91718446878399
perhaps she meant well , but , under such a misfortune as this , one cannot see too little of one's neighbours .	18.494755620539767
It is evident that you belong to the first circles .	70.45902546001298
This was one point , with regard to Lydia at least , which was now to be settled , and Bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him .	16.203847252398372
and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room .	42.284314748093344
She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter , and , without knowing or considering what their income might be , rejected many as deficient in size and importance .	9.158668778940982
CHAPTER VI .	1311.7971600904
but I verily believe I could forgive him any thing and every thing , rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father .	10.618869138968755
Oh !	3082.833849588038
Her astonishment at his coming at his coming to Netherfield , to Longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire .	11.944403189115853
The promised letter of thanks from Collins arrived on Tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted .	9.242498875523342
Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of , cried Colonel Fitzwilliam .	29.824834845818778
I deserve neither such praise nor such censure , cried Elizabeth ;	24.615772744852563
She had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire Militia , in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man , who , on meeting him accidentally in town , had there renewed a slight acquaintance .	11.370792608002027
I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these .	23.587459342520287
No , said her father , Wickham's a fool , if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds .	14.885952200194994
and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane , nor half so good humoured as Lydia .	21.375112645186718
Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter ;	32.00762216704603
it jumps from admiration to love , from love to matrimony in a moment .	26.577379169727408
As soon as I get to town , I shall go to my brother , and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street , and then we may consult together as to what is to be done .	13.50773722823175
and then , on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured , he replied , Say nothing of that .	15.163830528985669
Certainly not .	1611.0385365282914
Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home .	62.3104867135448
and that being the case , I cannot consider your situation with much compassion .	31.076153085726187
He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her .	26.485645938018422
the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy , received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before ;	11.279030736089013
As she had heard no carriage , she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine , and under that apprehension was putting away her half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions , when the door opened , and to her very great surprise , Darcy , and Darcy only , entered the room .	8.705256261693156
That tall , proud man .	153.89028579955436
In the hall they parted .	221.63592332026434
They were hopeless of remedy .	146.64252609767837
After an affectionate parting between the friends , Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Collins , and as they walked down the garden , he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family , not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter , and his compliments to and Gardiner , though unknown .	10.423734303523617
but , recovering herself , said in a lively tone , And pray , what is the usual price of an Earl's younger son ?	16.58076900021939
His most particular friend , you see by Jane's account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her .	20.599423525873384
She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue , and the mere stateliness of money and rank , she thought she could witness without trepidation .	8.673637307812426
You must not disappoint your father .	118.10665477292119
Good girl !	1636.7801354523199
Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection , and said something of his concern , at having been prevented by business .	18.500363246869707
You may have drawn him in .	146.09703605040227
He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying ;	38.96920792063627
But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes .	17.820504777769937
If you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence .	34.64454239405463
E3 .	6847.919774710029
I , who have prided myself on my discernment !	64.85524541808246
I beg your pardon , replied Miss Bingley , turning away with a sneer .	32.96449590178648
I am sincerely grieved for him and F but no one can throw any blame on them .	14.632873885211058
But I pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it .	16.955883848155334
He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which it seems he has been told , by some of the good-natured , gossiping Lucases .	12.476480800197779
Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly , as well as her affection for Jane ;	20.473281824378116
I am glad he dines here on Tuesday .	55.13444218255333
Each felt for the other , and of course for themselves ;	71.65032797785044
She saw herself the object of attention , to tens and to scores of them at present unknown .	23.948293441182106
on the contrary , he was all attention to every body .	70.63212446390779
and , having nothing else to say , was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him .	20.08493626059282
but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts ;	46.32281704637862
I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge .	27.933024688309427
you do not know what I suffer .	133.81440278338513
I can now say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , I have seen nothing of it .	16.820563957218965
Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education .	40.82750958131665
shocking !	6847.919774710029
She is a great fool for going away , if she liked him .	35.12944397116828
I am so pleased so happy .	104.9997489835959
Oh !	3082.833849588038
but whatever she said , was spoken in so authoritative a tone , as marked her self-importance , and brought Wickham immediately to Elizabeth's mind ;	14.92632850462724
All was joy and kindness .	155.92019088946594
I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable .	36.18360505891597
and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning .	14.131085914362817
You tear them to pieces .	213.90881943966556
she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him .	23.822087470168757
but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's .	33.36694767566535
but his sisters gave it their hearty assent , and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations .	10.501325989834536
It will be no use to us , if twenty such should come since you will not visit them .	18.071054031272112
but when Philips began to express her concern thereupon , he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance , that he considered the money as a mere trifle , and begged she would not make herself uneasy .	9.935548809192154
She seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute , and never attended to Mary at all .	17.181553424021686
but with him I believe it does not often happen .	70.29603201055833
In spite of what her sister declared , and really believed to be her feelings , in the expectation of his arrival , Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it .	17.140114088764168
but they obligingly satisfied it , with the same kind of supposition , which had appeased Bennet's curiosity ;	23.55063725709544
The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value !	21.203514148815376
but their astonishment was beyond their expectation ;	84.21050501725041
Not Lydia only , but all were concerned in it ;	58.317711084508794
They are all for what they can get .	91.12213464224001
and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared .	17.894512070722207
Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony , marriage had always been her object ;	16.393204026082735
And of this place , thought she , I might have been mistress !	52.609063146274984
Well , Monday morning came , and I was in such a fuss !	42.22104957731624
and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again .	25.63087815684152
1 .	4079.0161042043856
I confess , said he , that I should not have been at all surprised by her Ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings .	12.440887785541817
determined , if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive , and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female .	7.587215387687641
and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ;	16.041735423653716
In society so superior to what she had generally known , her improvement was great .	26.227764734653093
was fonder than ever of Georgiana , almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore , and paid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth .	10.475482283477978
gone to stay .	973.4373398525687
What will you think of my vanity ?	155.86781368960234
I thought I should have broke my heart .	76.00222630130229
Oh , Lizzy !	706.061916680351
and therefore checked her laugh .	149.80147884865283
She had never perceived , while the regiment was in Hertfordshire , that Lydia had any partiality for him , but she was convinced that Lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body .	11.93686410757215
Oh , yes !	522.7852403671635
We must not make him desperate .	158.97258874464373
and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour , that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford , she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Darcy's having both spent three weeks at Rosings , and asked him if he were acquainted with the former .	7.620835554480775
His father , Miss Bennet , the late Darcy , was one of the best men that ever breathed , and the truest friend I ever had ;	18.73792016738957
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come .	5.1923232740744565
It was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too , and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it .	18.260152732502835
They were off Saturday night about twelve , as is conjectured , but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight .	12.820644546922768
What is it you are talking of ?	106.59231180504035
We all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ;	36.4448945114316
His belief of her sister's insensibility , she instantly resolved to be false , and his account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice .	14.478860364713835
and pray when am I to wish you joy ?	49.79725552166
But I cannot find out that Jane saw any thing of him in London .	35.2208915150996
I have no right to give my opinion , said Wickham , as to his being agreeable or otherwise .	28.06774508046377
Much as I abominate writing , I would not give up Collins's correspondence for any consideration .	23.84216118116716
exclaimed Elizabeth , you are too good .	168.99386123325937
But really , and upon my honour , I will try to do what I think to be wisest ;	33.42167119296238
Lydia , my love , ring the bell .	87.53891243984471
I beg your pardon ;	276.0261431083962
Is there nothing you could take , to give you present relief ?	33.96282364201428
She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution , which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments , which she could not otherwise have failed of ;	9.252390951937898
and in spite of her youth and her manners , she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her .	17.422938318717144
it told them , that on his arrival , he had immediately found out his brother , and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch street .	19.512568501544372
but I heard nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield .	50.791126487038106
but proud and conceited .	286.4301831219551
Now be sincere ;	556.0601261702571
He only told me , what I have now told you .	56.64411323117608
Oh , that I knew how it was !	135.65471647007027
The fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious attention .	24.689247694848167
and she sat down directly to the instrument .	107.16181764888968
A short pause followed this speech , and Hurst began again .	40.97933787423676
My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them .	27.19694122137274
To no creature had it been revealed , where secresy was possible , except to Elizabeth ;	17.81684026675902
Oh !	3082.833849588038
Elizabeth thanked him from her heart , and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying .	21.782160827530596
Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility ;	49.51654419817914
The t te- -t te surprised them .	64.84554430467134
But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire , she saw him from her dressing-room window , enter the paddock , and ride towards the house .	14.030262647957263
All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man , who , but three months before , had been almost an angel of light .	15.134176067769559
said Bennet , more than once , as if the credit of making it rain were all her own .	30.094497934526185
I am excessively attentive to all those things .	67.97262439711265
There was neither in figure nor face , any likeness between the ladies .	24.406484412137296
Bennet rang the bell , and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library .	48.3293604413012
They were excessively sorry to go !	149.6791094127526
Can this be Darcy !	276.8324886277199
I know how much you dislike him .	103.85646440066768
After watching her a little , Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful .	31.384584740262113
Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case , and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts .	11.102597756438724
You are not well enough ;	224.94746920576375
About the middle of the next day , as she was in her room getting ready for a walk , a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion ;	14.827304201948847
Darcy said nothing at all .	183.9049261398228
At that moment they were met from another walk , by Hurst and Elizabeth herself .	30.15276918025724
repeated Miss Bingley .	795.1996899360098
For the liveliness of your mind , I did .	85.94691874188585
and not a note , not a line , did I receive in the mean time .	24.067937880135943
Bennet , we shall have her at Netherfield at last .	86.40745210187794
But I knew not I was afraid of doing too much .	54.60013460208343
but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing , that instead of twelve , he had brought only six with him from London , his five sisters and a cousin .	13.217812283432666
CHAPTER XII .	1403.50908934543
They talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his fruit , of every thing but himself ;	33.2371854339531
Well , he certainly is very agreeable , and I give you leave to like him .	35.43265713069987
Their first subject was her sister ;	150.92642076605634
and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them , threw a real gloom over their domestic circle ;	10.284914930154743
She wrote cheerfully , seemed surrounded with comforts , and mentioned nothing which she could not praise .	19.504951713670618
Balls will be absolutely prohibited , unless you stand up with one of your sisters .	24.552686091477415
There can be no occasion for your going so soon .	50.42003215012114
I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure .	12.635333821961616
With many compliments to them , and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter , to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ;	12.895494648437284
It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs , under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants , and heedless of the future , must be very insufficient to their support ;	9.301097068805792
Would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part , that might offer consolation to such distress .	12.44073225632416
The dinner was exceedingly handsome , and there were all the servants , and all the articles of plate which Collins had promised ;	21.521449862287927
I rather wonder now at your knowing any .	49.95044970322687
and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement .	30.8012611856231
Mary and Kitty , thank Heaven !	118.33819073948229
She could only imagine however at last , that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible , according to his ideas of right , than in any other person present .	7.85893658071308
Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room .	25.6811074863321
The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again , called it an age since they had met , and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation .	9.43604878915205
You supposed more than really existed .	123.36899555328998
and , though little more than sixteen , her figure was formed , and her appearance womanly and graceful .	19.90314221523986
and when she wrote again , Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys .	31.767736805250692
In Lydia's imagination , a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness .	22.145551065293823
I was never more annoyed !	166.12150316323198
You have .	1583.7598620699628
Indeed , replied Elizabeth , I am heartily sorry for him ;	67.3260625674436
The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion , and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone .	11.625216368567798
and as to my father , I never in my life saw him so affected .	40.16700065303467

and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled , she had all the success she expected .	24.902202745477503
That is a question which I hardly know how to answer .	45.114808136162225
Are the others coming out ?	218.83157244255676
I do not know .	285.85979196902514
That it ought not to be attempted .	113.34195730477627
But at length , by Elizabeth's persuasion , he was prevailed on to overlook the offence , and seek a reconciliation ;	16.795435094389216
We are not in a way to know what Bingley likes , said her mother resentfully , since we are not to visit .	25.199333230023274
It was the prospect of constant society , and good society , he added , which was my chief inducement to enter the shire .	18.624832588243557
single , my dear , to be sure !	110.70205121796485
You will have a charming mother-in-law , indeed , and of course she will be always at Pemberley with you .	24.79754710944288
Elizabeth was now to see Wickham for the last time .	74.90706537740132
but not handsome enough to tempt me ;	119.43774719297905
US laws alone swamp our small staff .	58.99322241918382
with less of splendor , and more real elegance , than the furniture of Rosings .	26.753788623644446
she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us , and offered her services , or any of her daughters , if they could be of use to us .	15.651768884760012
What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation ?	62.236236737648746
I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned .	10.387441912968109
Hear me in silence .	402.5740774425126
Neglect !	6847.919774710029
but , to counterbalance these advantages , Darcy had considerable patronage in the church , and his cousin could have none at all .	16.44783247197007
Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place ?	48.58611772760931
It makes me very nervous and poorly , to be thwarted so in my own family , and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else .	12.337284314313933
Darcy looked up .	666.1329204038468
She was teazed by Collins , who continued most perseveringly by her side , and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again , put it out of her power to dance with others .	12.971762114716215
At four o'clock , therefore , we may expect this peace-making gentleman , said Bennet , as he folded up the letter .	15.959423711847919
How should you have liked making sermons ?	102.8776669275456
What could he mean ?	322.6485938156983
I have told Miss Bennet several times , that she will never play really well , unless she practises more ;	16.860032660612497
he is a most interesting young man ;	164.57872740938106
Well , I was so frightened I did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ;	26.67522793544883
Our habits of expence make us too dependant , and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money .	9.43729859890935
And your defect is a propensity to hate every body .	38.43278739203388
We are not rich enough , or grand enough for them ;	47.24555648252128
Elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness , with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal .	16.745053447488363
They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds .	27.40873818294421
1 .	4079.0161042043856
In a short time , I shall have a daughter married .	66.34110927681375
but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art ;	115.21144659582879
Charlotte the wife of Collins , was a most humiliating picture !	49.607285681373156
With my mother up stairs .	177.17052040965032
On this subject I have nothing more to say , no other apology to offer .	30.201914430154527
Though Darcy could never receive him at Pemberley , yet , for Elizabeth's sake , he assisted him farther in his profession .	16.961272137925338
I can much more easily believe Bingley's being imposed on , than that Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night ;	11.046816194772939
I cannot acquit him of that duty ;	102.65708689002292
Good Heaven !	1450.8423596756263
Maria thought speaking out of the question , and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire .	24.92107547818471
Imprudent as a marriage between Wickham and our poor Lydia would be , we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place , for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland .	10.720607079906054
I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner .	19.765947729036327
They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation , and always spending more than they ought .	14.843232208860899
and no less certain is it , that I cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it .	15.494854430359325
He only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town , which you must acknowledge to be true .	17.199786208942687
Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth , which spoke her distress at such premeditation , and her intreaty that she would not give into it .	15.663158262818191
He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him ;	18.29205599708187
and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry .	15.552348341625747
Poor Lydia's situation must , at best , be bad enough ;	33.833693719603566
and therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , I will take it on myself .	17.61875762603306
The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed , by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking ;	14.298234271283949
It was not in their direct road , nor more than a mile or two out of it .	23.847879227800142
As for Mary , she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection , soon after they were seated at table , This is a most unfortunate affair ;	11.779036633095147
Well , said Charlotte , I wish Jane success with all my heart ;	42.48543399062625
that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars , and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer .	7.2902310259253
By you , I was properly humbled .	140.31540146412732
While settling this point , she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell , and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself , who had once before called late in the evening , and might now come to enquire particularly after her .	10.1622929129005
1 .	4079.0161042043856
Oh !	3082.833849588038
Whatever can give his sister any pleasure , is sure to be done in a moment .	30.853508550174723
Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves ?	59.74808297694881
but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her , that she was only exceedingly shy .	30.349754626907075
And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last November , for had it been otherwise , I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace .	7.3619565816669885
' Are any of your younger sisters out , Miss Bennet ?	56.50358867921122
Multiple superscripted characters are enclosed by curly brackets ( example : M rs ) .	12.556850957703224
she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not to believe it , and could not help saying so .	13.226092352338435
He should be particularly happy at any time , c .	50.45373314252242
The perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing , or on the evenness of his lines , or on the length of his letter , with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received , formed a curious dialogue , and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each .	9.00453799103255

If he wants our society , let him seek it .	38.139352971571
As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their aunt , and all Collins's scruples of leaving and Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted , the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton ;	6.589408394780783

With respect to Wickham , the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation ;	19.8550273054151
It did .	1589.4056639532405
He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her ;	25.96788560963081
CHAPTER XIII .	1311.7971600904
They battled it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved .	15.589379880693938
but really considering his descent , one could not expect much better .	37.89124084117426
After a short pause , her companion added , You are too generous to trifle with me .	20.506806746444337
They can only wish his happiness , and if he is attached to me , no other woman can secure it .	18.380770859046308
I admire the activity of your benevolence , observed Mary , but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason ;	14.521964395573471
I hope you saw her petticoat , six inches deep in mud , I am absolutely certain ;	16.66367942887715
They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time , and though I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions , I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible .	6.682316556217867
I thought I should have died .	144.04148506177577
and , before Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt , of which her daughter sat in momentary dread , Bingley , who wanted to be alone with Jane , proposed their all walking out .	10.28092087393441
It needed all Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity .	15.813364392354641
You alluded to something else .	154.48336436631226
He promises fairly , and I hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent .	11.147460194541774
and indeed , before we left Bakewell , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country .	19.62650565760498
and on these occasions , Gardiner , rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's warm commendation of him , narrowly observed them both .	11.997419459018305
Respect , esteem , and confidence , had vanished for ever ;	55.6235553148965
and he went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town .	32.52408562454724
Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly ;	97.33504719484463
Those to her mother , contained little else , than that they were just returned from the library , where such and such officers had attended them , and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild ;	8.975098182357176
but would my giving you the wished-for promise , make their marriage at all more probable ?	19.504140418809772
Nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the United States .	27.53639366577409
But I hope you will get over it , and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood .	13.046405700878267
The recollection of what I then said , of my conduct , my manners , my expressions during the whole of it , is now , and has been many months , inexpressibly painful to me .	16.008256687477697
Aye , no doubt ;	507.71302272406103
She said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence ;	25.470000446936744
We cannot suppose he would help it , if he could .	52.41713949215404
I am the happiest creature in the world .	67.34418452429398
and then you must stay all night .	87.50033474737637
How could he spare half ten thousand pounds ?	56.175409393720976
Perhaps by and bye I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones .	11.855728851997782
Though Elizabeth would not , for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine , have answered this question ;	24.418223951405853
What you ask , said Elizabeth , is no sacrifice on my side ;	39.50404332161428
She was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ;	52.13752117116828
I must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from declaring my amazement , at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married .	8.554629963208559
to the young ladies he certainly was nothing ;	112.954585657192
Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort , much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements .	8.801404841510463
and how Lydia could ever have attached him , had appeared incomprehensible .	34.8541292807197
My uncle is to send a servant for us .	63.3270820449215
I see the imprudence of it .	147.51246845225052
Books Oh !	1574.5157460026173
I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well and indeed so I do still at my heart ;	12.56844140451651
Scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning , but their visit to Rosings .	29.47212566603619
I was ready to die of laughter .	84.33824747552909
I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible .	14.904995325122128
CHAPTER XXII .	1575.3856872474946
but consider how much it must increase his disappointment .	47.21767862236477
Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall ;	18.96182336450779
Elizabeth's courage did not fail her .	149.33819504605924
and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations .	15.443077648359223
is not there a little mistake ?	184.22410306428017
The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends ;	14.167971848506134
Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above-mentioned ;	31.948794648960437
We have not met since the 26th of November , when we were all dancing together at Netherfield .	16.934685560917178
Are you not diverted ?	329.03784846130935
The communication excited many professions of concern ;	65.20801611291931
He came to tell Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both , Wickham repeatedly , Lydia once .	13.000461895897022
each of them deep in thought .	151.44517026690175
You saw me dance at Meryton , I believe , Yes , indeed , and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight .	18.90261252641371
Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother , but remained quietly in the hall , till she and Kitty were out of sight , then returned into the drawing-room .	13.363726790136324
and as she walked up and down the room , endeavouring to compose herself , saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt , as made every thing worse .	10.162462139935876
With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family , and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton , sometimes dirty and sometimes cold , did January and February pass away .	7.444927068091744
Darcy smiled ;	1574.6682309829173
but to speak with such civility , to enquire after her family !	59.262076068591796
and Sir William , to Elizabeth's high diversion , was stationed in the doorway , in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him , and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that way .	10.925435007108632
Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship .	32.23482005271109
A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued , on either side calm and concise and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister , just returned from their walk .	8.304222561645846
Could I expect it to be otherwise !	120.04122937249537
and soon laying it wholly aside , she drew near the card-table , and stationed herself between Bingley and his eldest sister , to observe the game .	12.719184641760817
To and Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself .	29.221581454997896
I do , I do like him , she replied , with tears in her eyes , I love him .	32.469363978903324
Yes , she will do for him very well .	95.49856258328032
and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again .	14.488689971999996
To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted , than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement .	15.437838021594276
But if we do not venture , somebody else will ;	42.33155058900987
The invitation was accepted of course , and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine's drawing-room .	17.792334888397484
It has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling .	25.509571724086992
and she read it again .	201.63933401408806
It is impossible that he should still love me .	51.21133301174588
but though he was now established only as a tenant , Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table , nor was Hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her .	7.1333484714788
The eldest of them , a sensible , intelligent young woman , about twenty-seven , was Elizabeth's intimate friend .	20.11589678461485
Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding , and made no answer .	28.273982683620876
Her carriage remained at the door , and Elizabeth saw that her waiting-woman was in it .	31.288499338234946
In this quiet way , the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away .	31.491027896320276
but at last on Bennet's leaving them together , after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master , she could not help saying , Oh !	10.130213696905882
I rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it would happen .	37.88106157043813
and it was settled that Jones should be sent for early in the morning , if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better .	17.932116260877926
Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's meditated elopement .	29.407666310890793
I knew you would be wishing me joy .	82.67607584463944
His letter was soon dispatched ;	226.9816048506311
do we ?	1813.3759930166761
To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying .	49.50587946146023
We dine at Rosings twice every week , and are never allowed to walk home .	24.32703805524347
I do not know who is good enough for him .	42.264267547822286
But Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on , in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice .	8.033446539402584
Then , perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying , she added , Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson ;	9.225541792882792
These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship , and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay .	12.319120844355812
Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit .	76.99998377803615
and were informed that it was but just done , to give pleasure to Miss Darcy , who had taken a liking to the room , when last at Pemberley .	15.76761444061217
but why did not you tell me so before ?	82.03058179256804
To walk three miles , or four miles , or five miles , or whatever it is , above her ancles in dirt , and alone , quite alone !	11.9207802415709
But , my dearest Jane , you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday , or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend .	8.367200416668087
'Tis an etiquette I despise , said he .	61.91801856593603
This part of his intelligence , though unheard by Lydia , was caught by Elizabeth , and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make .	6.534812432616149
Well , my dear , said Bennet , when Elizabeth had read the note aloud , if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness , if she should die , it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Bingley , and under your orders .	9.069530930558065
At least , you should not remind your Mother of inviting him .	31.58899739262589
Allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not disgrace you , and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear Miss Eliza , ( glancing at her sister and Bingley , ) shall take place .	9.086304212502997
but as I have actually paid the visit , we cannot escape the acquaintance now .	30.432940158000896
She is not such a simpleton .	239.47868399207132
I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs , absurd and impertinent .	17.75839047709229
but he had something to direct his search , which was more than we had ;	28.67526209028093
There he had talked to her friends , when he could not to herself .	65.48254782149445
His circumstances , he assured me , and I had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad .	28.918583249421616
My father was not only fond of this young man's society , whose manners were always engaging ;	27.658068534094504
Oh !	3082.833849588038
for mine is totally different .	146.16843856864423
It was the second week in May , in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch-street , for the town of in Hertfordshire ;	13.674556338911414
If there were but such another man for you !	49.559801430469314
Pray make my excuses to Pratt , for not keeping my engagement , and dancing with him to-night .	18.903272076844825
If I have wounded your sister's feelings , it was unknowingly done ;	40.28428392055344
Bingley followed his advice .	278.6145194925745
and after all , Long and her nieces must stand their chance ;	35.646089318681895
She declared her resolution .	305.3114538877531
He made no answer .	288.05895234018334
and really , all things considered , I begin to think it perfectly reasonable .	32.669232647278015
Promise me , therefore , to come to Hunsford .	103.7440653541872
and so generous , that you will always exceed your income .	45.13794954408578
We must not all expect Jane's good fortune .	56.44678503198125
and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued , I remember , when we first knew her in Hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ;	12.527303899860588
I beg you will not go .	168.83560591393044
A report of a most alarming nature , reached me two days ago .	25.69600459511092
His affection was proved to have been sincere , and his conduct cleared of all blame , unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend .	12.769920268195929
No ;	5515.523422156578
Yes , yes .	632.6420150853457
She is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else .	31.194947945553125
whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish .	11.037055223131967
and , in my opinion , exertion should always be in proportion to what is required .	24.545220526442677
Did you speak from your own observation , said she , when you told him that my sister loved him , or merely from my information last spring ?	12.671495109448706
The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation .	38.978146098227256
Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight , but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction .	13.54374803321122
Any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn , I suppose , would appear far .	27.657547075930523
I want to talk very seriously .	144.5356055363
Who are your uncles and aunts ?	83.40341275328768
This was agreed to , and Philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets , and a little bit of hot supper afterwards .	12.99947999216171
A man of honour could not have doubted the intention , but Darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation , and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance , imprudence , in short any thing or nothing .	6.989869682195534
Where does discretion end , and avarice begin ?	73.86179548013095
and , allowing for the loss of Sir William , and there being only one card table in the evening , every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first .	13.800020373882807
When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over , he naturally returned to all his former indolence .	11.40109806243235
CHAPTER IX .	1311.7971600904
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her sister , and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case , was almost incredible !	11.181514310984358
He saw Wickham , and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia .	49.490420823927046
Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them .	36.4043622632908
You know I have .	566.788415945935
It will then be publicly seen , that on both sides , we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance .	14.060640501664661
He wrote last week to hurry my return .	45.12966243874464
Jane then took it from her pocket-book , and gave it to Elizabeth .	48.73654622292472
There is but such a quantity of merit between them ;	42.555505947838085
As she spoke , she observed him looking at her earnestly , and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness , convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth .	7.923028310002447
Well , and so we breakfasted at ten as usual ;	46.111662664568314
Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her .	96.727255445418
And this is your real opinion !	131.33314713775445
and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her , was still more strange .	28.1812106407983
She felt that she had no business at Pemberley , and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it .	17.230351879639997
but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it ;	46.835716570411606
and he soon afterwards said aloud , Bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day ?	12.47609656207148
Before Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise , Bennet instantly answered , Oh dear !	19.45338208463533
and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her , was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held .	16.682107072108035
And you saw him frequently ?	192.57898972574074
DEAR SIR , The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father , always gave me much uneasiness , and since I have had the misfortune to lose him , I have frequently wished to heal the breach ;	8.16439101935037
No , I should have turned in a moment .	78.23705024659945
Could he , or the Lucases , have pitched on any man , within the circle of our acquaintance , whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related ?	10.151278822345164
we talked and laughed so loud , that any body might have heard us ten miles off !	20.624051152642917
and , on the father's , from respectable , honourable , and ancient , though untitled families .	26.112649331030198
She was now , on being settled at home , at leisure to observe the real state of her sister's spirits .	22.98713259190795
so , it will be impossible for her to introduce him , for she will not know him herself .	43.41292076530002
What think you of this sentence , my dear Lizzy ?	59.91795889415269
Jane's is nothing to it nothing at all .	83.20347233783247
How could she deny that credit to his assertions , in one instance , which she had been obliged to give in the other ?	21.339307812958307
I dare say the lace upon Hurst's gown Here she was interrupted again .	22.428615091721312
and Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn , nothing remained to be done but to go ;	18.72969356711681
Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible .	70.96474297305365
and there is no occasion for talking to him , except just now and then .	34.65508632577191
I dearly love a laugh .	164.96406286875296
but without much success .	360.5011078715487
They saw him often , and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve .	24.845457344935877
said he , with a look of doubt .	76.25122424901733
Poor Eliza !	1594.5643351963172
Speak to Lizzy about it yourself .	118.37919020961833
Not at all , was her answer ;	154.11643620486038
The same anxiety to get them by themselves , was visible again in the evening .	31.336919685455186
But he is an ugly fellow !	127.39068054384724
Yes , yes , they must marry .	107.37395898814749
Thursday was to be the wedding day , and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit ;	28.878781906671843
and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future ;	14.83269119640408
but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at .	60.51109106153142
Remember that she is one of a large family ;	113.61006911872067
They called at various times of the morning , sometimes separately , sometimes together , and now and then accompanied by their aunt .	16.15460362400142
Bingley , his two sisters , the husband of the eldest , and another young man .	51.113784545378174
Intimate as you are , you must know how it is to be done .	53.97416425123884
My father supported him at school , and afterwards at Cambridge ;	37.408585796141345
for when supper was over , singing was talked of , and she had the mortification of seeing Mary , after very little entreaty , preparing to oblige the company .	11.241892263988213
and their conversation , which had been passing while and Gardiner were engaged with their children , was now put an end to , by the approach of the whole party .	14.250476535002386
But Georgiana would not join her .	126.1400911196581
With respect to that other , more weighty accusation , of having injured Wickham , I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family .	11.74742700975138
Yet the misery , for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation , received soon afterwards material relief , from observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her former lover .	9.183870240032515
Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile .	106.50342528362985
It distressed her a little , and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage .	19.52758170624614
But I have other provocations .	211.33963588745524
He studies too much for words of four syllables .	42.662503072557165
From their infancy , they have been intended for each other .	45.39662322179833
he had all the best part of beauty , a fine countenance , a good figure , and very pleasing address .	28.08333586599304
and she asked Bingley , whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present .	30.27461115307057
They followed her into the dining-parlour .	157.00363445894976
and after some contrivance , the whole party , with all their boxes , workbags , and parcels , and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's and Lydia's purchases , were seated in it .	10.098459296802513
On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls , whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room , and whose shyness , as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth , prevented their coming lower .	7.7092919744546995
but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour .	34.54287415765186
and on his return , brought back , with great satisfaction , a message from her Ladyship , importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her .	10.708515080142512
I have no reason , I assure you , said he , to be dissatisfied with my reception .	26.156843962623082
In essentials , I believe , he is very much what he ever was .	42.830288314930804
Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday ;	65.9309415309061
and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there ;	23.20961705110669
and they soon became sensible , that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old , and whose own manners indicated respectability , was not to be hastily rejected .	11.340736420390211
Bromley , of course .	477.66989331525104
Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth , where confidence would give pleasure ;	35.631064931270245
What congratulations will then flow in !	97.31803866872426
My dear Bennet , said his lady to him one day , have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last ?	15.625672532685348
His countenance rather gained in austerity ;	82.84621397236475
The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family , connections , or fortune .	32.063424649076865
I do not know of any other designs that he had formed : but he was in such a hurry to be gone , and his spirits so greatly discomposed , that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this .	11.344231438420088
He has always something to say to every body .	64.03326293515718
but there were two or three much uglier in the shop ;	44.10673904166636
If he wishes to avoid seeing me , he must go .	53.27159028589008
Have you not heard me say , that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ?	22.184167293065016
and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before , was now high in her good graces .	24.94901153669679
she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ;	45.276961830148714
Bennet , you are wanted immediately ;	208.91833607713247
My real purpose was to see you , and to judge , if I could , whether I might ever hope to make you love me .	19.5953287278205
Oh !	3082.833849588038
He made a little mistake to be sure ;	108.23971333072878
This event had at last been despaired of , but it was then too late to be saving .	23.579162923735023
On this subject , what can you have to say ?	82.97244518568746
But will they make you happy ?	99.01651496856074
She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment ;	61.571241009926965
There could be no conversation in the noise of Philips's supper party , but his manners recommended him to every body .	19.674364117707434
An union of a different tendency , and precluding the possibility of the other , was soon to be formed in their family .	25.38001659446894
Yes ;	4459.007412392422
Elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ;	32.67561251030812
Did you see him while you were at Lambton ?	73.98253983264233
I do comprehend a great deal in it .	67.288484904138
Did she call to refuse her consent ?	65.57416352842782
They must have seen them together for ever .	78.39467559398841
With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew ;	74.64527506471192
I am sure my sisters must all envy me .	37.875166077642135
I hope we may often meet again .	83.53280463700216
There was not much in the question , nor in the preceding remark , but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning .	20.8778369764094
She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of Darcy's sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , she turned up the lane , which led her farther from the turnpike road .	9.578956066062096
His sister was less delicate , and directed her eye towards Darcy with a very expressive smile .	23.511931119437083
Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend .	27.18503950338928
I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Bingley .	26.766780399181823
Bingley is most unaffectedly modest .	174.9800178739306
With a renewal of tenderness , however , they repaired to her room on leaving the dining-parlour , and sat with her till summoned to coffee .	14.533375673028168
Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment .	3.257322539223137
With a glance she saw , that he had lost none of his recent civility ;	30.416269035655713
Would Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it ?	9.8158813710722
But above all , above respect and esteem , there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked .	13.975423690450901
There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others .	18.988067889190564
And as I come back , I can call on Lady Lucas and Long .	38.74205245271158
She will be down in a moment I dare say .	59.9872763862176
There is nothing he would not do for her .	82.32255586851043
and for your own , let her be an active , useful sort of person , not brought up high , but able to make a small income go a good way .	11.740951814957553
Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed .	34.93852708837183
The dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last ;	23.66109785789302
At length , in a voice of forced calmness , he said , And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting !	15.097702953171975
she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld !	69.34841997020752
The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton ;	45.09512244736483
Very odd !	1588.491336192813
Her teeth are tolerable , but not out of the common way ;	35.899151179814005
They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in ;	32.75637056932609
but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable , they are not , I hope , quite so easily changed as that implies .	12.413079994296037
[ Illustration : DOVE-DALE ] PRIDE PREJUDICE .	61.208313844822484
Lady Catherine is a very respectable , sensible woman indeed , added Charlotte , and a most attentive neighbour .	24.518374280826162
and as for Hurst , by whom Elizabeth sat , he was an indolent man , who lived only to eat , drink , and play at cards , who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout , had nothing to say to her .	7.6643975068357575
and when Bingley was gone , Jane constantly sought the same means of relief .	27.986024668332398
and the kind of half-expectation which Gardiner had formed , of their being followed by a letter from him , had ended in nothing .	14.458838759461063
She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter .	64.15140001377407
After wandering along the lane for two hours , giving way to every variety of thought ;	17.232184772549605
and such I might still have been but for you , dearest , loveliest Elizabeth !	27.712336497281015
Much had been done , and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday ;	37.31386293110741
And his behaviour , so strikingly altered , what could it mean ?	37.25566516831321
My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking .	30.554434005823843
It was gratitude .	550.208146919684
One morning , about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been formed , as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining-room , their attention was suddenly drawn to the window , by the sound of a carriage ;	10.65793424160796
Certainly , he replied , biting his lips .	72.73696068504917
I honour your circumspection .	249.62846486061102
and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general , he can have no objection , I am sure , to oblige us for one half hour .	11.944162820337443
Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these .	45.867946843144786
He is gone to my father already .	117.32792324783142
When the ladies were separating for the toilette , he said to Elizabeth , Do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your apparel .	12.225871978824234
He bore it with noble indifference , and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy , had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Darcy , with an expression of half-laughing alarm .	10.31459616401367
and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery .	8.52398170522318
and Wickham had constant admission to the house .	84.49799868853512
and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly commendable , and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate , will be kindly overlooked on your side , and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch .	5.986213111155456
she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood , nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two , to visit his relations .	13.701202554375326
but she had not got beyond the words delightful , and charming , when some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her , might be mischievously construed .	11.570262754686905
Very well and this offer of marriage you have refused ?	45.46908841507613
My dear Hill , have you heard the good news ?	47.17434841617864
They crossed it by a simple bridge , in character with the general air of the scene ;	28.825491275812077
You appear to me , Darcy , to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection .	28.000046652224157
Well , and so just as the carriage came to the door , my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Stone .	15.707329137647964
In my opinion , the younger son of an Earl can know very little of either .	25.917614150321914
and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification .	28.71463025094142
Had you then persuaded yourself that I should ?	83.40335729910478
and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling .	13.0503412159372
that if he is so , you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me .	30.15338428138439
and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night , she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon .	10.586639934589986
I do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Darcy .	14.51226866207807
Had she merely dined with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ;	22.04588823424675
but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him .	24.4347668558514
dear Lizzy , only consider what he must have suffered .	65.37613119241665
I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure .	42.3738030078419
That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side , too , was another very welcome surprise ;	19.561029332543512
In spite of having been at James's , Sir William was so completely awed , by the grandeur surrounding him , that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow , and take his seat without saying a word ;	9.95150725870165
my dear , cried his wife , I cannot bear to hear that mentioned .	33.88698779733268
You can now have nothing farther to say , she resentfully answered .	38.99494406454234
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States .	10.905205229485095
How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year !	28.768015955829025
Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Philips , and she ventured , without any permission , to do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton .	16.40801273949328
Her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour : his judgment could not err , and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth , as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable .	8.690101539039416
and he found in Philips a very attentive listener , whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard , and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could .	10.18516836634009
When Lydia went away , she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and Kitty ;	22.8132528505347
It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom .	41.322816491583765
Their eyes instantly met , and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush .	22.270673374173935
Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed , as to leave her very little attention for her book ;	28.066955840925093
She was even sensible of some pleasure , though mixed with regret , on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Darcy and herself .	8.645428372561819
and she was more grieved than astonished to hear , in reply to her minute enquiries , that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits , there were periods of dejection .	10.000436167090337
And may I ask ?	323.9139939091573
In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure , said Bingley ;	45.99697997015294
and more than once during dinner did Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth , I am glad you are come back , Lizzy .	16.954662457756115
your father of course may spare you , if your mother can .	45.044397550316084
and of late it has been shifting about pretty much .	44.06924740707719
its solace was visiting and news .	82.75215873141939
Have you seen any pleasant men ?	94.24935532178122
But Bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own .	18.943055195507824
Elizabeth hesitated , but her knees trembled under her , and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them .	15.711551478351806
You have only proved by this , cried Elizabeth , that Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition .	22.292283666472148
but I believe we must abide by our original plan .	39.38721556207632
for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health , and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight .	14.562714650148417
That is all to be forgot .	226.48355035634557
and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Bennet's being quite unable to sit alone .	14.002098852466544
You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night .	28.265137913760917
Yes , I really believe Darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care .	14.588627018661402
She is up stairs , and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all .	38.25674387934226
With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added , How long did you say that he was at Rosings ?	19.609523372848866
People did say , you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas ;	30.93523591574434
She put down the letter , weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality deliberated on the probability of each statement but with little success .	11.708611426119578
Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing , after all .	36.9536931990794
But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side , said Jane .	30.484802805529558
Implacable resentment is a shade in a character .	87.33572722655639
FITZWILLIAM DARCY .	1571.4439182596846
Your reproof , so well applied , I shall never forget : 'had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner .	14.929275588347668
at first .	2029.0648540642437
The letter shall certainly be burnt , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard ;	19.254236692160468
And there is something of dignity in his countenance , that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart .	22.648991310521076
Oh !	3082.833849588038
Her father , contented with laughing at them , would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters ;	14.648861940498199
Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow , and sat down again to her work , with an eagerness which it did not often command .	14.217279111690761
and , alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother , we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London .	11.210651936545268
to the last .	1451.5487578680859
Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt , and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description , when Hurst called them to order , with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward .	6.920462364943513
Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea , and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies .	10.563405258162
And you only the second .	212.0655357437711
Philips was always glad to see her nieces , and the two eldest , from their recent absence , were particularly welcome , and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home , which , as their own carriage had not fetched them , she should have known nothing about , if she had not happened to see Jones's shop boy in the street , who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away , when her civility was claimed towards Collins by Jane's introduction of him .	6.370838464367843
What a letter is this , to be written at such a moment .	51.6339800268266
for though the chief of his concerns , with the son of his patron , were imperfectly understood , it was yet a well known fact that , on his quitting Derbyshire , he had left many debts behind him , which Darcy afterwards discharged .	9.478180620215088
There are few people whom I really love , and still fewer of whom I think well .	25.540555613578714
His debts to be discharged , and something still to remain !	59.52571928960351
and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino , the two girls had the honour of assisting Jenkinson to make up her party .	11.888597605857036
It soothed , but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self-attracted by the rest of her family ;	22.397336252359548
But your family owe me nothing .	98.19837042481578
Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad ?	43.79067826254231
Oh !	3082.833849588038

Even Elizabeth began to fear not that Bingley was indifferent but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away .	16.361006345664478
The satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her husband , might then have rested in its proper place .	9.903693743183744
and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs , to think of any thing else .	15.679576167499345
but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line .	22.521214465274568
I believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as I do .	34.02360822923003
The party seemed so well selected , so suitable one with the other .	31.388177190499853
But when they see , as I trust they will , that their brother is happy with me , they will learn to be contented , and we shall be on good terms again ;	14.437121160973845
Do let us have a little music , cried Miss Bingley , tired of a conversation in which she had no share .	20.795607215037712
She answered in the affirmative , and , unable to resist the temptation , added , When you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance .	9.999227233369123
It was not known that Wickham had a single relation , with whom he kept up any connection , and it was certain that he had no near one living .	12.794111301885495
and Elizabeth , after all the misery of the morning , found herself , in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed , seated in the carriage , and on the road to Longbourn .	16.501446013024903
It is every way horrible !	146.4755662917454
cried Miss Bingley , Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable .	38.1742921198669
and the other , that she herself had been barbarously used by them all ;	36.34320443627741
The usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter .	44.264263748725426
It is unaccountable !	551.5069042392012
Bennet made no answer , and each of them , deep in thought , continued silent till they reached the house .	15.57113608065107
The others have been gone on to Scarborough , these three weeks .	36.80020991386618
I am not likely to leave Kent for some time .	51.81782735191186
I am thinking of what you have been telling me , said she .	43.63674044174251
he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen !	64.84859186233902
I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals , but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them .	19.814776176369
About a month , said Elizabeth ;	143.3148832009975
She could think of nothing more to say ;	78.79510021878646
I am very glad you liked her .	83.70884381170872
He called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil , which had been brought on by himself .	16.45829214605375
You are all kindness , Madam ;	129.22150233129653
She will follow wherever Lydia leads .	83.5032489300601
What a contrast between him and his friend !	83.94764215599682
Ah !	5682.7059499578245
indeed you have no reason .	332.924181551841
In her own past behaviour , there was a constant source of vexation and regret ;	23.041362851128653
If I may so express it , he has a right to be proud .	43.858992930552155
Only think of its being three months , she cried , since I went away ;	33.05290309478896
if the first , I should be completely in your way ;	63.27018505496064
He was as generous , she doubted not , as the most generous of his sex .	33.213830421513265
And this , cried Darcy , as he walked with quick steps across the room , is your opinion of me !	24.964117149359552
If I , said Collins , were so fortunate as to be able to sing , I should have great pleasure , I am sure , in obliging the company with an air ;	16.968116786658253
and Lydia , in a voice rather louder than any other person's , was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her .	12.746110767420722
She seems perfectly happy , however , and in a prudential light , it is certainly a very good match for her .	20.43363137178441
E1 .	6125.411827414266
Invented by M rs Bell 26 Charlotte Street Bedford Square .	24.623201692774057
and had some new extracts to admire , and some new observations of thread-bare morality to listen to .	16.037730552605897
True , said Bennet , but it is a comfort to think that , whatever of that kind may befal you , you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it .	12.673489133672732
certainly , said Elizabeth , though burning with curiosity ;	70.97517925904046
or , with a mind so occupied , she might have forgotten where she was .	32.15231726029663
Oh !	3082.833849588038
Regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure , but I wrote to Wickham , who left the place immediately , and Younge was of course removed from her charge .	10.29179656556181
I know it cannot be long .	155.68935889168307
My beauty you had early withstood , and as for my manners my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not .	9.7757792613884
But there was still something lurking behind , of which prudence forbad the disclosure .	22.453357044639944
These were the contents : MY DEAR HARRIET , You will laugh when you know where I am gone , and I cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning , as soon as I am missed .	10.485684581286682
and every body began to find out , that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness .	29.49731459555784
But I ought to beg his pardon , for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant .	20.47041431544547
With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted !	45.725401925202405
She had high animal spirits , and a sort of natural self-consequence , which the attentions of the officers , to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her , had increased into assurance .	9.468250059491163
but unable to contain herself , began scolding one of her daughters .	42.47015746438006
Heaven forbid !	1399.997372406987
and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again .	33.36575459462295
Colonel Forster came yesterday , having left Brighton the day before , not many hours after the express .	19.541439824499356
Not a word , however , passed his lips in allusion to it , till their visitor took his leave for the night ;	13.99385150965683
It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Darcy than they had before any idea of ;	28.48260636438894
I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude .	21.058560267665044
but now , as soon as they were alone together , she said , I saw you look at me to-day , Lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present report ;	14.206822328364366
Lydia was Lydia still ;	269.9242146199503
I should have considered it as part of my duty , and the exertion would soon have been nothing .	24.259305022432923
I was very uncomfortable , I may say unhappy .	70.10552549919397
And your assurance of it , I suppose , carried immediate conviction to him .	26.57656696818181
and Mary , at the end of a long concerto , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs , at the request of her younger sisters , who with some of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room .	7.308617028404287
though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them .	17.470967069365244
To work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures ;	47.668365278006185
He could even listen to Sir William Lucas , when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country , and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at James's , with very decent composure .	8.126043572099066
and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own .	12.22548937858388
and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and at first was resolved not to break it ;	15.61662598293873
Her mind was less difficult to develope .	88.88932559805926
Oh !	3082.833849588038
that of Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest ;	105.53326703540803
Instead of viewing them as a stranger , I might have rejoiced in them as my own , and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt .	13.980657253366292
and as Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her's , it was performed in a proper manner , without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary .	11.672463306420216
was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room , and from all the others when they sat down to table .	16.866917380936993
his sisters declared that they were miserable .	126.91597466770592
It had not been very great ;	201.96465378574237
You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary , compressed , marked up , nonproprietary or proprietary form , including any word processing or hypertext form .	5.626432996013289
And so , my dear sister , I find from our uncle and aunt , that you have actually seen Pemberley .	20.52102242587814
The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week ;	27.32220720617881
I do , indeed , replied Elizabeth , colouring .	78.48710868143831
A person may be proud without being vain .	71.99160310487814
For the truth of every thing here related , I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam , who from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the executors of my father's will , has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions .	7.357793390798289
I shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his constancy .	29.350872651787885
I should never have said Collins was settled near her family .	44.27684704964385
Wretched , wretched , mistake !	135.16552149551865
Those who do not complain are never pitied .	64.86408768975171
Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete , old , middle-aged and new computers .	6.074997210960625
How differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned !	37.97156268880824
Elizabeth , you are not serious now .	136.2788966391354
All this was acknowledged to Gardiner ;	138.34395396892793
What a fine thing for our girls !	84.6393172090187
You did !	1572.5739891945032
No man of common humanity , no man who had any value for his character , could be capable of it .	20.45962098383613
but at length was reduced to be reasonable .	90.15439547199612
It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Bingley to see you all after him so soon ;	23.774665806851512
An excellent consolation in its way , said Elizabeth , but it will not do for us .	27.887148088921386
Nothing had ever suggested it before , but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter , than by supposing a partiality for their niece .	11.157966635730196
But , he added , you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them , with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here .	14.885487925255056
Is there one among the sex , who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman ?	17.545554021755354
At length , she spoke again .	170.5389376378073
and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement .	85.16997542873612
See <URL> Transcriber's note : Text enclosed by underscores is in italics ( italics ) .	12.26241367418721
I have just as much right to be asked as she has , and more too , for I am two years older .	25.43701006630436
he shook his head when I expressed my hopes , and said he feared W was not a man to be trusted .	18.42344092602067
My dear Lizzy , where can you have been walking to ?	57.74276614163796
After a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner , and thus began , In vain have I struggled .	12.575478361025366
But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault because I would not take the trouble of practising .	19.768069819282488
and , of course , I could not rest till I knew the particulars .	47.42900559005627
That lady I suppose is your mother .	101.66348200034477
and on their being seated , a pause , awkward as such pauses must always be , succeeded for a few moments .	13.704123978212902
From the former .	681.2960177333719
There was one part especially , the opening of it , which I should dread your having the power of reading again .	16.233364193344688
They came .	1573.3462216920384
and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed .	12.102511396042647
Wickham is safe .	655.5924311011298
and Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem .	30.08804004924422
Many stared .	1601.7716826265457
