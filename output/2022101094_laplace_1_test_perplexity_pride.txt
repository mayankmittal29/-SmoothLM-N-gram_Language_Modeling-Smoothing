Average perplexity: 544186.9393770971
I am not at all afraid of her dying .	402938.22690930456
and so accomplished !	1464745.9913903195
but without scheming to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery .	220628.02418416445
She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest , by talking of their supposed marriage , and planning his happiness in such an alliance .	209720.11926061154
Hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was very glad ;	287917.9352426727
I told you in the library , you know , that I should never speak to you again , and you will find me as good as my word .	201317.51640173607
The house , furniture , neighbourhood , and roads , were all to her taste , and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most friendly and obliging .	213027.94172063502
and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle directly .	265208.36875681544
If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection , Elizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty .	235335.18749647937
My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness , and in a cause of such moment as this , I shall certainly not depart from it .	201317.51640173607
The pain of separation , however , might be alleviated on his side , by preparations for the reception of his bride , as he had reason to hope , that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire , the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men .	170433.8703022177
No , I thank you ;	744997.1111468794
I have suspected it some time , but I am now convinced .	319996.27800304984
Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again , and weakened her disgust of Collins .	265208.36875681544
It was unpardonable .	1464745.9913903195
No , said Colonel Fitzwilliam , that is an advantage which he must divide with me .	265208.36875681544
and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the probability of a rainy season , made her feel that the commonest , dullest , most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker .	169780.45008779215
Their visitors staid with them above half an hour , and when they arose to depart , Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing and Gardiner , and Miss Bennet , to dinner at Pemberley , before they left the country .	174139.77156307746
But upon my honour I do not .	511728.00322052115
She blushed , and Jane blushed ;	603117.8376712757
I promised them so faithfully !	744997.1111468794
which are naturally lively enough .	744997.1111468794
It was a subject , in short , on which reflection would be long indulged , and must be unavailing .	235335.18749647937
The rooms were lofty and handsome , and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor ;	256190.74520215756
and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour Lady Lucas .	265208.36875681544
but Darcy , at whom it was all aimed , was still inflexibly studious .	287917.9352426727
What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosing's Park , when he put his letter into her hand !	225021.6135296377
Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas , for Collins was only a clergyman ;	265208.36875681544
The Collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave ;	287917.9352426727
Do you consider the forms of introduction , and the stress that is laid on them , as nonsense ?	241439.52775727588
As for Jane , her anxiety under this suspence was , of course , more painful than Elizabeth's ;	248337.34193872553
Indeed !	7093278.638358481
and I particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at Netherfield , '_She a beauty !	235335.18749647937
I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well , I assure you .	302466.73346396536
and , perhaps , if I have very good luck , I may meet with another Collins in time .	241439.52775727588
From herself to Jane from Jane to Bingley , her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Darcy's explanation there , had appeared very insufficient ;	198930.78305103924
My father , however , is partial to Wickham .	402938.22690930456
The dejection was almost universal .	744997.1111468794
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper ;	209720.11926061154
But in spite of all this fine talking , my dear Lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured , that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair .	182167.88622491734
No why should he ?	987395.4977649314
As Gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she and her children should go to London , at the same time that Bennet came from it .	194651.1126567522
Yet , how just a humiliation !	603117.8376712757
Nay , when I read a letter of his , I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham , much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law .	194651.1126567522
Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ?	402938.22690930456
Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and which he thought the prettiest ?	192725.47726509365
In the afternoon , the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves ;	241439.52775727588
He has children of his own , and may have more .	341488.7802649577
Family pride , and filial pride , for he is very proud of what his father was , have done this .	229896.54819135778
It was to this effect : Since writing the above , dearest Lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ;	216648.58268882733
Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield , which was fixed for the following Tuesday .	213027.94172063502
This was his plan of amends of atonement for inheriting their father's estate ;	302466.73346396536
and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached .	192725.47726509365
If you will thank me , he replied , let it be for yourself alone .	275663.02399114973
I hope he will overlook it .	603117.8376712757
Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her .	511728.00322052115
that he should have been in love with her for so many months !	302466.73346396536
She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting .	341488.7802649577
and as she considered that Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations , and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct , she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before .	175865.13501774057
Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again ?	302466.73346396536
She was ashamed to think how much .	511728.00322052115
Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends ?	341488.7802649577
She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference .	287917.9352426727
1813 .	7093278.638358481
Do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart .	213027.94172063502
and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer !	287917.9352426727
Did you , on reading it , give any credit to its contents ?	302466.73346396536
When tea was over , Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table but in vain .	275663.02399114973
Yes , he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word .	341488.7802649577
and Elizabeth found , that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations' consent , there was still something to be wished for .	198930.78305103924
and neither the carriage , nor the livery of the servant who preceded it , were familiar to them .	241439.52775727588
Oh , well !	1464745.9913903195
for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ;	319996.27800304984
Is nothing due to me on that score ?	448692.4807466969
but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter and said , Jane , I congratulate you .	229896.54819135778
Bennet's best comfort was , that Bingley must be down again in the summer .	287917.9352426727
and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , I never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them .	220628.02418416445
The park paling was still the boundary on one side , and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground .	225021.6135296377
Jane certainly could not come back .	603117.8376712757
To the civil enquiries which then poured in , and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Bingley's , she could not make a very favourable answer .	192725.47726509365
He begged pardon for having displeased her .	511728.00322052115
But she is nothing to me now .	511728.00322052115
Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time .	216648.58268882733
Miss Darcy , on her brother's entrance , exerted herself much more to talk ;	287917.9352426727
He made no answer , and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton .	190924.3165773236
the nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people !	368394.5561233181
If , indeed , it should be so !	448692.4807466969
I cannot fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation .	220628.02418416445
He had rather hoped that all his wife's views on the stranger would be disappointed ;	275663.02399114973
CHAPTER XVI .	2646482.834236289
Her report was highly favourable .	744997.1111468794
Every body said how well she looked ;	511728.00322052115
He seemed scarcely to hear her , and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation ;	248337.34193872553
They were now almost at the door of the house , for she had walked fast to get rid of him ;	229896.54819135778
He is so excessively handsome !	744997.1111468794
for Long has just been here , and she told me all about it .	287917.9352426727
where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure ;	302466.73346396536
Darcy , after enquiring of her how and Gardiner did , a question which she could not answer without confusion , said scarcely any thing .	213027.94172063502
They gradually ascended for half a mile , and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence , where the wood ceased , and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House , situated on the opposite side of a valley , into which the road with some abruptness wound .	171114.14759065388
He was too happy , however , to need much attention ;	341488.7802649577
Why Jane you never dropt a word of this ;	402938.22690930456
It was all pride and insolence .	603117.8376712757
How does Georgiana get on , Darcy ?	511728.00322052115
At such a distance as that , you know , things are strangely misrepresented .	287917.9352426727
and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted .	302466.73346396536
We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured .	341488.7802649577
pray make haste and come into the dining-room , for there is such a sight to be seen !	248337.34193872553
When they were gone , Elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent .	180978.41605940924
My dear Eliza he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way .	220628.02418416445
Her ease and good spirits increased .	603117.8376712757
Elizabeth , who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Darcy had been , was much relieved by discerning such different feelings .	201317.51640173607
Oh , yes !	1464745.9913903195
, but its volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous locations .	341488.7802649577
Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship , in spite of a great opposition of character .	241439.52775727588
said Charlotte , as soon as he was gone .	402938.22690930456
There is also one other person in the party , he continued after a pause , who more particularly wishes to be known to you , Will you allow me , or do I ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton ?	172562.15617808924
When a woman has five grown up daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty .	241439.52775727588
cried his wife impatiently .	987395.4977649314
Neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude , replied Elizabeth , have any possible claim on me , in the present instance .	220628.02418416445
and addressed herself particularly to Bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation .	189236.011448061
His manners are very different from his cousin's .	448692.4807466969
But it is so strange !	744997.1111468794
About ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire , to which he belonged .	201317.51640173607
And pray what sort of guardians do you make ?	402938.22690930456
Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in my dressing-room .	341488.7802649577
Can you possibly guess , Lizzy , who is meant by this ?	319996.27800304984
You may depend upon my not mentioning it .	448692.4807466969
and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs .	220628.02418416445
and to prevent its ever happening again , took care to inform him at first , that it was a favourite haunt of hers .	216648.58268882733
certainly , cried his faithful assistant , no one can be really esteemed accomplished , who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with .	213027.94172063502
He was writing , and , without raising his head , coolly replied , Just as you please .	248337.34193872553
March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford .	511728.00322052115
Bennet was perfectly satisfied ;	987395.4977649314
When the gentlemen rose to go away , Bennet was mindful of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time .	196714.4820734748
that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking Darcy's character , though he had assured her that respect for the father , would always prevent his exposing the son .	194651.1126567522
His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost .	402938.22690930456
I have not the smallest hope .	603117.8376712757
She coloured as she spoke ;	744997.1111468794
She opened the door , and met Maria in the landing place , who , breathless with agitation , cried out , Oh , my dear Eliza !	206686.61049801102
There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed .	275663.02399114973
You shall hear what she says .	603117.8376712757
I do not see what right Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend's inclination , or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy .	179850.2585926096
A few weeks , he believed .	603117.8376712757
But think no more of the letter .	511728.00322052115
When is your next ball to be , Lizzy ?	402938.22690930456
You see how continually we are engaged there .	448692.4807466969
Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours ;	511728.00322052115
You know I always speak my mind , and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves .	225021.6135296377
See paragraph 1 .	1464745.9913903195
I am happier even than Jane ;	603117.8376712757
but it must be done soon .	603117.8376712757
they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence ;	402938.22690930456
if it must be so , it must .	448692.4807466969
I should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match , cried Elizabeth .	248337.34193872553
She followed her father to the fire place , and they both sat down .	287917.9352426727
We have judged it best , that my niece should be married from this house , of which I hope you will approve .	220628.02418416445
and , after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable composure .	220628.02418416445
Yes , she will remain there till Christmas .	448692.4807466969
Special rules , set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license , apply to copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark .	192725.47726509365
and Gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing , by the servant's account , that their niece was taken suddenly ill ;	225021.6135296377
Remember , Eliza , that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do .	287917.9352426727
but I think I shall like your husband quite as well as Jane's .	302466.73346396536
I do not think we were speaking at all .	402938.22690930456
Well , cried her mother , it is all very right ;	341488.7802649577
and Hurst , principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings , joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss Bennet .	216648.58268882733
Yet he is such a man !	603117.8376712757
You have delighted us long enough .	603117.8376712757
Bennet could hardly contain herself .	744997.1111468794
Be that as it may , she saw him go with regret ;	319996.27800304984
She had even learnt to detect , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary .	209720.11926061154
dear me !	2646482.834236289
when it was no longer likely they should meet .	402938.22690930456
but with the rich , he is liberal-minded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and perhaps agreeable , allowing something for fortune and figure .	206686.61049801102
and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him .	368394.5561233181
You blamed me for coming ?	744997.1111468794
Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield ;	368394.5561233181
and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look .	213027.94172063502
Have you any idea , Lizzy , who this gentleman is ?	341488.7802649577
It was not in her nature , however , to increase her vexations , by dwelling on them .	248337.34193872553
and even Darcy acknowledged , that the partridges were remarkably well done ;	319996.27800304984
There is something very pompous in his style .	448692.4807466969
You certainly do , she replied with a smile ;	402938.22690930456
and though Collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as I have often told her , to come to Rosings every day , and play on the piano-forte in Jenkinson's room .	190924.3165773236
Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to conciliate her .	216648.58268882733
and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet .	275663.02399114973
They contained no actual complaint , nor was there any revival of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering .	229896.54819135778
Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage ;	402938.22690930456
Kitty was the only one who shed tears ;	448692.4807466969
And then you have added so much to it yourself , you are always buying books .	265208.36875681544
This cannot be !	1464745.9913903195
and Elizabeth , who knew what curiosities his letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise .	235335.18749647937
When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer , I made a point of her having two men servants go with her .	220628.02418416445
Elizabeth , on her side , had much to do .	368394.5561233181
The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a headache ;	302466.73346396536
Indeed , Jane , you ought to believe me .	402938.22690930456
And so would Anne , if her health had allowed her to apply .	302466.73346396536
I will read it to you When my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to London , might be concluded in three or four days , but as we are certain it cannot be so , and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town , he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel .	156309.20760404118
They entered it in one of its lowest points , and drove for some time through a beautiful wood , stretching over a wide extent .	213027.94172063502
May we take my uncle's letter to read to her ?	368394.5561233181
When the card tables were placed , he had an opportunity of obliging her in return , by sitting down to whist .	225021.6135296377
After a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display .	165841.40473717582
but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands .	341488.7802649577
he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and that , if he marry prudently , his wife may teach him .	225021.6135296377
and Bennet , for many years after Lydia's birth , had been certain that he would .	265208.36875681544
and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements , new carriages and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield , in the course of three or four months .	179850.2585926096
hatred had vanished long ago , and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him , that could be so called .	206686.61049801102
But I will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well .	302466.73346396536
If his own vanity , however , did not mislead him , he was the cause , his pride and caprice were the cause of all that Jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer .	187650.33801142208
I fancy , Lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all .	265208.36875681544
Their affectionate mother shared all their grief ;	511728.00322052115
a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room .	171114.14759065388
Pray , how violent was Bingley's love ?	511728.00322052115
but Lady Catherine very resolutely , and not very politely , declined eating any thing ;	275663.02399114973
Now what have you to say ?	603117.8376712757
and in front , a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater , but without any artificial appearance .	235335.18749647937
He carved , and ate , and praised with delighted alacrity ;	341488.7802649577
E5 .	7093278.638358481
But though every thing seemed neat and comfortable , she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance ;	229896.54819135778
When I am in the country , he replied , I never wish to leave it ;	265208.36875681544
It only shews her being deficient in something herself sense or feeling .	319996.27800304984
Yes , very well .	987395.4977649314
and , though she was not very sanguine in expecting it , the application was a something to look forward to .	229896.54819135778
Is this a hint to me , Lizzy , said her father , to send for the horses ?	248337.34193872553
and more than commonly anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her .	241439.52775727588
However , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts , and I am very glad to hear what you tell us , of long sleeves .	201317.51640173607
you know he is , as well as I do ;	368394.5561233181
Pray forgive me , if I have been very presuming , or at least do not punish me so far , as to exclude me from P I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park .	180978.41605940924
Your idea of the ponies is delightful .	511728.00322052115
then recollecting himself , I will not detain you a minute , but let me , or let the servant , go after and Gardiner .	213027.94172063502
In the first place , he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron .	213027.94172063502
but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you .	448692.4807466969
Bennet could not have chosen better .	603117.8376712757
and know them to be so much attached to me !	368394.5561233181
Her sister made not the smallest objection , and the piano-forte was opened , and Darcy , after a few moments recollection , was not sorry for it .	203894.9364609667
Elizabeth was surprised , but said not a word .	402938.22690930456
CHAPTER X More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park , unexpectedly meet Darcy .	256190.74520215756
They have none of them much to recommend them , replied he ;	319996.27800304984
After walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on resuming their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant , there chanced to be a little alteration .	174139.77156307746
and Collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much .	341488.7802649577
and yet it should seem by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy .	209720.11926061154
I dare say you believed it ;	603117.8376712757
You are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on ;	275663.02399114973
nothing , therefore , could be fairly conjectured from that , though Elizabeth , who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings , was perfectly aware , that , had she known nothing of Darcy , she could have borne the dread of Lydia's infamy somewhat better .	171822.96678189718
her voice was weak , and her manner affected .	402938.22690930456
Would you believe it , Lizzy , that when he went to town last November , he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent , would have prevented his coming down again !	184751.7865609206
he kissed it with affectionate gallantry , though he hardly knew how to look , and they entered the house .	235335.18749647937
The particulars , I reserve till we meet .	448692.4807466969
and she looked on the whole scene , the river , the trees scattered on its banks , and the winding of the valley , as far as she could trace it , with delight .	189236.011448061
It was an animating subject , and Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match .	241439.52775727588
Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ;	229896.54819135778
Neither could any thing be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities which Darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach .	190924.3165773236
She then sought her eldest sister , who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley .	241439.52775727588
From Collins !	2646482.834236289
Will you do me the honour of reading that letter ?	368394.5561233181
So , Lizzy , said he one day , your sister is crossed in love I find .	256190.74520215756
Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately ;	402938.22690930456
There was no want of discourse .	603117.8376712757
His coming into the country at all , is a most insolent thing indeed , and I wonder how he could presume to do it .	213027.94172063502
So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him !	341488.7802649577
and he was obliged to walk about the room , while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences .	220628.02418416445
How well it sounds .	987395.4977649314
It should not be said , that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers .	209720.11926061154
and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself ;	206686.61049801102
They found Bennet still up .	744997.1111468794
and they conversed with so much spirit and flow , as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself , as well as of Darcy .	213027.94172063502
But it is , returned she ;	603117.8376712757
He shook his head .	987395.4977649314
His daughter's request , for such it might be considered , of being admitted into her family again , before she set off for the North , received at first an absolute negative .	192725.47726509365
Stop me whilst you can .	744997.1111468794
Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure , and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming , when she found herself so affectionately received .	209720.11926061154
Is it possible !	1464745.9913903195
Let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ;	235335.18749647937
He delighted in going to Pemberley , especially when he was least expected .	302466.73346396536
I had no notion but he would go a shooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company .	220628.02418416445
Elizabeth was in agonies .	987395.4977649314
Your uncle is as much surprised as I am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned , would have allowed him to act as he has done .	196714.4820734748
This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted : and Elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away .	198930.78305103924
Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to his wife ?	319996.27800304984
On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects .	319996.27800304984
An express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from Colonel Forster , to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers ;	187650.33801142208
This has been my motive , my fair cousin , and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem .	225021.6135296377
You ought certainly to forgive them as a christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing .	201317.51640173607
I will not encourage the impudence of either , by receiving them at Longbourn .	287917.9352426727
The next morning , however , made an alteration ;	402938.22690930456
Charlotte is an excellent manager , I dare say .	402938.22690930456
It is evident by this , added Jane , that he comes back no more this winter .	256190.74520215756
To be sure that did seem as if he admired her indeed I rather believe he did I heard something about it but I hardly know what something about Robinson .	198930.78305103924
With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ;	265208.36875681544
When she remembered the style of his address , she was still full of indignation ;	275663.02399114973
When first Bennet had married , economy was held to be perfectly useless ;	302466.73346396536
The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came , and Bennet was forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle , was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth .	174982.72217245714
can it be really so !	744997.1111468794
She had never seen a place for which nature had done more , or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste .	209720.11926061154
I hope , added Gardiner , that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her .	248337.34193872553
what can have induced him to behave so cruelly ?	402938.22690930456
Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications .	229896.54819135778
His eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity ;	275663.02399114973
As soon as all had ate , and the elder ones paid , the carriage was ordered ;	256190.74520215756
You know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself .	256190.74520215756
Let me hear what it is .	603117.8376712757
He meant , I believe , replied Jane , to go to Epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the postilions , and try if any thing could be made out from them .	186158.26522788222
observed Bennet .	2646482.834236289
and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible .	256190.74520215756
The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic .	319996.27800304984
My overhearings were more to the purpose than yours , Eliza , said Charlotte .	287917.9352426727
his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had .	196714.4820734748
said Elizabeth .	2646482.834236289
The first mentioned was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , I had detached Bingley from your sister , and the other , that I had , in defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , ruined the immediate prosperity , and blasted the prospects of Wickham .	169780.45008779215
Darcy is all politeness , said Elizabeth , smiling .	402938.22690930456
said Jane .	2646482.834236289
It was some days , however , before they received any invitation thither , for while there were visitors in the house , they could not be necessary ;	203894.9364609667
Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth and it was soon done done while Bennet was stirring the fire .	229896.54819135778
I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings , and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three , of whom we shall deprive you .	178778.81272199392
It taught me to hope , said he , as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before .	241439.52775727588
but since then , we have both , I hope , improved in civility .	287917.9352426727
but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him .	198930.78305103924
When Jane and Elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in her praise of Bingley before , expressed to her sister how very much she admired him .	196714.4820734748
There can be no love in all this .	448692.4807466969
Yet it is hard , she sometimes thought , that this poor man cannot come to a house , which he has legally hired , without raising all this speculation !	198930.78305103924
and Bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice .	319996.27800304984
Good heavens !	2646482.834236289
If I had been able , said she , to carry my point of going to Brighton , with all my family , this would not have happened ;	203894.9364609667
Indeed I had .	1464745.9913903195
and in the mean time , she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married , to Hill and the two housemaids .	209720.11926061154
Lydia's being settled in the North , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment ;	182167.88622491734
The younger ones out before the elder are married !	402938.22690930456
My excellent father died about five years ago ;	448692.4807466969
We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening , said Elizabeth .	256190.74520215756
And if you will stay another month complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London , for I am going there early in June , for a week ;	186158.26522788222
Lizzy , you must not do so .	511728.00322052115
Only look at her .	987395.4977649314
and the Hursts have no horses to theirs .	448692.4807466969
She directly replied , You need not be frightened .	402938.22690930456
How nicely we are crammed in !	603117.8376712757
The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning's impatience .	302466.73346396536

Lizzy , when you first read that letter , I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now .	225021.6135296377
but her's she thought was still worse .	511728.00322052115
and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty .	368394.5561233181
But does Lydia know nothing of this ?	511728.00322052115
She counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent ;	302466.73346396536
Can such abominable pride as his , have ever done him good ?	319996.27800304984
Oh !	7093278.638358481
Good Heaven !	2646482.834236289
Have all her friends left her ?	603117.8376712757
Their brother , indeed , was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency .	241439.52775727588
The colour which had been driven from her face , returned for half a minute with an additional glow , and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes , as she thought for that space of time , that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken .	173333.70311129894
Pardon me .	2646482.834236289
My dear , dear Lizzy , I would I do congratulate you but are you certain ?	265208.36875681544
Her father had been an attorney in Meryton , and had left her four thousand pounds .	265208.36875681544
She had fully proposed being engaged by Wickham for those very dances : and to have Collins instead !	248337.34193872553
I am so grieved for him .	603117.8376712757
She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together .	241439.52775727588
no , I certainly am not .	603117.8376712757
You quite mistook Darcy .	987395.4977649314
but this is the true one .	603117.8376712757
Yes , in conjunction with his friend .	511728.00322052115
and still different from either , was what Bennet sent to Collins , in reply to his last .	248337.34193872553
Bingley was every thing that was charming , except the professed lover of her daughter .	275663.02399114973
They repulsed every attempt of Bennet at conversation , and by so doing , threw a languor over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Collins , who was complimenting Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests .	165841.40473717582
As all conversation was thereby at an end , Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room .	275663.02399114973
Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject ;	368394.5561233181
When first he came in , he had spoken to her but little ;	302466.73346396536
If it is designedly done , they cannot be justified ;	368394.5561233181
But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both .	162369.09402314786
and , as they drew near the appointed inn where Bennet's carriage was to meet them , they quickly perceived , in token of the coachman's punctuality , both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs .	183423.77927519934
What , none of you ?	744997.1111468794
Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman , and required information ;	265208.36875681544
Well , my comfort is , I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done .	203894.9364609667
Too much , I am afraid ;	603117.8376712757
This was very amiable , but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any conception of ;	265208.36875681544
His family knew him to be on all common occasions , a most negligent and dilatory correspondent , but at such a time , they had hoped for exertion .	201317.51640173607
His first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance , as far as it would go .	174139.77156307746
She wanted to talk , but there seemed an embargo on every subject .	302466.73346396536
In every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived .	287917.9352426727
but on perceiving Darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner .	229896.54819135778
She was more alive to the disgrace , which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham , a fortnight before they took place .	180978.41605940924
and Gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in London the very next day , and would assist Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia .	182167.88622491734
And then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you ;	248337.34193872553
As for Elizabeth , her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last ;	275663.02399114973
They are not married , nor can I find there was any intention of being so ;	265208.36875681544
for you are really proud of your defects in writing , because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution , which if not estimable , you think at least highly interesting .	184751.7865609206
You never will be able to make both of them good for any thing .	287917.9352426727
They walked towards the Lucases , because Kitty wished to call upon Maria ;	302466.73346396536
But you see that Jane , said her aunt , does not think so ill of Wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt .	209720.11926061154
I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ;	302466.73346396536
it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it .	275663.02399114973
The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend , assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London , might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment .	180978.41605940924
She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either , or make either appear to advantage .	241439.52775727588
You allude perhaps to the entail of this estate .	402938.22690930456
She could not win him , however , to any conversation ;	341488.7802649577
by her ease and liveliness , his mind might have been softened , his manners improved , and from his judgment , information , and knowledge of the world , she must have received benefit of greater importance .	184751.7865609206
Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone .	319996.27800304984
I enquired after their brother , of course .	448692.4807466969
Bennet could hardly comprehend it .	744997.1111468794
and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both .	248337.34193872553
Dear me !	2646482.834236289
by reason , by reflection , by every thing .	402938.22690930456
to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed , and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation , console herself for the present , and prepare for another disappointment .	189236.011448061
During dinner , Bennet scarcely spoke at all ;	448692.4807466969
To convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself , was no very difficult point .	256190.74520215756
my daughters are brought up differently .	603117.8376712757
and after listening a moment , she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry , and calling loudly after her .	225021.6135296377
Why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent , said she , did he come at all ?	220628.02418416445
I do think it is the hardest thing in the world , that your estate should be entailed away from your own children ;	220628.02418416445
Bennet treasured up the hint , and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married ;	265208.36875681544
Do you know Bingley ?	987395.4977649314
Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy .	368394.5561233181
and very unwillingly said so .	744997.1111468794
Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter ;	198930.78305103924
Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not .	256190.74520215756
He had been some time with Gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river , and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning .	175865.13501774057
He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies , of whose beauty he had heard much ;	225021.6135296377
Good God !	2646482.834236289
Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever .	213027.94172063502
Something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them , but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life .	201317.51640173607
it came from Netherfield , and was opened immediately .	402938.22690930456
They have each their advantages , and I can be equally happy in either .	287917.9352426727
She was wild to be at home to hear , to see , to be upon the spot , to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her , in a family so deranged ;	183423.77927519934
In making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self-reproach .	189236.011448061
CHAPTER I Elizabeth , as they drove along , watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation ;	235335.18749647937
Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance ;	341488.7802649577
And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton , of whom I shall subjoin a list , according to his information .	201317.51640173607
But make a virtue of it by all means .	402938.22690930456
Arguments are too much like disputes .	603117.8376712757
I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , Lizzy ?	319996.27800304984
The rest of the evening passed with the appearance , on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no farther attempt to distinguish Elizabeth ;	209720.11926061154
I believe , Ma'am , I may safely promise you never to dance with him .	275663.02399114973
No , no .	1464745.9913903195
and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least .	319996.27800304984
At length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself .	203894.9364609667
She followed him with her eyes , envied every one to whom he spoke , had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee ;	216648.58268882733
I never saw such a long chin in my life .	368394.5561233181
I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield .	287917.9352426727
cried Elizabeth ;	2646482.834236289
but this was all lost upon me .	511728.00322052115
No , Kitty , I have at last learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it .	229896.54819135778
The principal purport of his letter was to inform them , that Wickham had resolved on quitting the Militia .	241439.52775727588
I shall be very fit to see Jane which is all I want .	302466.73346396536
When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford , every eye was in search of the Parsonage , and every turning expected to bring it in view .	198930.78305103924
her complexion has no brilliancy ;	744997.1111468794
said her mother as soon as she was in the hall .	341488.7802649577
They will join me early to-morrow , he continued , and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you , Bingley and his sisters .	206686.61049801102
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity .	341488.7802649577
I do not mind his not talking to Long , said Miss Lucas , but I wish he had danced with Eliza .	225021.6135296377
but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder .	341488.7802649577
Yes , there can ;	987395.4977649314
If you received the work electronically , the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund .	192725.47726509365
Make haste , make haste .	744997.1111468794
My reasons for believing it are briefly these : It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance , or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable .	186158.26522788222
After amusing himself some time with their curiosity , he thus explained .	319996.27800304984
I had not believed it possible .	603117.8376712757
Forgive me ;	2646482.834236289
This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself .	341488.7802649577
Darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say something indistinctly of his concern , and observe her in compassionate silence .	229896.54819135778
At length there was nothing more to be said ;	402938.22690930456
Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ;	287917.9352426727
She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room .	302466.73346396536
But at least it shews , that she was serious in the object of her journey .	265208.36875681544
but , exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone .	229896.54819135778
Elizabeth quietly answered Undoubtedly ;	987395.4977649314
Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic ;	511728.00322052115
You must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course .	216648.58268882733
I can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ;	275663.02399114973
Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming .	448692.4807466969
I dare say she will ;	744997.1111468794
But self , though it would intrude , could not engross her .	319996.27800304984
His temptation is not adequate to the risk .	448692.4807466969
a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point , without being resented .	275663.02399114973
Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal from the shire , as clearly as Gardiner could do .	229896.54819135778
To Bennet's acknowledgments he briefly replied , with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family ;	229896.54819135778
When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned , in terms of such mortifying , yet merited reproach , her sense of shame was severe .	194651.1126567522
He is now gone into the army , she added , but I am afraid he has turned out very wild .	229896.54819135778
and , after giving each of them an hasty kiss , hurried into the vestibule , where Jane , who came running down stairs from her mother's apartment , immediately met her .	194651.1126567522
Take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one .	319996.27800304984
I am most seriously displeased .	744997.1111468794
When they ascended the steps to the hall , Maria's alarm was every moment increasing , and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm .	213027.94172063502
My feelings will not be repressed .	603117.8376712757
Nor was Darcy's vindication , though grateful to her feelings , capable of consoling her for such discovery .	248337.34193872553
All that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds , secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ;	184751.7865609206
My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other .	368394.5561233181
She has known him only a fortnight .	511728.00322052115
I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being .	196714.4820734748
and Elizabeth , as they waited for the housekeeper , had leisure to wonder at her being where she was .	235335.18749647937
Elizabeth , though expecting no less , thanked him with tears of gratitude ;	302466.73346396536
I am sick of them all .	603117.8376712757
You shall not , for the sake of one individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that selfishness is prudence , and insensibility of danger , security for happiness .	182167.88622491734
Elizabeth now began to revive .	744997.1111468794
She received him with her very best politeness , which he returned with as much more , apologising for his intrusion , without any previous acquaintance with her , which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice .	170433.8703022177
Very nonsensical to come at all !	603117.8376712757
Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to identify , do copyright research on , transcribe and proofread public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm collection .	203894.9364609667
From that moment I observed my friend's behaviour attentively ;	402938.22690930456
One enjoyment was certain that of suitableness as companions ;	402938.22690930456
And if I am that choice , why may not I accept him ?	302466.73346396536
D The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you can do with this work .	235335.18749647937
Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival , that Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine ;	157973.38177336231
Elizabeth smiled .	2646482.834236289
Such doings discomposed Bennet exceedingly .	744997.1111468794
My sister , who is more than ten years my junior , was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew , Colonel Fitzwilliam , and myself .	206686.61049801102
It suddenly struck her that it might be from lady Catherine ;	341488.7802649577
E8 .	7093278.638358481
Let Wickham be your man .	744997.1111468794
She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it .	209720.11926061154
At last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance of Darcy , with such a smile over the face , as she remembered to have sometimes seen , when he looked at her .	189236.011448061
and whenever they changed their quarters , either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to , for some little assistance towards discharging their bills .	209720.11926061154
But I must write no more .	603117.8376712757
and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation .	275663.02399114973
Write to me very often , my dear .	448692.4807466969
She could see him instantly before her , in every charm of air and address ;	275663.02399114973
But , really , I know not what to say .	368394.5561233181
and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it , to Ramsgate ;	275663.02399114973
His plan did not vary on seeing them .	448692.4807466969
Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ?	368394.5561233181
just enough to make one good sort of man ;	402938.22690930456
and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been ;	302466.73346396536
Poor Jane !	2646482.834236289
The more I see of the world , the more am I dissatisfied with it ;	275663.02399114973
He and his sisters were well , I hope , when you left London .	287917.9352426727
International donations are gratefully accepted , but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States .	220628.02418416445
CHAPTER III .	2646482.834236289
Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect , that the sight of such rooms , so many servants , and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them .	192725.47726509365
Don't keep coughing so , Kitty , for heaven's sake !	368394.5561233181
Under such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief .	241439.52775727588
and at that moment she felt , that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something !	265208.36875681544
Lord , how ashamed I should be of not being married before three and twenty !	275663.02399114973
She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure .	341488.7802649577
nor could she for many hours , learn to think of it less than incessantly .	275663.02399114973
You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness ;	265208.36875681544
His consenting to marry her is a proof , I will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking .	220628.02418416445
To-morrow fortnight .	2646482.834236289
but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other , of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that Denny had brought him from London , and that he was to have a lieutenant's commission in the shire .	168548.0778683641
It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way .	265208.36875681544
My youngest of all , is lately married , and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds , walking with a young man , who I believe will soon become a part of the family .	189236.011448061
They were then , with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance , taken into the house ;	225021.6135296377
But Elizabeth , who had not the least inclination to remain with them , laughingly answered , No , no ;	235335.18749647937
and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement .	368394.5561233181
All field sports were over .	744997.1111468794
My style of writing is very different from yours .	402938.22690930456
c .	7093278.638358481
and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror , Gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power .	248337.34193872553
Thus , we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition .	275663.02399114973
She wrote even to Jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her former professions of regard .	225021.6135296377
CHAPTER X The day passed much as the day before had done .	319996.27800304984
He merely added , that he should not write again , till he had something of importance to mention .	241439.52775727588
It originated in Gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support , and consequently preferred her husband's .	203894.9364609667
After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with It is your turn to say something now , Darcy .	220628.02418416445
and his commendation of every thing would have touched Bennet's heart , but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property .	206686.61049801102
She comes to us to-day .	744997.1111468794
I will not tell you what it is .	448692.4807466969
At length however Bennet had no more to say ;	402938.22690930456
The power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor , and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance .	206686.61049801102
Then turning to Bennet , he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon .	302466.73346396536
The subjection in which his father had brought him up , had given him originally great humility of manner , but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head , living in retirement , and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity .	173333.70311129894
From the entrance hall , of which Collins pointed out , with a rapturous air , the fine proportion and finished ornaments , they followed the servants through an anti-chamber , to the room where Lady Catherine , her daughter , and Jenkinson were sitting .	176789.83562996527
and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over .	275663.02399114973
Now , said she , that this first meeting is over , I feel perfectly easy .	265208.36875681544
The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited .	341488.7802649577
After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight , and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear ;	209720.11926061154
What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy ?	448692.4807466969
Lydia was exceedingly fond of him .	603117.8376712757
When coffee was over , Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him ;	265208.36875681544
I do not believe she often sees such at home .	368394.5561233181
A clergyman like you must marry .	603117.8376712757
But gracious me !	1464745.9913903195
It was agreed to .	987395.4977649314
But she would not be secure .	603117.8376712757
Though I shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ;	319996.27800304984
You are so strange !	987395.4977649314
Having resolved to do it without loss of time , as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday , and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment , he set about it in a very orderly manner , with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business .	165355.49382471753
E GARDINER .	2646482.834236289
For my own part , she rejoined , I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her .	235335.18749647937
and in the evening Bennet's invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter .	235335.18749647937
Yes , always , she replied , without knowing what she said , for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , I remember hearing you once say , Darcy , that you hardly ever forgave , that your resentment once created was unappeasable .	169780.45008779215
my sweetest Lizzy !	1464745.9913903195
And I think you will agree with me , in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece's .	206686.61049801102
Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations ;	368394.5561233181
CHAPTER XVIII .	2646482.834236289
F6 .	7093278.638358481
that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her , and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening .	198930.78305103924
CHAPTER III .	2646482.834236289
What a charming amusement for young people this is , Darcy !	341488.7802649577
I remember , as soon as ever I saw him , when he first came into Hertfordshire last year , I thought how likely it was that you should come together .	196714.4820734748
But it is all , all too late now .	402938.22690930456
and Bennet found , with amazement and horror , that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter .	220628.02418416445
She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse , but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other , and how formal and cold was their manner , whenever they did .	187650.33801142208
No one who has ever seen you together , can doubt his affection .	302466.73346396536
Elizabeth listened as little as she could , but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name .	241439.52775727588
that it should be equally unreserved was impossible .	448692.4807466969
It is because he will not give himself the trouble .	368394.5561233181
Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself , and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam , Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word I say .	186158.26522788222
He is perfectly well behaved , polite , and unassuming , said her uncle .	287917.9352426727
You have reduced him to his present state of poverty , comparative poverty .	302466.73346396536
Nearly three weeks .	1464745.9913903195
Oh !	7093278.638358481
His appearance was greatly in his favour ;	511728.00322052115
I have sent for you on an affair of importance .	368394.5561233181
When to these recollections was added the developement of Wickham's character , it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before , were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful .	176789.83562996527
but Ashworth is too far off !	603117.8376712757
She now lost every expectation of pleasure .	511728.00322052115
Miss Bennet , replied her ladyship , in an angry tone , you ought to know , that I am not to be trifled with .	213027.94172063502
for I consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman .	241439.52775727588
On reaching the spacious lobby above , they were shewn into a very pretty sitting-room , lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below ;	203894.9364609667
You know pretty well , I suppose , what has been done for the young people .	265208.36875681544
At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted .	341488.7802649577
I never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong .	275663.02399114973
Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible .	368394.5561233181
Elizabeth silently attended her .	987395.4977649314
Oh , Jane , take care .	603117.8376712757
Oh !	7093278.638358481
' But afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time .	229896.54819135778
She examined into their employments , looked at their work , and advised them to do it differently ;	248337.34193872553
CHAPTER XI .	2646482.834236289
unless you looked up to him as a superior .	402938.22690930456
I have therefore made up my mind to tell you , that I do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare .	201317.51640173607
and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William , in which she was readily joined by Jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of Collins , and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London .	163567.1467053596
Who do you mean , my dear ?	511728.00322052115
Though Bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage .	198930.78305103924
how can it affect them ?	744997.1111468794
They had nothing to accuse him of but pride ;	402938.22690930456
He was coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland : when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey .	183423.77927519934
Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game , except when Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh's being too hot or too cold , or having too much or too little light .	184751.7865609206
but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future .	265208.36875681544

He scarcely ever spoke to her , and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself , were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas , whose civility in listening to him , was a seasonable relief to them all , and especially to her friend .	171114.14759065388
CHAPTER VIII .	2646482.834236289
When at length they arose to take leave , Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn ;	213027.94172063502
I could see him with perfect indifference , but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of .	235335.18749647937
I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes .	511728.00322052115
and the two , who were most anxiously expected , to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen , were in very good time .	216648.58268882733
No one but Bennet , regretted that their stay would be so short ;	302466.73346396536
Lydia has no brothers to step forward ;	511728.00322052115
CHAPTER XII .	2646482.834236289
Well , mamma , said she , when they were all returned to the breakfast room , and what do you think of my husband ?	213027.94172063502
'Tis as good as a Lord !	603117.8376712757
forgive the question are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ?	287917.9352426727
and therefore gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent , his actions were capable of a very different construction ;	186158.26522788222
But what is that to me ?	603117.8376712757
a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade .	229896.54819135778
To fortune I am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since I am well aware that it could not be complied with ;	196714.4820734748
Girls , can I do any thing for you in Meryton ?	341488.7802649577
[ Illustration : Morning Dress .	744997.1111468794
But the wife of Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation , that she could , upon the whole , have no cause to repine .	196714.4820734748
Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table , and they went up stairs together .	275663.02399114973
Your alliance will be a disgrace ;	603117.8376712757
I have every reason in the world to think ill of you .	319996.27800304984
Elizabeth immediately recognising the livery , guessed what it meant , and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations , by acquainting them with the honour which she expected .	196714.4820734748
At present , indeed , they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood ;	213027.94172063502
The world has been deceived in that respect ;	448692.4807466969
Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility ;	402938.22690930456
He must write his own sermons ;	603117.8376712757
which will not be yours till after your mother's decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to .	235335.18749647937
She stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation , and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery .	229896.54819135778
Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ?	235335.18749647937
Miss Darcy's praise occupied the chief of it .	448692.4807466969
Recovering himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said , Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of .	203894.9364609667
Is her husband , is the son of his late father's steward , to be his brother ?	256190.74520215756
Lady Catherine approached , and , after listening for a few minutes , said to Darcy , Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss , if she practised more , and could have the advantage of a London master .	182167.88622491734
but Sir William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane , who were dancing together .	194651.1126567522
How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell , but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you .	213027.94172063502
Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother .	511728.00322052115
Certainly , replied Elizabeth there are such people , but I hope I am not one of them .	248337.34193872553
See paragraph 1 .	1464745.9913903195
I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did .	265208.36875681544
Had his own happiness , however , been the only sacrifice , he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best ;	203894.9364609667
And with a bow to Darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room .	209720.11926061154
She would not betray her trust , I suppose , without bribery and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be found .	206686.61049801102
but they were now necessary , and she assured him with some confusion , of her attachment to Darcy .	241439.52775727588
All was acknowledged , and half the night spent in conversation .	341488.7802649577
If we are ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been , said Elizabeth , and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what Gardiner has done for them , because Wickham has not sixpence of his own .	174982.72217245714
Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father .	368394.5561233181
Hunsford , near Westerham , Kent , 15th October .	402938.22690930456
Bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from London , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time .	183423.77927519934
and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life .	216648.58268882733
I would keep a pack of foxhounds , and drink a bottle of wine every day .	265208.36875681544
Now , seriously , what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence ?	302466.73346396536
and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to elope with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ;	186158.26522788222
Must it be so ?	987395.4977649314
These bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had I with greater policy concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified , unalloyed inclination ;	194651.1126567522
I hope she will turn out well .	511728.00322052115
Teaze him laugh at him .	744997.1111468794
She danced four dances with him at Meryton ;	448692.4807466969
While the contents of the first letter remained on her mind , she was all surprise all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl , whom it was impossible he could marry for money ;	190924.3165773236
Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start , and before he could recover himself enough to speak , she , in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's situation , hastily exclaimed , I beg your pardon , but I must leave you .	175865.13501774057
I know not , Miss Elizabeth , said he , whether Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us , but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it .	179850.2585926096
And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection .	229896.54819135778
Any place would do , of about three or four hundred a year ;	302466.73346396536
The note was immediately dispatched , and its contents as quickly complied with .	302466.73346396536
and when it closed , Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon Charlotte's degree of contentment , to understand her address in guiding , and composure in bearing with her husband , and to acknowledge that it was all done very well .	175865.13501774057
But no letter appeared , and she was completely puzzled .	368394.5561233181
This was a lucky idea of mine , indeed !	402938.22690930456
but it is not sound .	744997.1111468794
What is his name ?	987395.4977649314
Reynolds , either from pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister .	235335.18749647937
Her look and manners were open , cheerful and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and I remained convinced from the evening's scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment .	173333.70311129894
Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer , and forced his younger sister to be civil also , and say what the occasion required .	216648.58268882733
Every thing that is charming !	744997.1111468794
and after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do , which was the more probable from the time of year .	189236.011448061
Brother-in-law of Wickham !	1464745.9913903195
Happy shall I be , when his stay at Netherfield is over !	319996.27800304984
Miss Darcy was tall , and on a larger scale than Elizabeth ;	319996.27800304984
At present we have nothing to guide us .	448692.4807466969
The account of his connection with the Pemberley family , was exactly what he had related himself ;	256190.74520215756
Your sisters are engaged , and there is not another woman in the room , whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with .	203894.9364609667
When I wrote that letter , replied Darcy , I believed myself perfectly calm and cool , but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit .	194651.1126567522
The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth , as the first .	256190.74520215756
We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Wickham with money .	302466.73346396536
As soon as they had driven from the door , Elizabeth was called on by her cousin , to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings , which , for Charlotte's sake , she made more favourable than it really was .	176789.83562996527
They may wish many things besides his happiness ;	448692.4807466969
I must conclude , for I cannot be long from my poor mother .	302466.73346396536
cried Elizabeth , brightening up for a moment .	448692.4807466969
But however he did not .	744997.1111468794
Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Hurst or Miss Bingley ;	319996.27800304984
Your friend performs delightfully ;	987395.4977649314
and the valley , here contracted into a glen , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it .	203894.9364609667
They could talk of nothing but officers ;	511728.00322052115
Their conduct has been such , replied Elizabeth , as neither you , nor I , nor any body , can ever forget .	220628.02418416445
She had obtained private intelligence that Darcy did not wish for cards ;	319996.27800304984
why is not every body as happy ?	511728.00322052115
nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable .	368394.5561233181
He had never before supposed that , could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter , it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself , as by the present arrangement .	192725.47726509365
Kitty stared at him , and Lydia exclaimed .	448692.4807466969
Elizabeth could not help saying , It is very much to his credit , I am sure , that you should think so .	220628.02418416445
On their being joined by Bingley himself , Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas ;	302466.73346396536
Wickham passed all his youth there , you know .	402938.22690930456
As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , I shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females .	182167.88622491734
Very little was said by either ;	603117.8376712757
repeated Elizabeth , in utter amazement .	603117.8376712757
her liveliness had been never worse timed .	511728.00322052115
Perhaps it will be as well , if you discourage his coming here so very often .	265208.36875681544
CHAPTER V Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate .	248337.34193872553
She retreated from the window , fearful of being seen ;	368394.5561233181
he sustained it however with fortitude , and so far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into conversation with Gardiner .	213027.94172063502
She shared in their attendance on Bennet , and was a great comfort to them , in their hours of freedom .	229896.54819135778
Does he know his real character ?	603117.8376712757
In her kind schemes for Elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam .	287917.9352426727
We shall often meet , I hope , in Hertfordshire .	368394.5561233181
replied Kitty , it looks just like that man that used to be with him before .	265208.36875681544
If you were to give me forty such men , I never could be so happy as you .	248337.34193872553
She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious , made no other reply to Elizabeth's salutation , than a slight inclination of the head , and sat down without saying a word .	189236.011448061
He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever , on the occasion .	256190.74520215756
What is to become of us !	603117.8376712757
It was kindly meant .	987395.4977649314
Lydia declared herself satisfied .	987395.4977649314
My sister , I am sure , will not hear of her removal .	302466.73346396536
The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities , though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings ;	203894.9364609667
If it was not for the entail I should not mind it .	319996.27800304984
And then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it .	248337.34193872553
They have some of the finest woods in the country .	368394.5561233181
Oh !	7093278.638358481
What did you say of me , that I did not deserve ?	319996.27800304984
You forget that I have made no answer .	448692.4807466969
Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility .	287917.9352426727
Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied , Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully .	235335.18749647937
I know not what to think .	603117.8376712757
Bennet could not give her consent , or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , though she talked to Bingley of nothing else , for half an hour ;	192725.47726509365
She knew not what to think , nor how to account for it .	302466.73346396536
So much the better .	987395.4977649314
You wanted me , I know , to say 'Yes , ' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste ;	225021.6135296377
It is admirable !	1464745.9913903195
They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which I cannot wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects .	201317.51640173607
pride he probably had , and if not , it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town , where the family did not visit .	203894.9364609667
But , Lizzy , you can tell us whether it is like or not .	287917.9352426727
and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's dying an old maid .	287917.9352426727
The wisest and the best of men , nay , the wisest and best of their actions , may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke .	192725.47726509365
Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper ;	341488.7802649577
and it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning , and never said a word about it till now .	206686.61049801102
After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room , from the sideboard to the fender , to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London , Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden , which was large and well laid out , and to the cultivation of which he attended himself .	163992.44886988527
I should infinitely prefer a book .	603117.8376712757
but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless Darcy returned within the stated time .	220628.02418416445
This is not to be borne .	603117.8376712757
Had his first appearance , or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining , been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Darcy , the gardener's expression of surprise , on beholding his master , must immediately have told it .	175865.13501774057
Hurst had therefore nothing to do , but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep .	235335.18749647937
I thought it would never be over ;	511728.00322052115
But if I do not take your likeness now , I may never have another opportunity .	265208.36875681544
Elizabeth made no answer , and walked on , her heart swelling with indignation .	287917.9352426727
And do you like her ?	744997.1111468794
It was an evening of no common delight to them all ;	341488.7802649577
I never can be thankful , Bennet , for any thing about the entail .	287917.9352426727
Were the same fair prospect to arise at present , as had flattered them a year ago , every thing , she was persuaded , would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion .	192725.47726509365
He danced only four dances !	744997.1111468794
I have not a doubt of Bingley's sincerity , said Elizabeth warmly ;	319996.27800304984
Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother , on his approaching marriage , were all that was affectionate and insincere .	241439.52775727588
Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort .	341488.7802649577
He likes to have his own way very well , replied Colonel Fitzwilliam .	302466.73346396536
It was painful , exceedingly painful , to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return .	220628.02418416445
Yes , thought Elizabeth , that would be a delightful scheme , indeed , and completely do for us at once .	229896.54819135778
but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off .	319996.27800304984
said he hastily , as he opened the door .	402938.22690930456
She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own , but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action , she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage .	182167.88622491734
As often as I can .	744997.1111468794
If you love Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham , you must be very happy .	241439.52775727588
She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas .	448692.4807466969
Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming , without changing colour .	275663.02399114973
1 .	7093278.638358481
You may depend on it , replied the other , for Nicholls was in Meryton last night ;	256190.74520215756
and she could hardly suppress a smile , at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had revolted , in his offer to herself .	190924.3165773236
I told Collins so before you came .	511728.00322052115
I knew , said he , that what I wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary .	241439.52775727588
Why did not you seek legal redress ?	511728.00322052115
When they repaired to the dining-room , Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place , which , in all their former parties , had belonged to him , by her sister .	189236.011448061
It was necessary to laugh , when she would rather have cried .	319996.27800304984
Soon after you left me on Saturday , I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were .	225021.6135296377
but I always speak what I think .	511728.00322052115
And rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had not Collins thus addressed her , When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ;	172562.15617808924
But that is nothing to us .	603117.8376712757
Our distress , my dear Lizzy , is very great .	368394.5561233181
Not that I mean to find fault with you , for such things I know are all chance in this world .	229896.54819135778
I never saw such capacity , and taste , and application , and elegance , as you describe , united .	235335.18749647937
the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice .	302466.73346396536
found fault with the arrangement of the furniture , or detected the housemaid in negligence ;	275663.02399114973
How can you contrive to write so even ?	448692.4807466969
that my dear mother had more command over herself ;	402938.22690930456
The two first dances , however , brought a return of distress ;	319996.27800304984
The room in which the ladies sat was backwards .	402938.22690930456
My father's opinion of me does me the greatest honour ;	368394.5561233181
It may be easily believed , that however little of novelty could be added to their fears , hopes , and conjectures , on this interesting subject , by its repeated discussion , no other could detain them from it long , during the whole of the journey .	174139.77156307746
but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption !	287917.9352426727
The coach , therefore , took them the first stage of their journey , and brought its master back to Longbourn .	229896.54819135778
cried Jane , what do you mean , Sir ?	402938.22690930456
for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Darcy's steward , and of that , I can assure you , he informed me himself .	194651.1126567522
Her figure was elegant , and she walked well ;	402938.22690930456
I have faults enough , but they are not , I hope , of understanding .	275663.02399114973
but she could not approve him ;	603117.8376712757
and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so full of contradictions and varieties , sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance , and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination .	177759.9247841244
Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections ?	319996.27800304984
CHAPTER I It is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune , must be in want of a wife .	206686.61049801102
I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then Georgiana , unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me .	178778.81272199392
It is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married , continued her mother , but at the same time , Bingley , it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me .	179850.2585926096
And in the first place , let us hear what has happened to you all , since you went away .	235335.18749647937
Besides , it will not much signify what one wears this summer , after the shire have left Meryton , and they are going in a fortnight .	206686.61049801102
His debts are to be paid , amounting , I believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her , and his commission purchased .	189236.011448061
He dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday .	248337.34193872553
Her mother's ungraciousness , made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind ;	256190.74520215756
But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes .	179850.2585926096
You are rather disposed to call his interference officious ?	402938.22690930456
and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go , she did not seem to ask for compassion .	241439.52775727588
Whilst wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and Elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of Darcy approaching them , and at no great distance .	182167.88622491734
At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here .	248337.34193872553
and it was but the other day , that I recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her .	196714.4820734748
We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side , said Jane : I hope and trust they will yet be happy .	213027.94172063502
that she had a new gown , or a new parasol , which she would have described more fully , but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry , as Forster called her , and they were going to the camp ;	178778.81272199392
If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement , I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one .	187650.33801142208
And pray may I ask ?	744997.1111468794
I should never be happy without him , so think it no harm to be off .	265208.36875681544
have you heard from my uncle ?	603117.8376712757
He repeated the question , with some surprise at her silence .	341488.7802649577
and a report soon followed that Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly .	235335.18749647937
for she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening , although utterly unknown to her before .	194651.1126567522
and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry her , had she been his relation .	187650.33801142208
As for your Elizabeth's picture , you must not attempt to have it taken , for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes ?	213027.94172063502
It would have suited me in every respect .	448692.4807466969
He immediately offered to fetch her others ;	511728.00322052115
I ought not to have said a word about it .	368394.5561233181
His father was an excellent man , said Gardiner .	402938.22690930456
One ought not to repine ;	744997.1111468794
I cannot catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as I often see done .	235335.18749647937
She was not sorry , however , to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung .	216648.58268882733
the other is Charlotte's marriage .	744997.1111468794
But you How are you ?	744997.1111468794
He danced only four dances , though gentlemen were scarce ;	368394.5561233181
Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ;	220628.02418416445
Good gracious !	2646482.834236289
I am more likely to want time than courage , Elizabeth .	341488.7802649577
And though he exclaimed at the term , she found that it had been pretty much the case .	248337.34193872553
and continually was she repeating , Why is he so altered ?	341488.7802649577
You may well warn me against such an evil .	402938.22690930456
They were of course all intending to be surprised ;	402938.22690930456
my head is always full of something else .	448692.4807466969
She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an inmate of Darcy's house , and mentioned with raptures , some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture .	196714.4820734748
This however was no evil to Elizabeth , and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough ;	248337.34193872553
He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before , on his reading Collins's letter ;	275663.02399114973
Jane , cried Elizabeth , was there a servant belonging to it , who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ?	209720.11926061154
They travelled as expeditiously as possible ;	603117.8376712757
You are a very strange creature by way of a friend !	341488.7802649577
When Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed , which certainly was not unseldom , she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte .	206686.61049801102
The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity ;	172562.15617808924
Your tempers are by no means unlike .	511728.00322052115
and , after receiving her answer , asked in an hesitating manner how long Darcy had been staying there .	241439.52775727588
His being so sure of succeeding , was wrong , said she ;	319996.27800304984
Allow me to say , Lady Catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application , have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged .	201317.51640173607
GARDINER .	7093278.638358481
and before he went away , an engagement was formed , chiefly through his own and Bennet's means , for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband .	201317.51640173607
you cannot go yourself .	987395.4977649314
That Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham , before his arrival , but without gaining any satisfactory information ;	241439.52775727588
They were in fact very fine ladies ;	511728.00322052115
Well , any friend of Bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure ;	287917.9352426727
Come , let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly .	241439.52775727588
I am , dear Sir , c .	511728.00322052115
or , as the happiest alternative , been secluded from the world , in some distant farm house .	248337.34193872553
And how impossible in others !	744997.1111468794
but of the truth of what I shall relate , I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity .	235335.18749647937
Nay , if you are so serious about it , I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled .	248337.34193872553
Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity , a warmth , a delight , which words could but poorly express .	235335.18749647937
At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ;	216648.58268882733
but from what the report of their engagement could originate , Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ;	248337.34193872553
my dear brother , replied Bennet , that is exactly what I could most wish for .	265208.36875681544
Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude , but said nothing .	319996.27800304984
it is very hard to think that she might have been Collins's wife by this time , had not it been for her own perverseness .	213027.94172063502
He could not speak a word for full ten minutes .	368394.5561233181
If this be the case , he deserves you .	402938.22690930456
His attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect ;	402938.22690930456
It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast ;	341488.7802649577
I am sure you will be very comfortable there .	402938.22690930456
At length the Parsonage was discernible .	603117.8376712757
so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as your's seems to have been .	287917.9352426727
I am afraid you will be angry .	511728.00322052115
He certainly looked at her friend a great deal , but the expression of that look was disputable .	248337.34193872553
She was less handsome than her brother , but there was sense and good humour in her face , and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle .	206686.61049801102
London : Printed for T Egerton , Military Library , Whitehall .	341488.7802649577
and she parted from him convinced , that whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing .	216648.58268882733
I often tell my other girls they are nothing to her .	341488.7802649577
Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction and a moment's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible , she sat down again , and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion .	170433.8703022177
I am not afraid of you , said he , smilingly .	341488.7802649577
I do not think it is very pretty ;	448692.4807466969
Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he ?	287917.9352426727
1 .	7093278.638358481
but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing , and between herself and Elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to .	216648.58268882733
MY DEAR NIECE , I have just received your letter , and shall devote this whole morning to answering it , as I foresee that a little writing will not comprise what I have to tell you .	186158.26522788222
and , though Kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense , since the disturbers of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended , was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance , by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp .	165355.49382471753
That is capital , added her sister , and they both laughed heartily .	302466.73346396536
Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer , as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces .	209720.11926061154
The girls grieved over such a number of ladies ;	402938.22690930456
said Elizabeth .	2646482.834236289
Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity , are not worth a regret .	241439.52775727588
It is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and interest , for him to be guilty of it .	225021.6135296377
What a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago , would now have been gladly and gratefully received !	189236.011448061
and I understand from Gardiner , that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all , before she leaves the South .	225021.6135296377
said that she had liked him better when they met in Kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning .	206686.61049801102
We are speaking of music , Madam , said he , when no longer able to avoid a reply .	241439.52775727588
and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you .	275663.02399114973
They are descended on the maternal side , from the same noble line ;	302466.73346396536
And is this all ?	987395.4977649314
They have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression .	265208.36875681544
The boy protested that she should not ;	511728.00322052115
Bennet accepted the challenge , observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements .	235335.18749647937
They have at least that advantage .	603117.8376712757
It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge ;	275663.02399114973
My father began life in the profession which your uncle , Philips , appears to do so much credit to but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late Darcy , and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property .	174982.72217245714
That will not do for a compliment to Darcy , Caroline , cried her brother because he does not write with ease .	225021.6135296377
Adieu .	7093278.638358481
you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner .	402938.22690930456
but intricate characters are the most amusing .	511728.00322052115
grieved shocked .	2646482.834236289
This , she would not hear of ;	511728.00322052115
It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity ;	275663.02399114973
Hope was over , entirely over ;	603117.8376712757
F3 .	7093278.638358481
She longed to enquire of the housekeeper , whether her master were really absent , but had not courage for it .	229896.54819135778
Darcy was punctual in his return , and as Lydia informed you , attended the wedding .	265208.36875681544
It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's interested wishes , and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes , however openly or artfully spoken , could influence a young man so totally independent of every one .	180978.41605940924
I will speak to her about it myself directly .	402938.22690930456
Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley ;	402938.22690930456
and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand .	256190.74520215756
The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new , yet I think it is well expressed .	241439.52775727588
The supposition did not pain her .	603117.8376712757
Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense .	220628.02418416445
The latter was thinking only of his breakfast .	448692.4807466969
Their father then went to the library to write , and the girls walked into the breakfast-room .	256190.74520215756
and then , what do you think we did ?	402938.22690930456
he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it ;	319996.27800304984
and , after a pause of several minutes , was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion , who , in a manner , which though it spoke compassion , spoke likewise restraint , said , I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing , concern .	160598.80450568735
and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added , I have never had a cross word from him in my life , and I have known him ever since he was four years old .	187650.33801142208
Wherever you and Jane are known , you must be respected and valued ;	302466.73346396536
but Darcy can please where he chuses .	511728.00322052115
Only think of that my dear ;	603117.8376712757
and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room , its aspect and its furniture , he addressed himself particularly to her , as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him .	178778.81272199392
They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends , and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family , when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window , and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle , driving up the street .	167405.9357721537
But it ought to be done , and if you will give me a sheet of paper , it shall be done directly .	220628.02418416445
The least agreeable circumstance in the business , was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet , whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person .	203894.9364609667
And that , said Reynolds , pointing to another of the miniatures , is my master and very like him .	235335.18749647937
I should not be surprised , said Darcy , if he were to give it up , as soon as any eligible purchase offers .	216648.58268882733
I thought him very sly ;	744997.1111468794
When is your turn to come ?	603117.8376712757
'Lady Catherine , ' said she , 'you have given me a treasure .	302466.73346396536
I shall never forget her appearance this morning .	448692.4807466969
But no , recollecting herself , that could never be : my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me : I should not have been allowed to invite them .	196714.4820734748
We passed each other several times .	603117.8376712757
When they all removed to Brighton , therefore , you had no reason , I suppose , to believe them fond of each other .	216648.58268882733
Her reflections were in general satisfactory .	603117.8376712757
The officers will find women better worth their notice .	402938.22690930456
E2 .	7093278.638358481
Let us sit down .	987395.4977649314
With your good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others !	256190.74520215756
While Sir William was with them , Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig , and shewing him the country ;	216648.58268882733
she felt all the compliment it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother .	209720.11926061154
You have sense , and we all expect you to use it .	319996.27800304984
Their other engagements were few ;	744997.1111468794
Change of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home , may be as useful as anything .	229896.54819135778
Oh yes !	2646482.834236289
I often think , said she , that there is nothing so bad as parting with one's friends .	248337.34193872553
Mary had neither genius nor taste ;	603117.8376712757
1813 .	7093278.638358481
You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner in such society ;	248337.34193872553
and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character , in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of Elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end .	174982.72217245714
Elizabeth , for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts , now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since her coming away .	201317.51640173607
repeated Bennet .	2646482.834236289
but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment , had they sat in one equally lively ;	187650.33801142208
Oh !	7093278.638358481
She paused , and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse .	209720.11926061154
And to be kept back on such a motive !	402938.22690930456
