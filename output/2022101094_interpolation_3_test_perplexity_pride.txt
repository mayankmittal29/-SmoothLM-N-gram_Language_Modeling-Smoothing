Average perplexity: 442.23264095078844
I am not at all afraid of her dying .	154.37868910324866
and so accomplished !	361.4489880585092
but without scheming to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery .	175.50506033529388
She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest , by talking of their supposed marriage , and planning his happiness in such an alliance .	428.3647222349176
Hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was very glad ;	172.8822844649473
I told you in the library , you know , that I should never speak to you again , and you will find me as good as my word .	54.34215237316988
The house , furniture , neighbourhood , and roads , were all to her taste , and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most friendly and obliging .	221.1731978408008
and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle directly .	213.42736473782824
If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection , Elizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty .	1145.5972901739635
My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness , and in a cause of such moment as this , I shall certainly not depart from it .	289.8708709215707
The pain of separation , however , might be alleviated on his side , by preparations for the reception of his bride , as he had reason to hope , that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire , the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men .	116.54418538242008
No , I thank you ;	80.22755754690209
I have suspected it some time , but I am now convinced .	111.84253705289812
Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again , and weakened her disgust of Collins .	832.5588270464544
It was unpardonable .	234.14452349545874
No , said Colonel Fitzwilliam , that is an advantage which he must divide with me .	156.7792227927231
and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the probability of a rainy season , made her feel that the commonest , dullest , most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker .	243.2783891357497
Their visitors staid with them above half an hour , and when they arose to depart , Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing and Gardiner , and Miss Bennet , to dinner at Pemberley , before they left the country .	81.8059381210225
But upon my honour I do not .	203.09032559877403
She blushed , and Jane blushed ;	768.3742882862563
I promised them so faithfully !	1595.278137987999
which are naturally lively enough .	2217.2021487924753
It was a subject , in short , on which reflection would be long indulged , and must be unavailing .	162.79045397770244
The rooms were lofty and handsome , and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor ;	908.7031207546543
and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour Lady Lucas .	140.45014357864076
but Darcy , at whom it was all aimed , was still inflexibly studious .	546.1554981241705
What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosing's Park , when he put his letter into her hand !	589.3349716995608
Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas , for Collins was only a clergyman ;	214.77724776457134
The Collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave ;	637.2026980730803
Do you consider the forms of introduction , and the stress that is laid on them , as nonsense ?	321.56221374495277
As for Jane , her anxiety under this suspence was , of course , more painful than Elizabeth's ;	513.0158463600014
Indeed !	936.2050528584315
and I particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at Netherfield , '_She a beauty !	357.9118570881835
I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well , I assure you .	128.90116660212342
and , perhaps , if I have very good luck , I may meet with another Collins in time .	135.20589831528673
From herself to Jane from Jane to Bingley , her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Darcy's explanation there , had appeared very insufficient ;	336.92758722188233
My father , however , is partial to Wickham .	53.341362945664436
The dejection was almost universal .	2066.731748148284
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper ;	257.33682780460896
But in spite of all this fine talking , my dear Lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured , that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair .	114.61946260399071
No why should he ?	564.1046682451906
As Gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she and her children should go to London , at the same time that Bennet came from it .	72.62845785864101
Yet , how just a humiliation !	1235.3320447854978
Nay , when I read a letter of his , I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham , much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law .	362.13894305625763
Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ?	316.7355577245676
Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and which he thought the prettiest ?	176.7016831480781
In the afternoon , the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves ;	44.94865489517736
He has children of his own , and may have more .	109.59838136760371
Family pride , and filial pride , for he is very proud of what his father was , have done this .	198.45752218176824
It was to this effect : Since writing the above , dearest Lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ;	420.6408831046179
Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield , which was fixed for the following Tuesday .	166.12361985039104
This was his plan of amends of atonement for inheriting their father's estate ;	1647.5142574251784
and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached .	318.23817963850803
If you will thank me , he replied , let it be for yourself alone .	113.94946071851004
I hope he will overlook it .	264.33948666567295
Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her .	178.0738567464081
that he should have been in love with her for so many months !	57.115163685250636
She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting .	75.16157811376493
and as she considered that Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations , and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct , she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before .	153.63066105274117
Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again ?	269.64606996471724
She was ashamed to think how much .	114.59070259921093
Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends ?	235.24404797803606
She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference .	109.04868403183917
1813 .	662.9770795749859
Do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart .	221.67837170786572
and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer !	380.1086168291949
Did you , on reading it , give any credit to its contents ?	378.54734823334024
When tea was over , Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table but in vain .	465.37906187926404
Yes , he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word .	290.67256324748934
and Elizabeth found , that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations' consent , there was still something to be wished for .	117.78038436715424
and neither the carriage , nor the livery of the servant who preceded it , were familiar to them .	384.9150208444866
Oh , well !	808.2275608896384
for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ;	365.5709735384359
Is nothing due to me on that score ?	994.1095215024272
but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter and said , Jane , I congratulate you .	42.51934409504026
Bennet's best comfort was , that Bingley must be down again in the summer .	288.6368522573764
and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , I never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them .	237.04530337838918
The park paling was still the boundary on one side , and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground .	168.03076105500458
Jane certainly could not come back .	334.3438296754849
To the civil enquiries which then poured in , and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Bingley's , she could not make a very favourable answer .	160.02710366274982
He begged pardon for having displeased her .	542.867059003703
But she is nothing to me now .	92.87622493588152
Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time .	280.9500147589135
Miss Darcy , on her brother's entrance , exerted herself much more to talk ;	225.9345240466814
He made no answer , and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton .	55.57954050098686
the nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people !	1545.7742843369838
If , indeed , it should be so !	80.44645479564363
I cannot fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation .	200.20327016114013
He had rather hoped that all his wife's views on the stranger would be disappointed ;	317.32128175728366
CHAPTER XVI .	234.75576465601785
Her report was highly favourable .	2822.067970635221
Every body said how well she looked ;	622.2265159348335
He seemed scarcely to hear her , and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation ;	199.14479320624326
They were now almost at the door of the house , for she had walked fast to get rid of him ;	103.00638103302657
He is so excessively handsome !	307.0009710009629
for Long has just been here , and she told me all about it .	100.87130735379621
where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure ;	303.4513881395208
Darcy , after enquiring of her how and Gardiner did , a question which she could not answer without confusion , said scarcely any thing .	115.45532603919202
They gradually ascended for half a mile , and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence , where the wood ceased , and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House , situated on the opposite side of a valley , into which the road with some abruptness wound .	368.93283147049584
He was too happy , however , to need much attention ;	109.53481929141459
Why Jane you never dropt a word of this ;	903.819526759586
It was all pride and insolence .	525.3570935009832
How does Georgiana get on , Darcy ?	688.9825347217536
At such a distance as that , you know , things are strangely misrepresented .	495.1990615809057
and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted .	425.6568950206465
We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured .	380.1312860930237
pray make haste and come into the dining-room , for there is such a sight to be seen !	138.0431389469024
When they were gone , Elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent .	163.76699242499805
My dear Eliza he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way .	105.31133095660803
Her ease and good spirits increased .	771.4679530893408
Elizabeth , who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Darcy had been , was much relieved by discerning such different feelings .	352.24011753039633
Oh , yes !	155.41443917661368
, but its volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous locations .	2975.1292956393854
Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship , in spite of a great opposition of character .	276.150329928945
said Charlotte , as soon as he was gone .	76.28929738641538
There is also one other person in the party , he continued after a pause , who more particularly wishes to be known to you , Will you allow me , or do I ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton ?	104.70877503359257
When a woman has five grown up daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty .	234.9885561883964
cried his wife impatiently .	404.8290667179322
Neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude , replied Elizabeth , have any possible claim on me , in the present instance .	279.79704225190517
and addressed herself particularly to Bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation .	111.36778994871341
His manners are very different from his cousin's .	378.7915417758426
But it is so strange !	183.42809998884024
About ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire , to which he belonged .	192.83496160944227
And pray what sort of guardians do you make ?	305.6326929016855
Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in my dressing-room .	438.0786385464147
Can you possibly guess , Lizzy , who is meant by this ?	394.331332444845
You may depend upon my not mentioning it .	156.28966291374414
and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs .	216.3771728700306
and to prevent its ever happening again , took care to inform him at first , that it was a favourite haunt of hers .	182.46022875450802
certainly , cried his faithful assistant , no one can be really esteemed accomplished , who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with .	399.9220630720925
He was writing , and , without raising his head , coolly replied , Just as you please .	197.28204193112745
March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford .	701.9278692129672
Bennet was perfectly satisfied ;	197.24356029214
When the gentlemen rose to go away , Bennet was mindful of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time .	110.00135684888043
that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking Darcy's character , though he had assured her that respect for the father , would always prevent his exposing the son .	300.5416614789911
His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost .	319.9445390229345
I have not the smallest hope .	348.2363852445213
She coloured as she spoke ;	894.2619109063252
She opened the door , and met Maria in the landing place , who , breathless with agitation , cried out , Oh , my dear Eliza !	122.96944031846355
There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed .	716.3007992990931
You shall hear what she says .	110.33597923409734
I do not see what right Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend's inclination , or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy .	127.91382965866556
A few weeks , he believed .	362.1564128424519
But think no more of the letter .	119.73024431985583
When is your next ball to be , Lizzy ?	275.1898694270791
You see how continually we are engaged there .	452.8548059407215
Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours ;	1881.1855725123894
You know I always speak my mind , and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves .	158.623036107026
See paragraph 1 .	716.3429786692974
I am happier even than Jane ;	314.8001162444404
but it must be done soon .	150.30676515395612
they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence ;	937.1963958128375
if it must be so , it must .	282.65886688447495
I should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match , cried Elizabeth .	58.86572337684947
She followed her father to the fire place , and they both sat down .	119.7514501816037
We have judged it best , that my niece should be married from this house , of which I hope you will approve .	146.5112985505949
and , after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable composure .	141.85611220141462
Yes , she will remain there till Christmas .	368.10540874452437
Special rules , set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license , apply to copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark .	326.00741075679525
and Gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing , by the servant's account , that their niece was taken suddenly ill ;	408.0805640524648
Remember , Eliza , that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do .	255.28942305387346
but I think I shall like your husband quite as well as Jane's .	153.9231818570639
I do not think we were speaking at all .	99.58944090223763
Well , cried her mother , it is all very right ;	132.67683209063105
and Hurst , principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings , joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss Bennet .	396.9021329937685
Yet he is such a man !	124.15685882838112
You have delighted us long enough .	368.92472101404894
Bennet could hardly contain herself .	298.1711779216469
Be that as it may , she saw him go with regret ;	380.4292094535754
She had even learnt to detect , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary .	683.3400198623938
dear me !	3321.2772177721085
when it was no longer likely they should meet .	436.4086978012967
but with the rich , he is liberal-minded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and perhaps agreeable , allowing something for fortune and figure .	330.99869372282245
and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him .	363.73550136819836
You blamed me for coming ?	697.1730623093871
Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield ;	487.71663524349174
and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look .	149.4207576829979
Have you any idea , Lizzy , who this gentleman is ?	220.40498709752595
It was not in her nature , however , to increase her vexations , by dwelling on them .	99.06935799858002
and even Darcy acknowledged , that the partridges were remarkably well done ;	405.78369345823734
There is something very pompous in his style .	504.95981087089297
You certainly do , she replied with a smile ;	231.3363291367347
and though Collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as I have often told her , to come to Rosings every day , and play on the piano-forte in Jenkinson's room .	133.74145437276795
Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to conciliate her .	252.19173693663518
and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet .	101.39987972061857
They contained no actual complaint , nor was there any revival of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering .	1988.5686572978352
Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage ;	350.73123701548997
Kitty was the only one who shed tears ;	409.6712654819134
And then you have added so much to it yourself , you are always buying books .	200.62480572356054
This cannot be !	211.2922387336839
and Elizabeth , who knew what curiosities his letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise .	257.5996829361158
When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer , I made a point of her having two men servants go with her .	275.0470319153648
Elizabeth , on her side , had much to do .	79.32508306892198
The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a headache ;	1211.3959210261617
Indeed , Jane , you ought to believe me .	63.933359607750674
And so would Anne , if her health had allowed her to apply .	447.4330891165506
I will read it to you When my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to London , might be concluded in three or four days , but as we are certain it cannot be so , and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town , he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel .	155.4782387638192
They entered it in one of its lowest points , and drove for some time through a beautiful wood , stretching over a wide extent .	540.9150305868865
May we take my uncle's letter to read to her ?	1061.4216320839375
When the card tables were placed , he had an opportunity of obliging her in return , by sitting down to whist .	120.59228356840966
After a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display .	246.59958622099376
but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands .	188.3034346689378
he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and that , if he marry prudently , his wife may teach him .	406.4910326956954
and Bennet , for many years after Lydia's birth , had been certain that he would .	145.9463833763187
and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements , new carriages and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield , in the course of three or four months .	176.1043718774493
hatred had vanished long ago , and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him , that could be so called .	241.36860840474796
But I will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well .	178.71753667718482
If his own vanity , however , did not mislead him , he was the cause , his pride and caprice were the cause of all that Jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer .	93.92051555914938
I fancy , Lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all .	181.10693907231703
Their affectionate mother shared all their grief ;	1896.2160467014342
a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room .	136.23384763337978
Pray , how violent was Bingley's love ?	1102.7070534569837
but Lady Catherine very resolutely , and not very politely , declined eating any thing ;	362.2629516391687
Now what have you to say ?	431.0022714925714
and in front , a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater , but without any artificial appearance .	1031.1340392441275
He carved , and ate , and praised with delighted alacrity ;	906.1391707950061
E5 .	7036.6709905557955
But though every thing seemed neat and comfortable , she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance ;	407.255485106371
When I am in the country , he replied , I never wish to leave it ;	61.40138743437426
It only shews her being deficient in something herself sense or feeling .	1314.1478833720105
Yes , very well .	159.96781022869024
and , though she was not very sanguine in expecting it , the application was a something to look forward to .	175.28793140823186
Is this a hint to me , Lizzy , said her father , to send for the horses ?	65.88025623090012
and more than commonly anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her .	316.46467314385194
However , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts , and I am very glad to hear what you tell us , of long sleeves .	123.4701078652852
you know he is , as well as I do ;	130.6197172697154
Pray forgive me , if I have been very presuming , or at least do not punish me so far , as to exclude me from P I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park .	196.1248441560691
Your idea of the ponies is delightful .	560.2459653452992
then recollecting himself , I will not detain you a minute , but let me , or let the servant , go after and Gardiner .	254.13956586823554
In the first place , he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron .	118.34864099381016
but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you .	185.3484415673898
Bennet could not have chosen better .	252.1004676637235
and know them to be so much attached to me !	114.53190672848575
Her sister made not the smallest objection , and the piano-forte was opened , and Darcy , after a few moments recollection , was not sorry for it .	89.6791051014564
Elizabeth was surprised , but said not a word .	82.38628863553676
CHAPTER X More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park , unexpectedly meet Darcy .	303.63264779932217
They have none of them much to recommend them , replied he ;	94.71560573632293
After walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on resuming their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant , there chanced to be a little alteration .	231.91613055541566
and Collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much .	863.7466713516989
and yet it should seem by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy .	85.55672283719309
I dare say you believed it ;	55.7628181798135
You are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on ;	188.66116298862056
nothing , therefore , could be fairly conjectured from that , though Elizabeth , who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings , was perfectly aware , that , had she known nothing of Darcy , she could have borne the dread of Lydia's infamy somewhat better .	142.63821800024803
her voice was weak , and her manner affected .	383.50017999242834
Would you believe it , Lizzy , that when he went to town last November , he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent , would have prevented his coming down again !	72.70470288618118
he kissed it with affectionate gallantry , though he hardly knew how to look , and they entered the house .	132.14218906355657
The particulars , I reserve till we meet .	547.8464652796049
and she looked on the whole scene , the river , the trees scattered on its banks , and the winding of the valley , as far as she could trace it , with delight .	157.97564441405535
It was an animating subject , and Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match .	148.16787043286521
Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ;	151.35199783469585
Neither could any thing be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities which Darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach .	300.70797349207197
She then sought her eldest sister , who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley .	215.83796310346267
From Collins !	1609.4948759959507
Will you do me the honour of reading that letter ?	237.47489188012668
So , Lizzy , said he one day , your sister is crossed in love I find .	135.09835489762432
Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately ;	101.30248135187968
There was no want of discourse .	78.5717100494658
His coming into the country at all , is a most insolent thing indeed , and I wonder how he could presume to do it .	124.1779347894136
So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him !	719.2931757503151
and he was obliged to walk about the room , while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences .	173.67367688782412
How well it sounds .	3659.8410983921895
It should not be said , that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers .	53.38208993735872
and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself ;	255.07516416950352
They found Bennet still up .	680.589448939715
and they conversed with so much spirit and flow , as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself , as well as of Darcy .	132.73282605476177
But it is , returned she ;	288.0859060034661
He shook his head .	206.78530348317892
His daughter's request , for such it might be considered , of being admitted into her family again , before she set off for the North , received at first an absolute negative .	211.0923644305908
Stop me whilst you can .	2084.7658353943357
Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure , and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming , when she found herself so affectionately received .	253.49955522230266
Is it possible !	909.8772579630609
Let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ;	238.57288746271493
He delighted in going to Pemberley , especially when he was least expected .	123.25902302220342
I had no notion but he would go a shooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company .	202.8441058936157
Elizabeth was in agonies .	631.7193628416068
Your uncle is as much surprised as I am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned , would have allowed him to act as he has done .	101.06655440296258
This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted : and Elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away .	196.15763153122887
Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to his wife ?	770.2306142633379
On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects .	363.0728455966944
An express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from Colonel Forster , to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers ;	148.06277669820946
This has been my motive , my fair cousin , and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem .	131.71956516667566
You ought certainly to forgive them as a christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing .	464.8183827073637
I will not encourage the impudence of either , by receiving them at Longbourn .	82.94617410864785
The next morning , however , made an alteration ;	150.85000235267583
Charlotte is an excellent manager , I dare say .	409.1018387063777
It is evident by this , added Jane , that he comes back no more this winter .	113.63031951650217
To be sure that did seem as if he admired her indeed I rather believe he did I heard something about it but I hardly know what something about Robinson .	173.58105010728647
With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ;	465.7117761579144
When she remembered the style of his address , she was still full of indignation ;	247.65298261566946
When first Bennet had married , economy was held to be perfectly useless ;	929.012651424424
The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came , and Bennet was forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle , was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth .	96.4335407301865
can it be really so !	1040.964328600969
She had never seen a place for which nature had done more , or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste .	333.9221895158008
I hope , added Gardiner , that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her .	231.19901684306097
what can have induced him to behave so cruelly ?	1699.5760327172677
Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications .	675.7686678815933
His eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity ;	345.599434252915
As soon as all had ate , and the elder ones paid , the carriage was ordered ;	278.800152918975
You know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself .	131.9533914654679
Let me hear what it is .	111.65377116539509
He meant , I believe , replied Jane , to go to Epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the postilions , and try if any thing could be made out from them .	201.17854577497917
observed Bennet .	2386.033590043485
and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible .	85.34930804711308
The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic .	966.2744511264227
My overhearings were more to the purpose than yours , Eliza , said Charlotte .	360.4122999218912
his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had .	171.30289521693302
said Elizabeth .	359.76065498339705
The first mentioned was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , I had detached Bingley from your sister , and the other , that I had , in defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , ruined the immediate prosperity , and blasted the prospects of Wickham .	142.72453842334068
Darcy is all politeness , said Elizabeth , smiling .	93.8314047456097
said Jane .	432.6607428011162
It was some days , however , before they received any invitation thither , for while there were visitors in the house , they could not be necessary ;	129.15384979086346
Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth and it was soon done done while Bennet was stirring the fire .	344.67356325678793
I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings , and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three , of whom we shall deprive you .	511.2211682525459
It taught me to hope , said he , as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before .	117.05635943430998
but since then , we have both , I hope , improved in civility .	116.52280091774949
but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him .	102.15819722575755
When Jane and Elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in her praise of Bingley before , expressed to her sister how very much she admired him .	230.77192988984456
There can be no love in all this .	169.88244390752112
Yet it is hard , she sometimes thought , that this poor man cannot come to a house , which he has legally hired , without raising all this speculation !	586.8640856114769
and Bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice .	169.70267447601626
Good heavens !	5528.0861282154165
If I had been able , said she , to carry my point of going to Brighton , with all my family , this would not have happened ;	67.72474268424173
Indeed I had .	264.2043694560078
and in the mean time , she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married , to Hill and the two housemaids .	202.87888418049937
Lydia's being settled in the North , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment ;	281.23306790538396
The younger ones out before the elder are married !	259.9300878081536
My excellent father died about five years ago ;	655.5947535916638
We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening , said Elizabeth .	240.79376220877947
And if you will stay another month complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London , for I am going there early in June , for a week ;	107.82203803631437
Lizzy , you must not do so .	107.61729505213118
Only look at her .	588.6683168482161
and the Hursts have no horses to theirs .	1188.7416109820879
She directly replied , You need not be frightened .	313.8246438800447
How nicely we are crammed in !	1200.6392045471655
The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning's impatience .	812.3705091659431

Lizzy , when you first read that letter , I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now .	116.55323941526309
but her's she thought was still worse .	832.8099626240896
and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty .	381.2329899884493
But does Lydia know nothing of this ?	299.99095822759375
She counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent ;	1366.9148682500872
Can such abominable pride as his , have ever done him good ?	1350.9588394354134
Oh !	298.0706733468098
Good Heaven !	268.16899036376185
Have all her friends left her ?	742.4295178781819
Their brother , indeed , was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency .	145.7051581592671
The colour which had been driven from her face , returned for half a minute with an additional glow , and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes , as she thought for that space of time , that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken .	338.58520673922044
Pardon me .	268.2869314536657
My dear , dear Lizzy , I would I do congratulate you but are you certain ?	105.09563012845311
Her father had been an attorney in Meryton , and had left her four thousand pounds .	63.70387324132612
She had fully proposed being engaged by Wickham for those very dances : and to have Collins instead !	1050.6787855723387
I am so grieved for him .	111.13131017761181
She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together .	196.38985827236377
no , I certainly am not .	350.51831622189616
You quite mistook Darcy .	1221.2713556377269
but this is the true one .	288.884196830739
Yes , in conjunction with his friend .	214.97629743539855
and still different from either , was what Bennet sent to Collins , in reply to his last .	173.789324630125
Bingley was every thing that was charming , except the professed lover of her daughter .	208.8129662249007
They repulsed every attempt of Bennet at conversation , and by so doing , threw a languor over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Collins , who was complimenting Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests .	160.19211488451413
As all conversation was thereby at an end , Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room .	263.811312860615
Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject ;	269.53714535430385
When first he came in , he had spoken to her but little ;	149.86499258729478
If it is designedly done , they cannot be justified ;	451.53063847631523
But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both .	216.32416624393005
and , as they drew near the appointed inn where Bennet's carriage was to meet them , they quickly perceived , in token of the coachman's punctuality , both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs .	294.10857934764397
What , none of you ?	284.751989276261
Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman , and required information ;	582.457724459714
Well , my comfort is , I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done .	76.50632987429181
Too much , I am afraid ;	340.81565009427794
This was very amiable , but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any conception of ;	394.7018609516185
His family knew him to be on all common occasions , a most negligent and dilatory correspondent , but at such a time , they had hoped for exertion .	313.2038976825992
His first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance , as far as it would go .	78.32806599309374
She wanted to talk , but there seemed an embargo on every subject .	173.32813202711802
In every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived .	278.2569960866218
but on perceiving Darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner .	1078.5421538381265
She was more alive to the disgrace , which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham , a fortnight before they took place .	269.5632088205331
and Gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in London the very next day , and would assist Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia .	118.58206117517508
And then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you ;	166.2690221287083
As for Elizabeth , her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last ;	150.50738396868869
They are not married , nor can I find there was any intention of being so ;	135.05960978879386
for you are really proud of your defects in writing , because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution , which if not estimable , you think at least highly interesting .	476.5569414931661
You never will be able to make both of them good for any thing .	127.90089523875838
They walked towards the Lucases , because Kitty wished to call upon Maria ;	339.27244227001637
But you see that Jane , said her aunt , does not think so ill of Wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt .	41.57201771144266
I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ;	399.28584317310816
it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it .	252.82207395282475
The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend , assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London , might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment .	101.04147900236394
She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either , or make either appear to advantage .	196.47267504536413
You allude perhaps to the entail of this estate .	169.3353312148349
She could not win him , however , to any conversation ;	136.23014827783652
by her ease and liveliness , his mind might have been softened , his manners improved , and from his judgment , information , and knowledge of the world , she must have received benefit of greater importance .	186.6754783905608
Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone .	463.04163894866315
I enquired after their brother , of course .	100.16871678809447
Bennet could hardly comprehend it .	662.0465907214033
and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both .	192.09362371018364
Dear me !	2901.402895419442
by reason , by reflection , by every thing .	237.30649700333547
to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed , and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation , console herself for the present , and prepare for another disappointment .	136.04546446872618
During dinner , Bennet scarcely spoke at all ;	896.4898393128653
To convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself , was no very difficult point .	133.9327850221842
my daughters are brought up differently .	963.1861081018255
and after listening a moment , she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry , and calling loudly after her .	370.9923002471467
Why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent , said she , did he come at all ?	140.02234554076193
I do think it is the hardest thing in the world , that your estate should be entailed away from your own children ;	123.15982709885841
Bennet treasured up the hint , and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married ;	168.44203214180186
Do you know Bingley ?	323.1502003439798
Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy .	884.6029065784102
and very unwillingly said so .	528.612721390916
Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter ;	324.59466583553433
Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not .	114.97791931611056
He had been some time with Gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river , and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning .	125.57860354417176
He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies , of whose beauty he had heard much ;	155.74629570400649
Good God !	1408.0735531343091
Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever .	179.75451023514816
Something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them , but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life .	78.55326761458888
it came from Netherfield , and was opened immediately .	178.1211903983274
They have each their advantages , and I can be equally happy in either .	249.9519966109701
She was wild to be at home to hear , to see , to be upon the spot , to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her , in a family so deranged ;	317.9822161049615
In making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self-reproach .	179.60256278633895
CHAPTER I Elizabeth , as they drove along , watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation ;	445.5267658230307
Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance ;	224.1431278139481
And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton , of whom I shall subjoin a list , according to his information .	299.43202262150345
But make a virtue of it by all means .	347.91835870906635
Arguments are too much like disputes .	1449.4822981854145
I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , Lizzy ?	143.8059522382836
The rest of the evening passed with the appearance , on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no farther attempt to distinguish Elizabeth ;	128.9425834669947
I believe , Ma'am , I may safely promise you never to dance with him .	83.27823700865558
No , no .	239.18153842198546
and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least .	169.71159547419094
At length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself .	108.66431316015513
She followed him with her eyes , envied every one to whom he spoke , had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee ;	254.13258778323132
I never saw such a long chin in my life .	130.54279992816043
I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield .	103.59432692491731
cried Elizabeth ;	285.4553762999787
but this was all lost upon me .	288.1600493538561
No , Kitty , I have at last learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it .	99.32546963691742
The principal purport of his letter was to inform them , that Wickham had resolved on quitting the Militia .	121.92134952489975
I shall be very fit to see Jane which is all I want .	147.47361852534564
When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford , every eye was in search of the Parsonage , and every turning expected to bring it in view .	213.85472433591573
her complexion has no brilliancy ;	3203.242384574324
said her mother as soon as she was in the hall .	149.9000613282358
They will join me early to-morrow , he continued , and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you , Bingley and his sisters .	237.52574070316328
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity .	418.67356486475717
I do not mind his not talking to Long , said Miss Lucas , but I wish he had danced with Eliza .	134.2898392784921
but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder .	131.4916328151011
Yes , there can ;	375.5275297304417
If you received the work electronically , the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund .	166.85860045907344
Make haste , make haste .	245.535442004189
My reasons for believing it are briefly these : It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance , or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable .	360.1983455706479
After amusing himself some time with their curiosity , he thus explained .	538.7493817149002
I had not believed it possible .	145.15597443403564
Forgive me ;	349.4250278375225
This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself .	229.79788871030038
Darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say something indistinctly of his concern , and observe her in compassionate silence .	212.95745572284028
At length there was nothing more to be said ;	210.66182863272152
Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ;	1017.7868568169023
She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room .	255.51778014308434
But at least it shews , that she was serious in the object of her journey .	102.32504732836074
but , exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone .	1894.7847891568604
Elizabeth quietly answered Undoubtedly ;	2804.9569817476495
Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic ;	1677.1430109332832
You must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course .	109.60445162795763
I can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ;	201.3731704819779
Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming .	348.8206141507135
I dare say she will ;	86.00478812864908
But self , though it would intrude , could not engross her .	259.2831313003722
His temptation is not adequate to the risk .	787.5161576259778
a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point , without being resented .	541.517032530417
Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal from the shire , as clearly as Gardiner could do .	208.12831850768907
To Bennet's acknowledgments he briefly replied , with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family ;	180.1340474244739
When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned , in terms of such mortifying , yet merited reproach , her sense of shame was severe .	129.1782639834311
He is now gone into the army , she added , but I am afraid he has turned out very wild .	70.77574828706243
and , after giving each of them an hasty kiss , hurried into the vestibule , where Jane , who came running down stairs from her mother's apartment , immediately met her .	297.6511663269201
Take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one .	173.56407402332468
I am most seriously displeased .	766.5184712690875
When they ascended the steps to the hall , Maria's alarm was every moment increasing , and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm .	331.62545371994975
My feelings will not be repressed .	626.7997691041776
Nor was Darcy's vindication , though grateful to her feelings , capable of consoling her for such discovery .	266.0260565158592
All that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds , secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ;	220.3230314192634
My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other .	385.5628251392053
She has known him only a fortnight .	170.7674119215132
I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being .	223.65368572319198
and Elizabeth , as they waited for the housekeeper , had leisure to wonder at her being where she was .	60.88942069939492
Elizabeth , though expecting no less , thanked him with tears of gratitude ;	423.73295502212596
I am sick of them all .	56.13150770317701
You shall not , for the sake of one individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that selfishness is prudence , and insensibility of danger , security for happiness .	182.57833550343926
Elizabeth now began to revive .	605.5916198504658
She received him with her very best politeness , which he returned with as much more , apologising for his intrusion , without any previous acquaintance with her , which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice .	121.299515057348
Very nonsensical to come at all !	1200.1637158016267
Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to identify , do copyright research on , transcribe and proofread public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm collection .	876.3200890424931
From that moment I observed my friend's behaviour attentively ;	2829.9659368495304
One enjoyment was certain that of suitableness as companions ;	1841.4289026507129
And if I am that choice , why may not I accept him ?	262.3513511252797
D The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you can do with this work .	303.8620771554939
Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival , that Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine ;	118.3331830396062
Elizabeth smiled .	418.6366160847823
Such doings discomposed Bennet exceedingly .	2497.137086777568
My sister , who is more than ten years my junior , was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew , Colonel Fitzwilliam , and myself .	81.4457259966004
It suddenly struck her that it might be from lady Catherine ;	190.6433925018
E8 .	806.2902343264145
Let Wickham be your man .	2318.6634384784306
She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it .	259.7764426093346
At last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance of Darcy , with such a smile over the face , as she remembered to have sometimes seen , when he looked at her .	124.15203062932643
and whenever they changed their quarters , either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to , for some little assistance towards discharging their bills .	614.0784774345408
But I must write no more .	175.16377081040247
and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation .	454.2788927094452
Write to me very often , my dear .	311.3610600212672
She could see him instantly before her , in every charm of air and address ;	172.12080177977276
But , really , I know not what to say .	99.58512910320887
and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it , to Ramsgate ;	408.97499786643004
His plan did not vary on seeing them .	271.6300829774427
Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ?	486.931244932471
just enough to make one good sort of man ;	187.01606163618882
and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been ;	740.588439552731
Poor Jane !	2057.992200360447
The more I see of the world , the more am I dissatisfied with it ;	164.47954078397336
He and his sisters were well , I hope , when you left London .	101.32402764688666
International donations are gratefully accepted , but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States .	323.3663709207312
CHAPTER III .	249.51422743723455
Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect , that the sight of such rooms , so many servants , and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them .	221.40080382268877
Don't keep coughing so , Kitty , for heaven's sake !	885.7712823935282
Under such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief .	214.01957084041877
and at that moment she felt , that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something !	148.49848185235194
Lord , how ashamed I should be of not being married before three and twenty !	346.82772812471165
She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure .	286.5266357003588
nor could she for many hours , learn to think of it less than incessantly .	158.82045119565603
You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness ;	860.8670899596494
His consenting to marry her is a proof , I will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking .	129.52447161209662
To-morrow fortnight .	1976.9705507960787
but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other , of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that Denny had brought him from London , and that he was to have a lieutenant's commission in the shire .	133.69768259734346
It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way .	187.54738264286252
My youngest of all , is lately married , and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds , walking with a young man , who I believe will soon become a part of the family .	114.95049392296495
They were then , with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance , taken into the house ;	180.14660191287552
But Elizabeth , who had not the least inclination to remain with them , laughingly answered , No , no ;	205.06471146384038
and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement .	374.43336137866925
All field sports were over .	1676.502725398526
My style of writing is very different from yours .	431.9680018362862
c .	684.2143304361672
and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror , Gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power .	260.47377079584635
Thus , we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition .	982.592905285175
She wrote even to Jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her former professions of regard .	110.32275489127102
CHAPTER X The day passed much as the day before had done .	227.80416885107257
He merely added , that he should not write again , till he had something of importance to mention .	118.15045307020448
It originated in Gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support , and consequently preferred her husband's .	562.8977650786647
After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with It is your turn to say something now , Darcy .	152.12065660762198
and his commendation of every thing would have touched Bennet's heart , but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property .	260.5446973584255
She comes to us to-day .	422.7218911372431
I will not tell you what it is .	74.68566700111941
At length however Bennet had no more to say ;	180.38768810466152
The power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor , and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance .	288.5811988486838
Then turning to Bennet , he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon .	520.1663461011639
The subjection in which his father had brought him up , had given him originally great humility of manner , but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head , living in retirement , and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity .	313.34531790118035
From the entrance hall , of which Collins pointed out , with a rapturous air , the fine proportion and finished ornaments , they followed the servants through an anti-chamber , to the room where Lady Catherine , her daughter , and Jenkinson were sitting .	397.17928894595036
and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over .	162.33895263281823
Now , said she , that this first meeting is over , I feel perfectly easy .	189.23706588109368
The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited .	257.60963467252674
After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight , and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear ;	473.443380706231
What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy ?	139.75980049418894
Lydia was exceedingly fond of him .	224.94491246808042
When coffee was over , Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him ;	346.09599736341954
I do not believe she often sees such at home .	223.28476954035753
A clergyman like you must marry .	405.98255126033087
But gracious me !	895.0511690607467
It was agreed to .	87.86876917185658
But she would not be secure .	223.50194029856794
Though I shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ;	683.7964168792597
You are so strange !	283.03099911088106
Having resolved to do it without loss of time , as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday , and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment , he set about it in a very orderly manner , with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business .	247.60023955989652
E GARDINER .	2088.6065495150265
For my own part , she rejoined , I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her .	190.29111814202378
and in the evening Bennet's invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter .	206.5393512410487
Yes , always , she replied , without knowing what she said , for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , I remember hearing you once say , Darcy , that you hardly ever forgave , that your resentment once created was unappeasable .	172.6375917649737
my sweetest Lizzy !	2001.2487644991847
And I think you will agree with me , in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece's .	499.770053545596
Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations ;	439.79452723674086
CHAPTER XVIII .	234.75576465601785
F6 .	7036.6709905557955
that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her , and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening .	109.44528867371858
CHAPTER III .	249.51422743723455
What a charming amusement for young people this is , Darcy !	468.0535917066148
I remember , as soon as ever I saw him , when he first came into Hertfordshire last year , I thought how likely it was that you should come together .	82.68597974841043
But it is all , all too late now .	188.01556871784743
and Bennet found , with amazement and horror , that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter .	462.90533336454826
She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse , but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other , and how formal and cold was their manner , whenever they did .	142.47069307954578
No one who has ever seen you together , can doubt his affection .	386.11198938427225
Elizabeth listened as little as she could , but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name .	175.84442479214633
that it should be equally unreserved was impossible .	321.86127896703795
It is because he will not give himself the trouble .	308.20777699460757
Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself , and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam , Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word I say .	126.37929081591389
He is perfectly well behaved , polite , and unassuming , said her uncle .	356.37518159224584
You have reduced him to his present state of poverty , comparative poverty .	842.774138441905
Nearly three weeks .	1437.4655008012437
Oh !	298.0706733468098
His appearance was greatly in his favour ;	492.8832204556695
I have sent for you on an affair of importance .	248.34363865367072
When to these recollections was added the developement of Wickham's character , it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before , were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful .	460.37997153765554
but Ashworth is too far off !	1164.6129736372052
She now lost every expectation of pleasure .	289.83461005328536
Miss Bennet , replied her ladyship , in an angry tone , you ought to know , that I am not to be trifled with .	70.3740842644502
for I consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman .	284.6437072684076
On reaching the spacious lobby above , they were shewn into a very pretty sitting-room , lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below ;	598.0762561207263
You know pretty well , I suppose , what has been done for the young people .	94.41070435842104
At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted .	470.53090936020436
I never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong .	829.7346011419721
Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible .	733.1281288383277
Elizabeth silently attended her .	359.5767774765107
Oh , Jane , take care .	137.62595018838638
Oh !	298.0706733468098
' But afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time .	539.3192844032426
She examined into their employments , looked at their work , and advised them to do it differently ;	402.1679631347569
CHAPTER XI .	234.75576465601785
unless you looked up to him as a superior .	411.4625417678094
I have therefore made up my mind to tell you , that I do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare .	214.83713370368278
and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William , in which she was readily joined by Jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of Collins , and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London .	105.2330163261955
Who do you mean , my dear ?	220.39445766667242
Though Bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage .	76.62361569004405
how can it affect them ?	787.595683389178
They had nothing to accuse him of but pride ;	140.7675232954864
He was coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland : when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey .	167.11675448579985
Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game , except when Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh's being too hot or too cold , or having too much or too little light .	580.8091953618056
but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future .	172.11902803340524

He scarcely ever spoke to her , and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself , were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas , whose civility in listening to him , was a seasonable relief to them all , and especially to her friend .	69.44820987408553
CHAPTER VIII .	234.75576465601785
When at length they arose to take leave , Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn ;	188.89509942933668
I could see him with perfect indifference , but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of .	71.16814633504158
I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes .	376.88565370775757
and the two , who were most anxiously expected , to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen , were in very good time .	174.01735798625663
No one but Bennet , regretted that their stay would be so short ;	467.8321065366683
Lydia has no brothers to step forward ;	1136.083193713224
CHAPTER XII .	234.75576465601785
Well , mamma , said she , when they were all returned to the breakfast room , and what do you think of my husband ?	48.002816677094444
'Tis as good as a Lord !	1034.3291290226966
forgive the question are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ?	221.39319002509248
and therefore gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent , his actions were capable of a very different construction ;	149.48840601069674
But what is that to me ?	187.8967387730687
a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade .	810.5222095345614
To fortune I am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since I am well aware that it could not be complied with ;	137.91098963775323
Girls , can I do any thing for you in Meryton ?	229.42708124300523
[ Illustration : Morning Dress .	676.8010853566328
But the wife of Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation , that she could , upon the whole , have no cause to repine .	108.97660553082137
Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table , and they went up stairs together .	89.35063958682848
Your alliance will be a disgrace ;	364.3171425652432
I have every reason in the world to think ill of you .	112.25639161527351
Elizabeth immediately recognising the livery , guessed what it meant , and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations , by acquainting them with the honour which she expected .	495.6514960647452
At present , indeed , they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood ;	297.08821736274376
The world has been deceived in that respect ;	353.0653872348637
Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility ;	248.4905218229863
He must write his own sermons ;	797.7892661242241
which will not be yours till after your mother's decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to .	190.6277693276595
She stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation , and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery .	310.5764232956914
Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ?	267.7985907376046
Miss Darcy's praise occupied the chief of it .	334.2842826244081
Recovering himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said , Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of .	172.91273689483117
Is her husband , is the son of his late father's steward , to be his brother ?	173.33550412059756
Lady Catherine approached , and , after listening for a few minutes , said to Darcy , Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss , if she practised more , and could have the advantage of a London master .	86.14189072491503
but Sir William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane , who were dancing together .	210.917464759177
How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell , but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you .	352.942056471466
Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother .	394.27559681776467
Certainly , replied Elizabeth there are such people , but I hope I am not one of them .	64.29820379161045
See paragraph 1 .	716.3429786692974
I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did .	125.49113413278847
Had his own happiness , however , been the only sacrifice , he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best ;	139.53236538396868
And with a bow to Darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room .	166.32425825113557
She would not betray her trust , I suppose , without bribery and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be found .	235.6247898337191
but they were now necessary , and she assured him with some confusion , of her attachment to Darcy .	82.76772885200752
All was acknowledged , and half the night spent in conversation .	201.44635182027594
If we are ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been , said Elizabeth , and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what Gardiner has done for them , because Wickham has not sixpence of his own .	204.0724261113851
Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father .	637.3085096202477
Hunsford , near Westerham , Kent , 15th October .	2213.369369503624
Bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from London , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time .	75.05765231148257
and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life .	155.4981614541922
I would keep a pack of foxhounds , and drink a bottle of wine every day .	603.1788137777662
Now , seriously , what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence ?	756.8438228502796
and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to elope with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ;	360.424673418421
Must it be so ?	969.5788832765905
These bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had I with greater policy concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified , unalloyed inclination ;	1216.8080117579275
I hope she will turn out well .	364.85263541351367
Teaze him laugh at him .	1343.1951571995646
She danced four dances with him at Meryton ;	435.13499947685966
While the contents of the first letter remained on her mind , she was all surprise all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl , whom it was impossible he could marry for money ;	232.8803757353498
Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start , and before he could recover himself enough to speak , she , in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's situation , hastily exclaimed , I beg your pardon , but I must leave you .	245.58388623743616
I know not , Miss Elizabeth , said he , whether Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us , but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it .	90.85536236310594
And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection .	169.47440371775605
Any place would do , of about three or four hundred a year ;	674.068369662368
The note was immediately dispatched , and its contents as quickly complied with .	384.2891127876101
and when it closed , Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon Charlotte's degree of contentment , to understand her address in guiding , and composure in bearing with her husband , and to acknowledge that it was all done very well .	335.97495101232994
But no letter appeared , and she was completely puzzled .	440.96999839508055
This was a lucky idea of mine , indeed !	201.86651240758704
but it is not sound .	344.48173796684733
What is his name ?	302.29370929388136
Reynolds , either from pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister .	221.4197110672816
Her look and manners were open , cheerful and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and I remained convinced from the evening's scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment .	255.79159239131832
Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer , and forced his younger sister to be civil also , and say what the occasion required .	403.22126544523013
Every thing that is charming !	302.0898687537862
and after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do , which was the more probable from the time of year .	221.6264895410488
Brother-in-law of Wickham !	1830.054712630364
Happy shall I be , when his stay at Netherfield is over !	884.231566315888
Miss Darcy was tall , and on a larger scale than Elizabeth ;	279.27915654854587
At present we have nothing to guide us .	301.1393694411058
The account of his connection with the Pemberley family , was exactly what he had related himself ;	82.1456913229239
Your sisters are engaged , and there is not another woman in the room , whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with .	67.87046473211882
When I wrote that letter , replied Darcy , I believed myself perfectly calm and cool , but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit .	141.63273325045233
The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth , as the first .	206.73633349004908
We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Wickham with money .	354.20114958107973
As soon as they had driven from the door , Elizabeth was called on by her cousin , to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings , which , for Charlotte's sake , she made more favourable than it really was .	76.49742516411696
They may wish many things besides his happiness ;	613.6658323029786
I must conclude , for I cannot be long from my poor mother .	114.17690182248425
cried Elizabeth , brightening up for a moment .	172.82918432156833
But however he did not .	212.32053753863073
Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Hurst or Miss Bingley ;	1435.552365235693
Your friend performs delightfully ;	4200.543663292696
and the valley , here contracted into a glen , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it .	609.5504385240631
They could talk of nothing but officers ;	240.17630020698164
Their conduct has been such , replied Elizabeth , as neither you , nor I , nor any body , can ever forget .	257.28445080880584
She had obtained private intelligence that Darcy did not wish for cards ;	361.73509824695856
why is not every body as happy ?	661.3013681977168
nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable .	245.1605878427312
He had never before supposed that , could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter , it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself , as by the present arrangement .	98.57604636678612
Kitty stared at him , and Lydia exclaimed .	418.5221691621229
Elizabeth could not help saying , It is very much to his credit , I am sure , that you should think so .	43.124302267023545
On their being joined by Bingley himself , Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas ;	299.34342311090523
Wickham passed all his youth there , you know .	614.4877211971761
As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , I shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females .	287.26605784665145
Very little was said by either ;	992.8946636963262
repeated Elizabeth , in utter amazement .	541.4924845113176
her liveliness had been never worse timed .	3468.8902964343806
Perhaps it will be as well , if you discourage his coming here so very often .	117.55980297337098
CHAPTER V Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate .	601.6127242082053
She retreated from the window , fearful of being seen ;	255.1333647680031
he sustained it however with fortitude , and so far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into conversation with Gardiner .	127.86237715856285
She shared in their attendance on Bennet , and was a great comfort to them , in their hours of freedom .	110.13406257726133
Does he know his real character ?	903.3627698181665
In her kind schemes for Elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam .	426.50815088159425
We shall often meet , I hope , in Hertfordshire .	116.99422177980306
replied Kitty , it looks just like that man that used to be with him before .	392.97799401892456
If you were to give me forty such men , I never could be so happy as you .	131.5429650328026
She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious , made no other reply to Elizabeth's salutation , than a slight inclination of the head , and sat down without saying a word .	105.10136782547742
He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever , on the occasion .	139.81160485929954
What is to become of us !	205.77271078837492
It was kindly meant .	423.7685825846275
Lydia declared herself satisfied .	920.0159671657633
My sister , I am sure , will not hear of her removal .	114.29177015099809
The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities , though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings ;	358.9984662000465
If it was not for the entail I should not mind it .	100.96816342753995
And then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it .	124.98568936504927
They have some of the finest woods in the country .	230.10621599662858
Oh !	298.0706733468098
What did you say of me , that I did not deserve ?	150.5888975067109
You forget that I have made no answer .	91.40862493825989
Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility .	254.43366475263244
Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied , Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully .	358.49257092666363
I know not what to think .	105.87311727625719
Bennet could not give her consent , or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , though she talked to Bingley of nothing else , for half an hour ;	171.98981025426625
She knew not what to think , nor how to account for it .	80.00190594728895
So much the better .	165.5765029945374
You wanted me , I know , to say 'Yes , ' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste ;	335.64527830171573
It is admirable !	733.226105132679
They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which I cannot wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects .	199.67505089357246
pride he probably had , and if not , it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town , where the family did not visit .	405.2833352303292
But , Lizzy , you can tell us whether it is like or not .	150.59676658321217
and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's dying an old maid .	310.93173663494014
The wisest and the best of men , nay , the wisest and best of their actions , may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke .	261.92544971464747
Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper ;	747.0988417872048
and it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning , and never said a word about it till now .	78.42524580197369
After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room , from the sideboard to the fender , to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London , Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden , which was large and well laid out , and to the cultivation of which he attended himself .	184.37897758459218
I should infinitely prefer a book .	221.62438597589045
but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless Darcy returned within the stated time .	648.6673439417518
This is not to be borne .	272.4621446400519
Had his first appearance , or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining , been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Darcy , the gardener's expression of surprise , on beholding his master , must immediately have told it .	256.25207775476144
Hurst had therefore nothing to do , but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep .	421.55520915990354
I thought it would never be over ;	122.04387166836766
But if I do not take your likeness now , I may never have another opportunity .	145.05140446341684
Elizabeth made no answer , and walked on , her heart swelling with indignation .	152.77387200136633
And do you like her ?	145.66194626143732
It was an evening of no common delight to them all ;	178.0400970957596
I never can be thankful , Bennet , for any thing about the entail .	90.79873189494391
Were the same fair prospect to arise at present , as had flattered them a year ago , every thing , she was persuaded , would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion .	264.5667035614632
He danced only four dances !	1416.397333768754
I have not a doubt of Bingley's sincerity , said Elizabeth warmly ;	199.029574389414
Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother , on his approaching marriage , were all that was affectionate and insincere .	161.63936598549577
Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort .	546.4376941420961
He likes to have his own way very well , replied Colonel Fitzwilliam .	167.26153805490813
It was painful , exceedingly painful , to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return .	112.97253925455374
Yes , thought Elizabeth , that would be a delightful scheme , indeed , and completely do for us at once .	76.52710072589204
but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off .	431.74064881851314
said he hastily , as he opened the door .	161.32363944388587
She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own , but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action , she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage .	228.0053871181177
As often as I can .	345.84928472220065
If you love Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham , you must be very happy .	79.1284809728541
She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas .	202.56057587297533
Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming , without changing colour .	89.29013343340762
1 .	384.9991185797929
You may depend on it , replied the other , for Nicholls was in Meryton last night ;	113.14208239968656
and she could hardly suppress a smile , at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had revolted , in his offer to herself .	209.59875246638978
I told Collins so before you came .	415.442706541451
I knew , said he , that what I wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary .	103.13756647419302
Why did not you seek legal redress ?	849.007651873055
When they repaired to the dining-room , Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place , which , in all their former parties , had belonged to him , by her sister .	78.66758524297515
It was necessary to laugh , when she would rather have cried .	132.75436863054367
Soon after you left me on Saturday , I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were .	143.47305449663767
but I always speak what I think .	266.24063265183077
And rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had not Collins thus addressed her , When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ;	111.78475715229689
But that is nothing to us .	103.33528543637613
Our distress , my dear Lizzy , is very great .	131.11876903927
Not that I mean to find fault with you , for such things I know are all chance in this world .	249.65167397249806
I never saw such capacity , and taste , and application , and elegance , as you describe , united .	197.35580582616285
the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice .	619.267539180692
found fault with the arrangement of the furniture , or detected the housemaid in negligence ;	894.1186056925038
How can you contrive to write so even ?	601.1635092782105
that my dear mother had more command over herself ;	829.3927490723505
The two first dances , however , brought a return of distress ;	193.8976927956668
The room in which the ladies sat was backwards .	870.3336165403551
My father's opinion of me does me the greatest honour ;	1104.9932027020927
It may be easily believed , that however little of novelty could be added to their fears , hopes , and conjectures , on this interesting subject , by its repeated discussion , no other could detain them from it long , during the whole of the journey .	311.30233297781047
but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption !	176.3817457518062
The coach , therefore , took them the first stage of their journey , and brought its master back to Longbourn .	183.23430546299213
cried Jane , what do you mean , Sir ?	177.0687273100207
for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Darcy's steward , and of that , I can assure you , he informed me himself .	75.60130801262382
Her figure was elegant , and she walked well ;	290.7540486958054
I have faults enough , but they are not , I hope , of understanding .	113.94166817231203
but she could not approve him ;	210.84027722434092
and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so full of contradictions and varieties , sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance , and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination .	270.0400141590324
Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections ?	280.27282105934927
CHAPTER I It is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune , must be in want of a wife .	70.04162617937432
I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then Georgiana , unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me .	193.91597112425083
It is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married , continued her mother , but at the same time , Bingley , it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me .	54.73256378955577
And in the first place , let us hear what has happened to you all , since you went away .	41.54471214965196
Besides , it will not much signify what one wears this summer , after the shire have left Meryton , and they are going in a fortnight .	193.69366020494607
His debts are to be paid , amounting , I believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her , and his commission purchased .	159.04935497208987
He dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday .	206.89267484729794
Her mother's ungraciousness , made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind ;	252.64262921715238
But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes .	210.69436890572538
You are rather disposed to call his interference officious ?	797.6299828982561
and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go , she did not seem to ask for compassion .	137.14745663155892
Whilst wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and Elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of Darcy approaching them , and at no great distance .	100.54665896381982
At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here .	405.6979374544997
and it was but the other day , that I recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her .	62.41954550305507
We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side , said Jane : I hope and trust they will yet be happy .	179.4599552429269
that she had a new gown , or a new parasol , which she would have described more fully , but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry , as Forster called her , and they were going to the camp ;	104.5755740648759
If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement , I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one .	223.4798207951681
And pray may I ask ?	313.5001802479741
I should never be happy without him , so think it no harm to be off .	111.02955321881937
have you heard from my uncle ?	279.44785107669856
He repeated the question , with some surprise at her silence .	197.68690962615736
and a report soon followed that Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly .	560.1537907828932
for she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening , although utterly unknown to her before .	212.28359413027033
and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry her , had she been his relation .	58.40502973884385
As for your Elizabeth's picture , you must not attempt to have it taken , for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes ?	385.68463992226833
It would have suited me in every respect .	331.9132227961207
He immediately offered to fetch her others ;	300.2703398957263
I ought not to have said a word about it .	75.07871877171601
His father was an excellent man , said Gardiner .	174.07766006473534
One ought not to repine ;	1327.6273979765842
I cannot catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as I often see done .	163.7632166598766
She was not sorry , however , to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung .	124.4699170169524
the other is Charlotte's marriage .	908.4473492721302
But you How are you ?	222.8673831628642
He danced only four dances , though gentlemen were scarce ;	1105.3019474158777
Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ;	140.8448441369106
Good gracious !	216.59187369776393
I am more likely to want time than courage , Elizabeth .	408.15272638809125
And though he exclaimed at the term , she found that it had been pretty much the case .	200.83088941362172
and continually was she repeating , Why is he so altered ?	1861.0573942883773
You may well warn me against such an evil .	113.17211461035683
They were of course all intending to be surprised ;	174.91856571494378
my head is always full of something else .	278.72932163026655
She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an inmate of Darcy's house , and mentioned with raptures , some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture .	343.25464049611634
This however was no evil to Elizabeth , and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough ;	369.3924514292299
He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before , on his reading Collins's letter ;	192.3718426483587
Jane , cried Elizabeth , was there a servant belonging to it , who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ?	94.7584436776948
They travelled as expeditiously as possible ;	1168.6359014132568
You are a very strange creature by way of a friend !	276.4430469979189
When Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed , which certainly was not unseldom , she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte .	537.221937537363
The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity ;	185.73529951576685
Your tempers are by no means unlike .	1556.4161042000183
and , after receiving her answer , asked in an hesitating manner how long Darcy had been staying there .	208.2831508770098
His being so sure of succeeding , was wrong , said she ;	250.3159886036695
Allow me to say , Lady Catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application , have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged .	197.31447135479957
GARDINER .	1199.003474649507
and before he went away , an engagement was formed , chiefly through his own and Bennet's means , for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband .	119.8792033488966
you cannot go yourself .	1788.112135872886
That Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham , before his arrival , but without gaining any satisfactory information ;	355.46890258497746
They were in fact very fine ladies ;	371.8676894269906
Well , any friend of Bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure ;	433.53859599084444
Come , let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly .	357.66654353402873
I am , dear Sir , c .	73.2672243262033
or , as the happiest alternative , been secluded from the world , in some distant farm house .	495.44391042728915
And how impossible in others !	2146.6055637687896
but of the truth of what I shall relate , I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity .	199.91286570595778
Nay , if you are so serious about it , I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled .	211.10016873617178
Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity , a warmth , a delight , which words could but poorly express .	932.3664029859802
At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ;	97.75232353228138
but from what the report of their engagement could originate , Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ;	217.0484868454681
my dear brother , replied Bennet , that is exactly what I could most wish for .	121.56995027711265
Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude , but said nothing .	152.17785954165967
it is very hard to think that she might have been Collins's wife by this time , had not it been for her own perverseness .	145.02085855117917
He could not speak a word for full ten minutes .	144.22576906797926
If this be the case , he deserves you .	296.5832031085716
His attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect ;	1306.2827981299777
It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast ;	305.43129804112357
I am sure you will be very comfortable there .	78.79718244799527
At length the Parsonage was discernible .	859.7870359815031
so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as your's seems to have been .	668.8039802652123
I am afraid you will be angry .	42.59564308931822
He certainly looked at her friend a great deal , but the expression of that look was disputable .	253.8450688848541
She was less handsome than her brother , but there was sense and good humour in her face , and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle .	154.24521912938377
London : Printed for T Egerton , Military Library , Whitehall .	21.655013287918294
and she parted from him convinced , that whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing .	263.9240857249592
I often tell my other girls they are nothing to her .	198.5854354430193
Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction and a moment's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible , she sat down again , and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion .	251.9209686443698
I am not afraid of you , said he , smilingly .	89.14925760188838
I do not think it is very pretty ;	53.884339135979964
Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he ?	181.23916047660512
1 .	384.9991185797929
but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing , and between herself and Elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to .	81.60901930930201
MY DEAR NIECE , I have just received your letter , and shall devote this whole morning to answering it , as I foresee that a little writing will not comprise what I have to tell you .	267.8635191615582
and , though Kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense , since the disturbers of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended , was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance , by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp .	448.6195367299825
That is capital , added her sister , and they both laughed heartily .	507.03084759900764
Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer , as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces .	257.7937617898397
The girls grieved over such a number of ladies ;	314.98856464051505
said Elizabeth .	359.76065498339705
Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity , are not worth a regret .	447.8199690615316
It is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and interest , for him to be guilty of it .	53.89524944436139
What a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago , would now have been gladly and gratefully received !	372.82795527158567
and I understand from Gardiner , that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all , before she leaves the South .	137.1447929038975
said that she had liked him better when they met in Kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning .	88.85292385850099
We are speaking of music , Madam , said he , when no longer able to avoid a reply .	56.16461527182906
and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you .	63.62385731233246
They are descended on the maternal side , from the same noble line ;	507.34488234364466
And is this all ?	504.38364842911886
They have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression .	357.92318591829064
The boy protested that she should not ;	190.05004738414016
Bennet accepted the challenge , observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements .	910.8522668785214
They have at least that advantage .	288.45508651130996
It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge ;	110.51753803214191
My father began life in the profession which your uncle , Philips , appears to do so much credit to but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late Darcy , and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property .	124.87451231868279
That will not do for a compliment to Darcy , Caroline , cried her brother because he does not write with ease .	76.18572909503659
Adieu .	12712.763300512592
you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner .	1000.3413942911368
but intricate characters are the most amusing .	346.3556048284458
grieved shocked .	1940.7960356681845
This , she would not hear of ;	112.42843421076634
It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity ;	455.17149862140707
Hope was over , entirely over ;	1020.7407266266273
F3 .	843.1429980086798
She longed to enquire of the housekeeper , whether her master were really absent , but had not courage for it .	136.3879028192605
Darcy was punctual in his return , and as Lydia informed you , attended the wedding .	303.67179625583816
It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's interested wishes , and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes , however openly or artfully spoken , could influence a young man so totally independent of every one .	367.0768533050575
I will speak to her about it myself directly .	232.17555616776244
Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley ;	382.04453114807393
and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand .	107.7992865956708
The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new , yet I think it is well expressed .	208.21358199076414
The supposition did not pain her .	618.1995348290463
Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense .	228.6304910848843
The latter was thinking only of his breakfast .	256.28711909817156
Their father then went to the library to write , and the girls walked into the breakfast-room .	162.1146863747823
and then , what do you think we did ?	83.84045847031332
he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it ;	223.34429343792982
and , after a pause of several minutes , was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion , who , in a manner , which though it spoke compassion , spoke likewise restraint , said , I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing , concern .	154.07875067789342
and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added , I have never had a cross word from him in my life , and I have known him ever since he was four years old .	99.83994774861758
Wherever you and Jane are known , you must be respected and valued ;	657.9345805956323
but Darcy can please where he chuses .	532.9206820440706
Only think of that my dear ;	118.3173510015895
and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room , its aspect and its furniture , he addressed himself particularly to her , as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him .	103.42200454363197
They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends , and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family , when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window , and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle , driving up the street .	89.88639046606093
But it ought to be done , and if you will give me a sheet of paper , it shall be done directly .	33.958815302466924
The least agreeable circumstance in the business , was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet , whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person .	310.1171969755917
And that , said Reynolds , pointing to another of the miniatures , is my master and very like him .	259.40611405719955
I should not be surprised , said Darcy , if he were to give it up , as soon as any eligible purchase offers .	85.37451755780768
I thought him very sly ;	426.3898861643579
When is your turn to come ?	568.9287108788092
'Lady Catherine , ' said she , 'you have given me a treasure .	341.79934272871105
I shall never forget her appearance this morning .	232.04581884615538
But no , recollecting herself , that could never be : my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me : I should not have been allowed to invite them .	69.85187136494471
We passed each other several times .	509.6363468603727
When they all removed to Brighton , therefore , you had no reason , I suppose , to believe them fond of each other .	85.36235191564037
Her reflections were in general satisfactory .	1476.6293251390027
The officers will find women better worth their notice .	681.6158677063452
E2 .	7036.6709905557955
Let us sit down .	281.7585921797018
With your good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others !	251.506396648568
While Sir William was with them , Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig , and shewing him the country ;	477.0477153223026
she felt all the compliment it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother .	69.51125899157519
You have sense , and we all expect you to use it .	303.788182329459
Their other engagements were few ;	1226.682156641844
Change of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home , may be as useful as anything .	771.7561548750799
Oh yes !	770.8742810030951
I often think , said she , that there is nothing so bad as parting with one's friends .	131.9086879265394
Mary had neither genius nor taste ;	2322.28236240376
1813 .	662.9770795749859
You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner in such society ;	384.0455688730503
and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character , in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of Elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end .	256.6877937363018
Elizabeth , for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts , now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since her coming away .	149.8301673132479
repeated Bennet .	2708.2997600520134
but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment , had they sat in one equally lively ;	150.8709354112983
Oh !	298.0706733468098
She paused , and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse .	819.361648464508
And to be kept back on such a motive !	279.65312576728326
