Average perplexity: 1552.329550422511
I am not at all afraid of her dying .	254.16448487368658
and so accomplished !	1835.799743350408
but without scheming to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery .	338.7438880177746
She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest , by talking of their supposed marriage , and planning his happiness in such an alliance .	597.4116923705134
Hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was very glad ;	415.9910263040411
I told you in the library , you know , that I should never speak to you again , and you will find me as good as my word .	87.11847454422785
The house , furniture , neighbourhood , and roads , were all to her taste , and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most friendly and obliging .	332.5459147754167
and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle directly .	423.6193122630448
If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection , Elizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty .	1717.7772681344068
My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness , and in a cause of such moment as this , I shall certainly not depart from it .	485.6169637861804
The pain of separation , however , might be alleviated on his side , by preparations for the reception of his bride , as he had reason to hope , that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire , the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men .	141.51545527784666
No , I thank you ;	276.10697541756605
I have suspected it some time , but I am now convinced .	192.12669864268807
Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again , and weakened her disgust of Collins .	2071.8568745621756
It was unpardonable .	1086.8669301699783
No , said Colonel Fitzwilliam , that is an advantage which he must divide with me .	289.37029956202605
and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the probability of a rainy season , made her feel that the commonest , dullest , most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker .	286.04015597819006
Their visitors staid with them above half an hour , and when they arose to depart , Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing and Gardiner , and Miss Bennet , to dinner at Pemberley , before they left the country .	121.87527899296202
But upon my honour I do not .	747.0109272957203
She blushed , and Jane blushed ;	1513.517191513428
I promised them so faithfully !	2540.8337844707235
which are naturally lively enough .	16492.94151097474
It was a subject , in short , on which reflection would be long indulged , and must be unavailing .	203.95762880962343
The rooms were lofty and handsome , and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor ;	1327.8746553826575
and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour Lady Lucas .	284.62062337182914
but Darcy , at whom it was all aimed , was still inflexibly studious .	876.8487963639336
What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosing's Park , when he put his letter into her hand !	738.2924925792821
Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas , for Collins was only a clergyman ;	262.45529171525726
The Collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave ;	1441.5493604585606
Do you consider the forms of introduction , and the stress that is laid on them , as nonsense ?	414.25863384478106
As for Jane , her anxiety under this suspence was , of course , more painful than Elizabeth's ;	645.5531501937794
Indeed !	2916.802402273886
and I particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at Netherfield , '_She a beauty !	487.26353709958215
I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well , I assure you .	284.22493214562394
and , perhaps , if I have very good luck , I may meet with another Collins in time .	247.12914245978826
From herself to Jane from Jane to Bingley , her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Darcy's explanation there , had appeared very insufficient ;	545.3378800114227
My father , however , is partial to Wickham .	165.73106836179096
The dejection was almost universal .	3694.641779180949
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper ;	314.5526887788946
But in spite of all this fine talking , my dear Lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured , that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair .	159.42697706012964
No why should he ?	3548.6794926692396
As Gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she and her children should go to London , at the same time that Bennet came from it .	125.29432190730608
Yet , how just a humiliation !	1870.2010079032652
Nay , when I read a letter of his , I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham , much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law .	513.1361367742633
Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ?	585.5154255184707
Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and which he thought the prettiest ?	284.65554801543755
In the afternoon , the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves ;	91.5445916554357
He has children of his own , and may have more .	299.3439661021091
Family pride , and filial pride , for he is very proud of what his father was , have done this .	483.636240591484
It was to this effect : Since writing the above , dearest Lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ;	559.1549516652105
Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield , which was fixed for the following Tuesday .	299.2292538339833
This was his plan of amends of atonement for inheriting their father's estate ;	1997.8049723854654
and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached .	403.83798869415114
If you will thank me , he replied , let it be for yourself alone .	235.7329174577036
I hope he will overlook it .	856.9520348125935
Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her .	715.1869965991685
that he should have been in love with her for so many months !	142.12752766862832
She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting .	221.0942894416297
and as she considered that Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations , and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct , she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before .	202.58530567840427
Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again ?	468.6793029962985
She was ashamed to think how much .	349.4932851840654
Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends ?	344.5640470348644
She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference .	258.9549644422335
1813 .	2460.563970389588
Do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart .	342.89975178619045
and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer !	557.5284833968506
Did you , on reading it , give any credit to its contents ?	504.48257598833504
When tea was over , Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table but in vain .	1090.8084091626138
Yes , he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word .	589.2529920643984
and Elizabeth found , that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations' consent , there was still something to be wished for .	191.31086203169735
and neither the carriage , nor the livery of the servant who preceded it , were familiar to them .	678.0731167614974
Oh , well !	1309.459501763541
for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ;	592.3450427754616
Is nothing due to me on that score ?	2647.5399743605594
but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter and said , Jane , I congratulate you .	77.89183431402617
Bennet's best comfort was , that Bingley must be down again in the summer .	994.2273522636715
and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , I never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them .	417.048539678442
The park paling was still the boundary on one side , and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground .	330.32754707468774
Jane certainly could not come back .	1850.3485361424728
To the civil enquiries which then poured in , and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Bingley's , she could not make a very favourable answer .	254.18850228741158
He begged pardon for having displeased her .	1833.2146844671652
But she is nothing to me now .	291.6991306044147
Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time .	667.3437548739396
Miss Darcy , on her brother's entrance , exerted herself much more to talk ;	386.76582720680574
He made no answer , and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton .	81.69181942071818
the nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people !	3270.1864889165845
If , indeed , it should be so !	304.5618316073603
I cannot fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation .	371.44241378402495
He had rather hoped that all his wife's views on the stranger would be disappointed ;	674.2422988915719
CHAPTER XVI .	1145.7134424904657
Her report was highly favourable .	5871.878189329779
Every body said how well she looked ;	983.0729078420089
He seemed scarcely to hear her , and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation ;	314.1329894541726
They were now almost at the door of the house , for she had walked fast to get rid of him ;	145.3052127357294
He is so excessively handsome !	1147.6684858619212
for Long has just been here , and she told me all about it .	279.2020951093141
where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure ;	610.2939491928059
Darcy , after enquiring of her how and Gardiner did , a question which she could not answer without confusion , said scarcely any thing .	202.78836600170408
They gradually ascended for half a mile , and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence , where the wood ceased , and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House , situated on the opposite side of a valley , into which the road with some abruptness wound .	458.1791547792976
He was too happy , however , to need much attention ;	250.03403208763328
Why Jane you never dropt a word of this ;	3327.7288835702952
It was all pride and insolence .	763.1256685798404
How does Georgiana get on , Darcy ?	2275.34224625353
At such a distance as that , you know , things are strangely misrepresented .	582.8095429868429
and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted .	658.3489244671209
We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured .	469.95176821579344
pray make haste and come into the dining-room , for there is such a sight to be seen !	441.0660595616109
When they were gone , Elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent .	189.78197848169367
My dear Eliza he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way .	176.8201674155695
Her ease and good spirits increased .	1894.992280146799
Elizabeth , who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Darcy had been , was much relieved by discerning such different feelings .	499.75950764989307
Oh , yes !	568.1717863466299
, but its volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous locations .	5591.836958196295
Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship , in spite of a great opposition of character .	764.771082065253
said Charlotte , as soon as he was gone .	368.01153053174625
There is also one other person in the party , he continued after a pause , who more particularly wishes to be known to you , Will you allow me , or do I ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton ?	129.94898753617133
When a woman has five grown up daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty .	566.3921088097461
cried his wife impatiently .	3524.0307999508996
Neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude , replied Elizabeth , have any possible claim on me , in the present instance .	556.9574811566266
and addressed herself particularly to Bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation .	171.63422083278383
His manners are very different from his cousin's .	954.0369243646373
But it is so strange !	704.1003664540951
About ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire , to which he belonged .	343.17146495333975
And pray what sort of guardians do you make ?	646.4683130943145
Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in my dressing-room .	1010.3307318546941
Can you possibly guess , Lizzy , who is meant by this ?	766.5084640059133
You may depend upon my not mentioning it .	398.19858382604167
and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs .	369.1160162495541
and to prevent its ever happening again , took care to inform him at first , that it was a favourite haunt of hers .	341.0247912748242
certainly , cried his faithful assistant , no one can be really esteemed accomplished , who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with .	509.0699907526735
He was writing , and , without raising his head , coolly replied , Just as you please .	346.5037521096541
March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford .	3247.595942380888
Bennet was perfectly satisfied ;	775.7062121802672
When the gentlemen rose to go away , Bennet was mindful of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time .	164.42110785178946
that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking Darcy's character , though he had assured her that respect for the father , would always prevent his exposing the son .	428.997635757091
His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost .	597.0101125742818
I have not the smallest hope .	548.261378945131
She coloured as she spoke ;	1831.88258870412
She opened the door , and met Maria in the landing place , who , breathless with agitation , cried out , Oh , my dear Eliza !	209.33787254564803
There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed .	852.1888615202682
You shall hear what she says .	384.6485688688383
I do not see what right Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend's inclination , or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy .	175.41217666778664
A few weeks , he believed .	885.6969199949489
But think no more of the letter .	430.02144754910796
When is your next ball to be , Lizzy ?	905.5298714808276
You see how continually we are engaged there .	1463.4665891704346
Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours ;	4607.122491326237
You know I always speak my mind , and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves .	288.2804998073734
See paragraph 1 .	14072.667101451088
I am happier even than Jane ;	909.9158951989181
but it must be done soon .	464.63444851408843
they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence ;	1028.9331029342475
if it must be so , it must .	961.453396094134
I should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match , cried Elizabeth .	116.38060032164519
She followed her father to the fire place , and they both sat down .	313.27943804803914
We have judged it best , that my niece should be married from this house , of which I hope you will approve .	204.19124071698494
and , after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable composure .	243.24595572223953
Yes , she will remain there till Christmas .	818.2481131503176
Special rules , set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license , apply to copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark .	596.4916905476384
and Gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing , by the servant's account , that their niece was taken suddenly ill ;	559.3384846490101
Remember , Eliza , that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do .	990.3071499989976
but I think I shall like your husband quite as well as Jane's .	236.2934185896987
I do not think we were speaking at all .	250.40830072239797
Well , cried her mother , it is all very right ;	148.46502560953607
and Hurst , principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings , joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss Bennet .	659.6841219312865
Yet he is such a man !	383.90784460789615
You have delighted us long enough .	1185.0415451123195
Bennet could hardly contain herself .	1573.8648750576729
Be that as it may , she saw him go with regret ;	1673.0437270060552
She had even learnt to detect , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary .	837.1804859801616
dear me !	45459.21032859373
when it was no longer likely they should meet .	710.2239013550771
but with the rich , he is liberal-minded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and perhaps agreeable , allowing something for fortune and figure .	450.2697100070766
and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him .	894.5142787567783
You blamed me for coming ?	2861.0238816485285
Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield ;	1258.2664312133265
and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look .	261.37728446643496
Have you any idea , Lizzy , who this gentleman is ?	290.6364612290096
It was not in her nature , however , to increase her vexations , by dwelling on them .	160.73146844302443
and even Darcy acknowledged , that the partridges were remarkably well done ;	912.8807016699136
There is something very pompous in his style .	700.003664746624
You certainly do , she replied with a smile ;	750.5321672448387
and though Collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as I have often told her , to come to Rosings every day , and play on the piano-forte in Jenkinson's room .	209.80153740500793
Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to conciliate her .	472.9217755464106
and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet .	151.0948263173465
They contained no actual complaint , nor was there any revival of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering .	2735.5469812441897
Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage ;	730.3193773786038
Kitty was the only one who shed tears ;	1213.5112520455486
And then you have added so much to it yourself , you are always buying books .	462.3446750631153
This cannot be !	635.1805268550667
and Elizabeth , who knew what curiosities his letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise .	458.27654679207365
When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer , I made a point of her having two men servants go with her .	516.5865252541561
Elizabeth , on her side , had much to do .	200.1507453092081
The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a headache ;	1848.1733766713628
Indeed , Jane , you ought to believe me .	162.6640617078751
And so would Anne , if her health had allowed her to apply .	704.2486569677561
I will read it to you When my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to London , might be concluded in three or four days , but as we are certain it cannot be so , and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town , he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel .	171.3453935458987
They entered it in one of its lowest points , and drove for some time through a beautiful wood , stretching over a wide extent .	944.7490625877055
May we take my uncle's letter to read to her ?	4656.222958819647
When the card tables were placed , he had an opportunity of obliging her in return , by sitting down to whist .	164.51611951453452
After a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display .	285.8937438890929
but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands .	466.93715187356236
he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and that , if he marry prudently , his wife may teach him .	904.9627415429858
and Bennet , for many years after Lydia's birth , had been certain that he would .	213.89685574222716
and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements , new carriages and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield , in the course of three or four months .	250.49271937218228
hatred had vanished long ago , and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him , that could be so called .	412.7734028758367
But I will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well .	364.4077106567765
If his own vanity , however , did not mislead him , he was the cause , his pride and caprice were the cause of all that Jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer .	164.19096539359472
I fancy , Lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all .	377.36661698874525
Their affectionate mother shared all their grief ;	4424.318223066448
a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room .	214.13709918257655
Pray , how violent was Bingley's love ?	2454.807338533854
but Lady Catherine very resolutely , and not very politely , declined eating any thing ;	799.1119601435739
Now what have you to say ?	2585.574961097298
and in front , a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater , but without any artificial appearance .	1269.467357562104
He carved , and ate , and praised with delighted alacrity ;	1510.6322070162435
E5 .	24643.13871439716
But though every thing seemed neat and comfortable , she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance ;	590.1050578233475
When I am in the country , he replied , I never wish to leave it ;	115.29264928740231
It only shews her being deficient in something herself sense or feeling .	2906.023966686947
Yes , very well .	520.8512326858782
and , though she was not very sanguine in expecting it , the application was a something to look forward to .	297.34861358876327
Is this a hint to me , Lizzy , said her father , to send for the horses ?	126.42040654807792
and more than commonly anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her .	516.3671938699672
However , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts , and I am very glad to hear what you tell us , of long sleeves .	145.0478272217439
you know he is , as well as I do ;	620.0807209887753
Pray forgive me , if I have been very presuming , or at least do not punish me so far , as to exclude me from P I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park .	315.3006884445716
Your idea of the ponies is delightful .	2568.078896850333
then recollecting himself , I will not detain you a minute , but let me , or let the servant , go after and Gardiner .	620.7530097272089
In the first place , he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron .	191.00725969722052
but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you .	539.8854564476304
Bennet could not have chosen better .	1220.940737787584
and know them to be so much attached to me !	330.76541873638934
Her sister made not the smallest objection , and the piano-forte was opened , and Darcy , after a few moments recollection , was not sorry for it .	152.02343809766904
Elizabeth was surprised , but said not a word .	170.05464905982174
CHAPTER X More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park , unexpectedly meet Darcy .	671.1401010740482
They have none of them much to recommend them , replied he ;	226.73176693535905
After walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on resuming their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant , there chanced to be a little alteration .	285.41770891179834
and Collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much .	1783.499536489478
and yet it should seem by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy .	135.1855750099723
I dare say you believed it ;	195.6196704465319
You are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on ;	380.75676440535875
nothing , therefore , could be fairly conjectured from that , though Elizabeth , who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings , was perfectly aware , that , had she known nothing of Darcy , she could have borne the dread of Lydia's infamy somewhat better .	224.70508049233098
her voice was weak , and her manner affected .	1990.5390792623953
Would you believe it , Lizzy , that when he went to town last November , he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent , would have prevented his coming down again !	149.64587355000495
he kissed it with affectionate gallantry , though he hardly knew how to look , and they entered the house .	321.897304768857
The particulars , I reserve till we meet .	1071.669015747584
and she looked on the whole scene , the river , the trees scattered on its banks , and the winding of the valley , as far as she could trace it , with delight .	235.07154216158685
It was an animating subject , and Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match .	249.28539955740348
Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ;	352.5559592506861
Neither could any thing be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities which Darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach .	424.1744017544925
She then sought her eldest sister , who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley .	369.62553802130054
From Collins !	15592.380506099118
Will you do me the honour of reading that letter ?	471.71751877620346
So , Lizzy , said he one day , your sister is crossed in love I find .	255.4749539474098
Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately ;	291.92542139568314
There was no want of discourse .	258.8916861784249
His coming into the country at all , is a most insolent thing indeed , and I wonder how he could presume to do it .	211.16639280147442
So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him !	2552.9033426477035
and he was obliged to walk about the room , while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences .	238.69544142145597
How well it sounds .	8067.064089781309
It should not be said , that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers .	103.12623621850234
and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself ;	372.1235403862995
They found Bennet still up .	2893.081988199604
and they conversed with so much spirit and flow , as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself , as well as of Darcy .	216.51622676415292
But it is , returned she ;	824.6233168595445
He shook his head .	1203.9363485585395
His daughter's request , for such it might be considered , of being admitted into her family again , before she set off for the North , received at first an absolute negative .	315.40124215231765
Stop me whilst you can .	8911.947216117826
Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure , and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming , when she found herself so affectionately received .	396.777674615354
Is it possible !	1646.5853450761922
Let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ;	289.90012599615727
He delighted in going to Pemberley , especially when he was least expected .	360.3379870202445
I had no notion but he would go a shooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company .	355.6846640484861
Elizabeth was in agonies .	1059.415021150958
Your uncle is as much surprised as I am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned , would have allowed him to act as he has done .	175.45348984856153
This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted : and Elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away .	313.2035955505672
Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to his wife ?	1832.456353576819
On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects .	444.0788128536201
An express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from Colonel Forster , to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers ;	282.06898500258313
This has been my motive , my fair cousin , and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem .	267.84631884133165
You ought certainly to forgive them as a christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing .	777.9018514106597
I will not encourage the impudence of either , by receiving them at Longbourn .	190.07989640912328
The next morning , however , made an alteration ;	240.57664954824995
Charlotte is an excellent manager , I dare say .	1775.119286356278
It is evident by this , added Jane , that he comes back no more this winter .	213.43334081578297
To be sure that did seem as if he admired her indeed I rather believe he did I heard something about it but I hardly know what something about Robinson .	206.94134650272264
With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ;	898.8006557401493
When she remembered the style of his address , she was still full of indignation ;	379.4407564027517
When first Bennet had married , economy was held to be perfectly useless ;	1507.9261288013631
The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came , and Bennet was forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle , was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth .	141.6018509351888
can it be really so !	5744.124695622331
She had never seen a place for which nature had done more , or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste .	536.539391306403
I hope , added Gardiner , that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her .	433.09538147670844
what can have induced him to behave so cruelly ?	4193.280283905085
Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications .	1513.4263394522698
His eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity ;	903.0179843063099
As soon as all had ate , and the elder ones paid , the carriage was ordered ;	322.818147542714
You know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself .	295.1062069073886
Let me hear what it is .	301.99063139155123
He meant , I believe , replied Jane , to go to Epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the postilions , and try if any thing could be made out from them .	307.1797242527059
observed Bennet .	21041.45517811157
and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible .	177.1325501120453
The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic .	1527.612534925626
My overhearings were more to the purpose than yours , Eliza , said Charlotte .	674.9137853850287
his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had .	329.7090020813981
said Elizabeth .	1244.6008833589985
The first mentioned was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , I had detached Bingley from your sister , and the other , that I had , in defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , ruined the immediate prosperity , and blasted the prospects of Wickham .	181.49126359797546
Darcy is all politeness , said Elizabeth , smiling .	312.7924457183338
said Jane .	1356.9925147887352
It was some days , however , before they received any invitation thither , for while there were visitors in the house , they could not be necessary ;	189.73128397559546
Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth and it was soon done done while Bennet was stirring the fire .	651.9640474931479
I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings , and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three , of whom we shall deprive you .	705.3653987610617
It taught me to hope , said he , as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before .	253.41279604607962
but since then , we have both , I hope , improved in civility .	302.83659363636593
but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him .	179.13590177369596
When Jane and Elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in her praise of Bingley before , expressed to her sister how very much she admired him .	422.2835169159452
There can be no love in all this .	330.85194431616026
Yet it is hard , she sometimes thought , that this poor man cannot come to a house , which he has legally hired , without raising all this speculation !	729.3491923272072
and Bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice .	385.76146289634727
Good heavens !	21429.677260489476
If I had been able , said she , to carry my point of going to Brighton , with all my family , this would not have happened ;	108.7234615931676
Indeed I had .	1044.8597620266785
and in the mean time , she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married , to Hill and the two housemaids .	263.39269438217576
Lydia's being settled in the North , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment ;	514.0023119703839
The younger ones out before the elder are married !	776.2772198919332
My excellent father died about five years ago ;	1427.8196159770287
We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening , said Elizabeth .	451.0078322259511
And if you will stay another month complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London , for I am going there early in June , for a week ;	152.79520999199477
Lizzy , you must not do so .	240.26204723083546
Only look at her .	5351.801981063561
and the Hursts have no horses to theirs .	1677.511875569628
She directly replied , You need not be frightened .	625.9130940603585
How nicely we are crammed in !	4612.4270887221455
The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning's impatience .	1285.2755060050579

Lizzy , when you first read that letter , I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now .	177.9355683929605
but her's she thought was still worse .	2754.4428630182542
and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty .	605.2801060940135
But does Lydia know nothing of this ?	1026.4656574571222
She counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent ;	2029.1206758247465
Can such abominable pride as his , have ever done him good ?	2932.790411978497
Oh !	1413.2826700053927
Good Heaven !	1047.7193320464296
Have all her friends left her ?	4403.966007200239
Their brother , indeed , was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency .	242.26030783189057
The colour which had been driven from her face , returned for half a minute with an additional glow , and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes , as she thought for that space of time , that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken .	424.3842436424403
Pardon me .	1032.2129868216368
My dear , dear Lizzy , I would I do congratulate you but are you certain ?	188.8559629463225
Her father had been an attorney in Meryton , and had left her four thousand pounds .	140.93271342269153
She had fully proposed being engaged by Wickham for those very dances : and to have Collins instead !	1324.373957564904
I am so grieved for him .	375.30797374813613
She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together .	350.6213570650505
no , I certainly am not .	924.4462461890048
You quite mistook Darcy .	5258.294830311438
but this is the true one .	1108.94059080346
Yes , in conjunction with his friend .	476.6614952602992
and still different from either , was what Bennet sent to Collins , in reply to his last .	336.7788719790075
Bingley was every thing that was charming , except the professed lover of her daughter .	369.4661329519696
They repulsed every attempt of Bennet at conversation , and by so doing , threw a languor over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Collins , who was complimenting Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests .	207.1253434182228
As all conversation was thereby at an end , Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room .	682.0686213179396
Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject ;	879.5435713154419
When first he came in , he had spoken to her but little ;	304.3610815688699
If it is designedly done , they cannot be justified ;	770.5927202163605
But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both .	273.48916704319424
and , as they drew near the appointed inn where Bennet's carriage was to meet them , they quickly perceived , in token of the coachman's punctuality , both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs .	421.55334262548257
What , none of you ?	1187.675854725113
Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman , and required information ;	1486.6199309644624
Well , my comfort is , I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done .	102.59492118403502
Too much , I am afraid ;	2049.7545432668635
This was very amiable , but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any conception of ;	706.9007853473234
His family knew him to be on all common occasions , a most negligent and dilatory correspondent , but at such a time , they had hoped for exertion .	461.26794317501384
His first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance , as far as it would go .	120.52558033140168
She wanted to talk , but there seemed an embargo on every subject .	374.60649657406066
In every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived .	727.4791301987811
but on perceiving Darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner .	1905.4218988093126
She was more alive to the disgrace , which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham , a fortnight before they took place .	371.68378391282243
and Gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in London the very next day , and would assist Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia .	165.7883168868022
And then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you ;	320.25236665427815
As for Elizabeth , her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last ;	306.2660242938991
They are not married , nor can I find there was any intention of being so ;	282.7763021642328
for you are really proud of your defects in writing , because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution , which if not estimable , you think at least highly interesting .	643.5472072893468
You never will be able to make both of them good for any thing .	339.62542323002697
They walked towards the Lucases , because Kitty wished to call upon Maria ;	616.6425037638991
But you see that Jane , said her aunt , does not think so ill of Wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt .	51.89705222434395
I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ;	828.7171252662795
it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it .	394.22663789745235
The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend , assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London , might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment .	164.12733891193932
She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either , or make either appear to advantage .	404.62810079036683
You allude perhaps to the entail of this estate .	563.292619519681
She could not win him , however , to any conversation ;	320.6166558389293
by her ease and liveliness , his mind might have been softened , his manners improved , and from his judgment , information , and knowledge of the world , she must have received benefit of greater importance .	336.6825779580113
Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone .	775.8790332745904
I enquired after their brother , of course .	281.69134993606104
Bennet could hardly comprehend it .	2902.6310867359434
and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both .	322.3245132662021
Dear me !	37117.28980497123
by reason , by reflection , by every thing .	1111.3109112655088
to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed , and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation , console herself for the present , and prepare for another disappointment .	255.5323878258488
During dinner , Bennet scarcely spoke at all ;	5348.619709715579
To convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself , was no very difficult point .	368.98486050036195
my daughters are brought up differently .	5739.462396282365
and after listening a moment , she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry , and calling loudly after her .	625.8229621690996
Why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent , said she , did he come at all ?	227.2254064466674
I do think it is the hardest thing in the world , that your estate should be entailed away from your own children ;	216.12530274844042
Bennet treasured up the hint , and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married ;	434.1435772941633
Do you know Bingley ?	994.9396560156537
Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy .	2296.5051185734346
and very unwillingly said so .	1798.5154064061655
Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter ;	628.9355339086972
Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not .	248.1773855130279
He had been some time with Gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river , and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning .	168.03340479880129
He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies , of whose beauty he had heard much ;	277.8516683965568
Good God !	21429.677260489476
Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever .	280.68060110278617
Something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them , but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life .	178.5493385362144
it came from Netherfield , and was opened immediately .	311.7517354562632
They have each their advantages , and I can be equally happy in either .	608.7168252668841
She was wild to be at home to hear , to see , to be upon the spot , to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her , in a family so deranged ;	386.898678888027
In making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self-reproach .	260.1890675274397
CHAPTER I Elizabeth , as they drove along , watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation ;	678.1381655222634
Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance ;	404.6096740033902
And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton , of whom I shall subjoin a list , according to his information .	426.8202627979616
But make a virtue of it by all means .	880.6177179407539
Arguments are too much like disputes .	4033.3642849752746
I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , Lizzy ?	307.91731349698796
The rest of the evening passed with the appearance , on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no farther attempt to distinguish Elizabeth ;	197.9218683427969
I believe , Ma'am , I may safely promise you never to dance with him .	190.67561063757566
No , no .	607.4566967328018
and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least .	393.61827275785043
At length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself .	162.66700217396263
She followed him with her eyes , envied every one to whom he spoke , had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee ;	326.8464560012133
I never saw such a long chin in my life .	286.4689468427884
I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield .	198.18283061965323
cried Elizabeth ;	1186.6353832673042
but this was all lost upon me .	857.8344337437137
No , Kitty , I have at last learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it .	170.4029574517849
The principal purport of his letter was to inform them , that Wickham had resolved on quitting the Militia .	199.0088499889569
I shall be very fit to see Jane which is all I want .	336.6726110009501
When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford , every eye was in search of the Parsonage , and every turning expected to bring it in view .	343.5495747984542
her complexion has no brilliancy ;	10418.745858808878
said her mother as soon as she was in the hall .	228.08579909957587
They will join me early to-morrow , he continued , and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you , Bingley and his sisters .	383.9018667011367
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity .	688.2540541411537
I do not mind his not talking to Long , said Miss Lucas , but I wish he had danced with Eliza .	215.3159398617119
but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder .	377.7047306842798
Yes , there can ;	554.2147360718404
If you received the work electronically , the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund .	197.04117406102105
Make haste , make haste .	312.8254849557887
My reasons for believing it are briefly these : It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance , or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable .	485.7250655259312
After amusing himself some time with their curiosity , he thus explained .	1772.539371921416
I had not believed it possible .	517.1419110536002
Forgive me ;	1126.014019586861
This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself .	514.6381981715855
Darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say something indistinctly of his concern , and observe her in compassionate silence .	383.19250378821994
At length there was nothing more to be said ;	341.85582065720126
Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ;	2233.7667280326013
She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room .	607.1289158575652
But at least it shews , that she was serious in the object of her journey .	249.0086906172971
but , exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone .	2279.479430044862
Elizabeth quietly answered Undoubtedly ;	5270.5734230948865
Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic ;	3848.8326737638
You must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course .	161.560064657288
I can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ;	429.08245871643885
Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming .	1378.5966356855513
I dare say she will ;	304.4841532005727
But self , though it would intrude , could not engross her .	672.2163016816233
His temptation is not adequate to the risk .	3055.016869643135
a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point , without being resented .	1160.6345841900477
Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal from the shire , as clearly as Gardiner could do .	375.58394448280853
To Bennet's acknowledgments he briefly replied , with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family ;	379.2346934614614
When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned , in terms of such mortifying , yet merited reproach , her sense of shame was severe .	205.36186157728523
He is now gone into the army , she added , but I am afraid he has turned out very wild .	125.74591890440875
and , after giving each of them an hasty kiss , hurried into the vestibule , where Jane , who came running down stairs from her mother's apartment , immediately met her .	445.10410676320555
Take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one .	820.5653432352832
I am most seriously displeased .	1140.7297068841956
When they ascended the steps to the hall , Maria's alarm was every moment increasing , and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm .	427.8601119587052
My feelings will not be repressed .	1323.1549645528676
Nor was Darcy's vindication , though grateful to her feelings , capable of consoling her for such discovery .	475.7114448496883
All that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds , secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ;	303.4115391897558
My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other .	1160.6536470535293
She has known him only a fortnight .	621.4319171979573
I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being .	299.15030695819814
and Elizabeth , as they waited for the housekeeper , had leisure to wonder at her being where she was .	118.42732457375625
Elizabeth , though expecting no less , thanked him with tears of gratitude ;	618.7801842137821
I am sick of them all .	194.12953699000124
You shall not , for the sake of one individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that selfishness is prudence , and insensibility of danger , security for happiness .	241.95336250685352
Elizabeth now began to revive .	1410.833202725565
She received him with her very best politeness , which he returned with as much more , apologising for his intrusion , without any previous acquaintance with her , which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice .	168.92642269433003
Very nonsensical to come at all !	6187.177628020857
Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to identify , do copyright research on , transcribe and proofread public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm collection .	969.5904973780894
From that moment I observed my friend's behaviour attentively ;	5946.774477658036
One enjoyment was certain that of suitableness as companions ;	4297.847120243201
And if I am that choice , why may not I accept him ?	541.1102257853928
D The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you can do with this work .	670.1443009270499
Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival , that Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine ;	146.46706719989027
Elizabeth smiled .	3438.5802500700916
Such doings discomposed Bennet exceedingly .	13796.689309824871
My sister , who is more than ten years my junior , was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew , Colonel Fitzwilliam , and myself .	149.42336086161225
It suddenly struck her that it might be from lady Catherine ;	553.3861251849415
E8 .	2760.549226625328
Let Wickham be your man .	11796.233966763075
She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it .	434.1933354295164
At last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance of Darcy , with such a smile over the face , as she remembered to have sometimes seen , when he looked at her .	193.63076464312428
and whenever they changed their quarters , either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to , for some little assistance towards discharging their bills .	792.9167335797182
But I must write no more .	569.2409788918491
and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation .	983.4699988513427
Write to me very often , my dear .	1345.7911131887563
She could see him instantly before her , in every charm of air and address ;	285.9668892470233
But , really , I know not what to say .	263.01521667176337
and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it , to Ramsgate ;	612.2620946986073
His plan did not vary on seeing them .	1192.5394000145948
Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ?	617.9452147153435
just enough to make one good sort of man ;	805.3166041277957
and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been ;	1060.683514072969
Poor Jane !	22729.605164296903
The more I see of the world , the more am I dissatisfied with it ;	378.1899230246125
He and his sisters were well , I hope , when you left London .	288.53968435888896
International donations are gratefully accepted , but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States .	716.05460902655
CHAPTER III .	1252.8497184284454
Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect , that the sight of such rooms , so many servants , and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them .	339.6518024280876
Don't keep coughing so , Kitty , for heaven's sake !	2912.980523706934
Under such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief .	511.8840634589839
and at that moment she felt , that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something !	210.65866691314227
Lord , how ashamed I should be of not being married before three and twenty !	1074.2616387349815
She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure .	735.3873559760539
nor could she for many hours , learn to think of it less than incessantly .	199.8683964473734
You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness ;	1330.3452395234874
His consenting to marry her is a proof , I will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking .	268.6382142775824
To-morrow fortnight .	21041.45517811157
but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other , of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that Denny had brought him from London , and that he was to have a lieutenant's commission in the shire .	162.63492364012734
It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way .	334.26079393734574
My youngest of all , is lately married , and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds , walking with a young man , who I believe will soon become a part of the family .	190.64558390064943
They were then , with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance , taken into the house ;	272.4712158152789
But Elizabeth , who had not the least inclination to remain with them , laughingly answered , No , no ;	320.72948590358254
and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement .	932.9446954513156
All field sports were over .	9690.94267725144
My style of writing is very different from yours .	1593.482550581273
c .	2460.563970389588
and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror , Gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power .	502.55668039751924
Thus , we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition .	2199.4066042345266
She wrote even to Jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her former professions of regard .	217.84032870504203
CHAPTER X The day passed much as the day before had done .	652.0201992350015
He merely added , that he should not write again , till he had something of importance to mention .	171.50837026273115
It originated in Gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support , and consequently preferred her husband's .	756.1931872923276
After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with It is your turn to say something now , Darcy .	246.68991657940606
and his commendation of every thing would have touched Bennet's heart , but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property .	434.7002629032088
She comes to us to-day .	1981.8176335751102
I will not tell you what it is .	224.70891276741165
At length however Bennet had no more to say ;	372.4573512444795
The power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor , and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance .	449.7327657435163
Then turning to Bennet , he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon .	1898.6002169107664
The subjection in which his father had brought him up , had given him originally great humility of manner , but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head , living in retirement , and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity .	379.86577013799
From the entrance hall , of which Collins pointed out , with a rapturous air , the fine proportion and finished ornaments , they followed the servants through an anti-chamber , to the room where Lady Catherine , her daughter , and Jenkinson were sitting .	462.36092663139635
and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over .	298.64004615952666
Now , said she , that this first meeting is over , I feel perfectly easy .	353.3478081499263
The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited .	468.18609854855737
After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight , and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear ;	681.4281169967671
What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy ?	627.9195134930795
Lydia was exceedingly fond of him .	647.4204588943468
When coffee was over , Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him ;	802.0420875714789
I do not believe she often sees such at home .	496.69862721719977
A clergyman like you must marry .	1784.3368200648606
But gracious me !	4072.1872520658717
It was agreed to .	355.23111501882596
But she would not be secure .	395.96882642291837
Though I shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ;	1020.2736995434375
You are so strange !	1205.7620127375349
Having resolved to do it without loss of time , as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday , and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment , he set about it in a very orderly manner , with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business .	367.77016004147254
E GARDINER .	45459.21032859373
For my own part , she rejoined , I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her .	338.0144855178656
and in the evening Bennet's invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter .	349.31192432554303
Yes , always , she replied , without knowing what she said , for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , I remember hearing you once say , Darcy , that you hardly ever forgave , that your resentment once created was unappeasable .	187.96084731606044
my sweetest Lizzy !	16643.083445866894
And I think you will agree with me , in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece's .	679.273532157447
Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations ;	1140.716072328492
CHAPTER XVIII .	1145.7134424904657
F6 .	24643.13871439716
that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her , and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening .	213.3751634382428
CHAPTER III .	1252.8497184284454
What a charming amusement for young people this is , Darcy !	904.7814737464907
I remember , as soon as ever I saw him , when he first came into Hertfordshire last year , I thought how likely it was that you should come together .	133.222231421577
But it is all , all too late now .	492.8548942304872
and Bennet found , with amazement and horror , that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter .	754.2555285958869
She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse , but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other , and how formal and cold was their manner , whenever they did .	197.18232826430972
No one who has ever seen you together , can doubt his affection .	897.4325756018011
Elizabeth listened as little as she could , but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name .	365.92183582407836
that it should be equally unreserved was impossible .	922.1557331438124
It is because he will not give himself the trouble .	456.90646705710924
Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself , and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam , Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word I say .	204.29189617312673
He is perfectly well behaved , polite , and unassuming , said her uncle .	649.911955585992
You have reduced him to his present state of poverty , comparative poverty .	1160.7987098936328
Nearly three weeks .	23572.212531507023
Oh !	1413.2826700053927
His appearance was greatly in his favour ;	2183.2610937515446
I have sent for you on an affair of importance .	591.9025775746227
When to these recollections was added the developement of Wickham's character , it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before , were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful .	600.1810624480469
but Ashworth is too far off !	3593.965705967679
She now lost every expectation of pleasure .	1089.8646278362205
Miss Bennet , replied her ladyship , in an angry tone , you ought to know , that I am not to be trifled with .	101.29625011845236
for I consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman .	529.9604576892327
On reaching the spacious lobby above , they were shewn into a very pretty sitting-room , lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below ;	675.0863323636775
You know pretty well , I suppose , what has been done for the young people .	141.8257192644098
At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted .	1054.3217136343071
I never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong .	1137.0005539471517
Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible .	2722.055686942323
Elizabeth silently attended her .	2003.4683532179442
Oh , Jane , take care .	414.53689735177227
Oh !	1413.2826700053927
' But afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time .	1384.6997926560193
She examined into their employments , looked at their work , and advised them to do it differently ;	619.4627150927015
CHAPTER XI .	1145.7134424904657
unless you looked up to him as a superior .	2616.598255837173
I have therefore made up my mind to tell you , that I do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare .	311.43893720309853
and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William , in which she was readily joined by Jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of Collins , and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London .	136.6701676119876
Who do you mean , my dear ?	1303.7647842838398
Though Bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage .	165.7574602215788
how can it affect them ?	2473.7157923889595
They had nothing to accuse him of but pride ;	391.63560790746897
He was coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland : when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey .	236.50592052427677
Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game , except when Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh's being too hot or too cold , or having too much or too little light .	1080.038933759774
but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future .	250.7673413122218

He scarcely ever spoke to her , and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself , were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas , whose civility in listening to him , was a seasonable relief to them all , and especially to her friend .	99.77742590920742
CHAPTER VIII .	1145.7134424904657
When at length they arose to take leave , Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn ;	350.16756172842787
I could see him with perfect indifference , but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of .	139.89013633572247
I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes .	596.2772163351538
and the two , who were most anxiously expected , to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen , were in very good time .	300.54878131895885
No one but Bennet , regretted that their stay would be so short ;	628.1230224546255
Lydia has no brothers to step forward ;	3209.6172867349787
CHAPTER XII .	1145.7134424904657
Well , mamma , said she , when they were all returned to the breakfast room , and what do you think of my husband ?	55.062239004957206
'Tis as good as a Lord !	8935.09010348306
forgive the question are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ?	674.3428207057283
and therefore gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent , his actions were capable of a very different construction ;	193.3676274925902
But what is that to me ?	544.8766109829802
a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade .	1965.9835626075887
To fortune I am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since I am well aware that it could not be complied with ;	215.15142286933298
Girls , can I do any thing for you in Meryton ?	884.1608792308411
[ Illustration : Morning Dress .	709.2657520876403
But the wife of Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation , that she could , upon the whole , have no cause to repine .	177.9060313155007
Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table , and they went up stairs together .	220.13628245025748
Your alliance will be a disgrace ;	1955.3284304726815
I have every reason in the world to think ill of you .	230.9716804646078
Elizabeth immediately recognising the livery , guessed what it meant , and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations , by acquainting them with the honour which she expected .	789.1155100336982
At present , indeed , they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood ;	423.13975565544627
The world has been deceived in that respect ;	733.9822288027194
Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility ;	821.3123854772581
He must write his own sermons ;	1556.6998012161853
which will not be yours till after your mother's decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to .	544.9642512849953
She stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation , and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery .	470.55174514777053
Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ?	333.72742559928906
Miss Darcy's praise occupied the chief of it .	1343.0597522004316
Recovering himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said , Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of .	324.8691163720425
Is her husband , is the son of his late father's steward , to be his brother ?	473.83593111844004
Lady Catherine approached , and , after listening for a few minutes , said to Darcy , Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss , if she practised more , and could have the advantage of a London master .	118.18490401534162
but Sir William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane , who were dancing together .	311.0477647466904
How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell , but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you .	684.507864408796
Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother .	1797.7698356476178
Certainly , replied Elizabeth there are such people , but I hope I am not one of them .	118.78971129840052
See paragraph 1 .	14072.667101451088
I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did .	266.6459950645666
Had his own happiness , however , been the only sacrifice , he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best ;	229.31759135878966
And with a bow to Darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room .	272.9914552387483
She would not betray her trust , I suppose , without bribery and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be found .	337.0362968283635
but they were now necessary , and she assured him with some confusion , of her attachment to Darcy .	186.3331635201477
All was acknowledged , and half the night spent in conversation .	549.9567434830158
If we are ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been , said Elizabeth , and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what Gardiner has done for them , because Wickham has not sixpence of his own .	292.9779434681207
Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father .	2342.5280785309524
Hunsford , near Westerham , Kent , 15th October .	4707.272050964913
Bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from London , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time .	111.57200992309602
and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life .	274.57142701057097
I would keep a pack of foxhounds , and drink a bottle of wine every day .	1137.6620656342172
Now , seriously , what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence ?	862.8258792508318
and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to elope with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ;	418.7102205925824
Must it be so ?	6449.912237119191
These bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had I with greater policy concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified , unalloyed inclination ;	1805.583642436245
I hope she will turn out well .	1099.474117997477
Teaze him laugh at him .	13547.921740422435
She danced four dances with him at Meryton ;	1384.2200442564847
While the contents of the first letter remained on her mind , she was all surprise all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl , whom it was impossible he could marry for money ;	294.37615884846315
Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start , and before he could recover himself enough to speak , she , in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's situation , hastily exclaimed , I beg your pardon , but I must leave you .	356.06154857901555
I know not , Miss Elizabeth , said he , whether Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us , but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it .	127.01885415788755
And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection .	340.7120288784587
Any place would do , of about three or four hundred a year ;	2512.970762044805
The note was immediately dispatched , and its contents as quickly complied with .	908.5909694765106
and when it closed , Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon Charlotte's degree of contentment , to understand her address in guiding , and composure in bearing with her husband , and to acknowledge that it was all done very well .	456.89717209000224
But no letter appeared , and she was completely puzzled .	780.308068355442
This was a lucky idea of mine , indeed !	395.56865044188925
but it is not sound .	614.1598104975051
What is his name ?	1339.4738964703054
Reynolds , either from pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister .	612.259743838594
Her look and manners were open , cheerful and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and I remained convinced from the evening's scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment .	370.6760778344807
Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer , and forced his younger sister to be civil also , and say what the occasion required .	658.8441887044631
Every thing that is charming !	1011.4775785163403
and after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do , which was the more probable from the time of year .	317.7691521031543
Brother-in-law of Wickham !	13213.866920028082
Happy shall I be , when his stay at Netherfield is over !	2660.530767935187
Miss Darcy was tall , and on a larger scale than Elizabeth ;	655.9561189813843
At present we have nothing to guide us .	857.603085258516
The account of his connection with the Pemberley family , was exactly what he had related himself ;	165.81378899819413
Your sisters are engaged , and there is not another woman in the room , whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with .	135.322671423849
When I wrote that letter , replied Darcy , I believed myself perfectly calm and cool , but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit .	222.37527132381214
The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth , as the first .	427.03093061062987
We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Wickham with money .	823.0659778882995
As soon as they had driven from the door , Elizabeth was called on by her cousin , to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings , which , for Charlotte's sake , she made more favourable than it really was .	98.05397584451713
They may wish many things besides his happiness ;	1881.3290470570448
I must conclude , for I cannot be long from my poor mother .	291.19505306434917
cried Elizabeth , brightening up for a moment .	393.38156827601665
But however he did not .	961.1947922031317
Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Hurst or Miss Bingley ;	3178.806044096195
Your friend performs delightfully ;	10056.914202717911
and the valley , here contracted into a glen , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it .	918.7823016828872
They could talk of nothing but officers ;	879.812855360756
Their conduct has been such , replied Elizabeth , as neither you , nor I , nor any body , can ever forget .	404.6795407106494
She had obtained private intelligence that Darcy did not wish for cards ;	821.1137075847944
why is not every body as happy ?	4890.149651458966
nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable .	536.1971448179553
He had never before supposed that , could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter , it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself , as by the present arrangement .	151.9555895443743
Kitty stared at him , and Lydia exclaimed .	1318.279135456033
Elizabeth could not help saying , It is very much to his credit , I am sure , that you should think so .	72.81529060618402
On their being joined by Bingley himself , Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas ;	660.4404756615975
Wickham passed all his youth there , you know .	2047.2589191778454
As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , I shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females .	380.8465606459605
Very little was said by either ;	4951.370003227403
repeated Elizabeth , in utter amazement .	4423.674543546327
her liveliness had been never worse timed .	9213.232551838451
Perhaps it will be as well , if you discourage his coming here so very often .	260.63188895230775
CHAPTER V Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate .	879.247537369826
She retreated from the window , fearful of being seen ;	727.5993583996234
he sustained it however with fortitude , and so far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into conversation with Gardiner .	260.6041735123907
She shared in their attendance on Bennet , and was a great comfort to them , in their hours of freedom .	231.24195014477584
Does he know his real character ?	5890.086855512631
In her kind schemes for Elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam .	1028.487855720269
We shall often meet , I hope , in Hertfordshire .	347.7654761934297
replied Kitty , it looks just like that man that used to be with him before .	1348.1736925497169
If you were to give me forty such men , I never could be so happy as you .	247.75482759232844
She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious , made no other reply to Elizabeth's salutation , than a slight inclination of the head , and sat down without saying a word .	152.51198842351067
He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever , on the occasion .	241.72277176518878
What is to become of us !	375.2575726351951
It was kindly meant .	1308.676003933646
Lydia declared herself satisfied .	7479.174458050795
My sister , I am sure , will not hear of her removal .	236.6553263474189
The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities , though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings ;	552.4340745641912
If it was not for the entail I should not mind it .	230.3049083385182
And then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it .	215.91876936574008
They have some of the finest woods in the country .	659.4723650944873
Oh !	1413.2826700053927
What did you say of me , that I did not deserve ?	307.47534370137294
You forget that I have made no answer .	376.3841556217435
Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility .	388.30783338962635
Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied , Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully .	405.3176790784693
I know not what to think .	319.5397046203109
Bennet could not give her consent , or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , though she talked to Bingley of nothing else , for half an hour ;	239.15106214724292
She knew not what to think , nor how to account for it .	179.36033791119948
So much the better .	391.0952244949331
You wanted me , I know , to say 'Yes , ' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste ;	503.7780806409421
It is admirable !	1130.7851958925899
They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which I cannot wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects .	259.93984524624534
pride he probably had , and if not , it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town , where the family did not visit .	803.8760751842171
But , Lizzy , you can tell us whether it is like or not .	304.15773900262536
and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's dying an old maid .	694.2067966865243
The wisest and the best of men , nay , the wisest and best of their actions , may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke .	354.176703265207
Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper ;	1682.9340499380119
and it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning , and never said a word about it till now .	125.47620615530063
After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room , from the sideboard to the fender , to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London , Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden , which was large and well laid out , and to the cultivation of which he attended himself .	241.54324393354565
I should infinitely prefer a book .	733.1324624167898
but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless Darcy returned within the stated time .	1096.3304062802624
This is not to be borne .	426.30241357281056
Had his first appearance , or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining , been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Darcy , the gardener's expression of surprise , on beholding his master , must immediately have told it .	376.7730579213916
Hurst had therefore nothing to do , but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep .	800.9541870582697
I thought it would never be over ;	380.8257903144884
But if I do not take your likeness now , I may never have another opportunity .	306.0444363333996
Elizabeth made no answer , and walked on , her heart swelling with indignation .	289.209695831723
And do you like her ?	484.17392776799954
It was an evening of no common delight to them all ;	371.0769752329857
I never can be thankful , Bennet , for any thing about the entail .	233.42268951483356
Were the same fair prospect to arise at present , as had flattered them a year ago , every thing , she was persuaded , would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion .	306.21163429818085
He danced only four dances !	2787.425842449432
I have not a doubt of Bingley's sincerity , said Elizabeth warmly ;	254.67523483575997
Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother , on his approaching marriage , were all that was affectionate and insincere .	238.65822669721493
Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort .	1710.1475559198177
He likes to have his own way very well , replied Colonel Fitzwilliam .	461.09106571806075
It was painful , exceedingly painful , to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return .	190.90754990278614
Yes , thought Elizabeth , that would be a delightful scheme , indeed , and completely do for us at once .	125.39432593530566
but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off .	1104.6767937884913
said he hastily , as he opened the door .	374.5641197011287
She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own , but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action , she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage .	321.29355531519786
As often as I can .	1852.6069090466299
If you love Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham , you must be very happy .	151.0371294533821
She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas .	562.0794959967831
Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming , without changing colour .	201.55993065792973
1 .	1666.472257722938
You may depend on it , replied the other , for Nicholls was in Meryton last night ;	208.1553138842974
and she could hardly suppress a smile , at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had revolted , in his offer to herself .	309.7046537704138
I told Collins so before you came .	1253.7859495380515
I knew , said he , that what I wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary .	205.96059579900427
Why did not you seek legal redress ?	952.4621711984639
When they repaired to the dining-room , Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place , which , in all their former parties , had belonged to him , by her sister .	122.04164445329741
It was necessary to laugh , when she would rather have cried .	281.57096754689957
Soon after you left me on Saturday , I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were .	206.59170045315858
but I always speak what I think .	708.9376816047655
And rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had not Collins thus addressed her , When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ;	165.05471028594863
But that is nothing to us .	321.0150567398112
Our distress , my dear Lizzy , is very great .	653.3195809949812
Not that I mean to find fault with you , for such things I know are all chance in this world .	399.3100562585903
I never saw such capacity , and taste , and application , and elegance , as you describe , united .	271.84208902461165
the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice .	1308.6324998982218
found fault with the arrangement of the furniture , or detected the housemaid in negligence ;	1677.469899091262
How can you contrive to write so even ?	791.8084313659054
that my dear mother had more command over herself ;	3123.8885154576797
The two first dances , however , brought a return of distress ;	518.7478316335639
The room in which the ladies sat was backwards .	1529.6996731221373
My father's opinion of me does me the greatest honour ;	2042.2101231488414
It may be easily believed , that however little of novelty could be added to their fears , hopes , and conjectures , on this interesting subject , by its repeated discussion , no other could detain them from it long , during the whole of the journey .	444.8795723134928
but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption !	284.5981101226285
The coach , therefore , took them the first stage of their journey , and brought its master back to Longbourn .	337.1257099039137
cried Jane , what do you mean , Sir ?	317.60767290620197
for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Darcy's steward , and of that , I can assure you , he informed me himself .	114.79394443611773
Her figure was elegant , and she walked well ;	1066.7765177590911
I have faults enough , but they are not , I hope , of understanding .	212.0086028279849
but she could not approve him ;	696.3333151498921
and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so full of contradictions and varieties , sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance , and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination .	317.7240528637426
Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections ?	758.1453857070633
CHAPTER I It is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune , must be in want of a wife .	122.79112512577052
I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then Georgiana , unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me .	270.0103876680731
It is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married , continued her mother , but at the same time , Bingley , it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me .	67.54315538077607
And in the first place , let us hear what has happened to you all , since you went away .	69.57864903445183
Besides , it will not much signify what one wears this summer , after the shire have left Meryton , and they are going in a fortnight .	281.59670780308136
His debts are to be paid , amounting , I believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her , and his commission purchased .	212.6577715952358
He dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday .	332.2283957988031
Her mother's ungraciousness , made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind ;	510.04536238625644
But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes .	307.45633569770007
You are rather disposed to call his interference officious ?	1140.653964102992
and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go , she did not seem to ask for compassion .	271.8726841724021
Whilst wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and Elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of Darcy approaching them , and at no great distance .	177.49263531323786
At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here .	952.2612018599146
and it was but the other day , that I recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her .	89.8520931156474
We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side , said Jane : I hope and trust they will yet be happy .	288.5769726698637
that she had a new gown , or a new parasol , which she would have described more fully , but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry , as Forster called her , and they were going to the camp ;	166.04508371853103
If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement , I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one .	367.77274557316093
And pray may I ask ?	1148.1725578567068
I should never be happy without him , so think it no harm to be off .	248.07672631419217
have you heard from my uncle ?	1505.925957498569
He repeated the question , with some surprise at her silence .	612.6982754762778
and a report soon followed that Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly .	763.7181807268239
for she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening , although utterly unknown to her before .	292.5996423244274
and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry her , had she been his relation .	75.52873759130648
As for your Elizabeth's picture , you must not attempt to have it taken , for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes ?	498.0214469009024
It would have suited me in every respect .	495.2409696066376
He immediately offered to fetch her others ;	1136.9620676261243
I ought not to have said a word about it .	167.5372827352301
His father was an excellent man , said Gardiner .	569.4495256300519
One ought not to repine ;	4455.157058767711
I cannot catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as I often see done .	318.36808010227656
She was not sorry , however , to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung .	165.46139456837392
the other is Charlotte's marriage .	5612.845462101533
But you How are you ?	916.7930663208325
He danced only four dances , though gentlemen were scarce ;	1842.3904134424904
Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ;	249.2015170629933
Good gracious !	875.8569087426409
I am more likely to want time than courage , Elizabeth .	741.2902429056676
And though he exclaimed at the term , she found that it had been pretty much the case .	416.5300520205962
and continually was she repeating , Why is he so altered ?	2514.0703939322393
You may well warn me against such an evil .	328.24498183538043
They were of course all intending to be surprised ;	448.1890979563214
my head is always full of something else .	1496.4556028707723
She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an inmate of Darcy's house , and mentioned with raptures , some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture .	459.7017334171101
This however was no evil to Elizabeth , and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough ;	859.8287890191403
He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before , on his reading Collins's letter ;	428.62816958163256
Jane , cried Elizabeth , was there a servant belonging to it , who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ?	154.8825456084009
They travelled as expeditiously as possible ;	3895.9939886575803
You are a very strange creature by way of a friend !	608.7201224786814
When Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed , which certainly was not unseldom , she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte .	752.042025320431
The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity ;	236.66913632655175
Your tempers are by no means unlike .	3594.902769748797
and , after receiving her answer , asked in an hesitating manner how long Darcy had been staying there .	386.3920944886727
His being so sure of succeeding , was wrong , said she ;	626.4670924317461
Allow me to say , Lady Catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application , have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged .	219.89203110984562
GARDINER .	24643.13871439716
and before he went away , an engagement was formed , chiefly through his own and Bennet's means , for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband .	193.3687240776677
you cannot go yourself .	16151.244259047833
That Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham , before his arrival , but without gaining any satisfactory information ;	814.0919473774735
They were in fact very fine ladies ;	950.239103380818
Well , any friend of Bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure ;	642.1900574465991
Come , let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly .	594.0385222278305
I am , dear Sir , c .	277.9726421884211
or , as the happiest alternative , been secluded from the world , in some distant farm house .	896.2557701093158
And how impossible in others !	4271.685413734135
but of the truth of what I shall relate , I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity .	318.69949381635723
Nay , if you are so serious about it , I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled .	351.9395451926095
Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity , a warmth , a delight , which words could but poorly express .	2237.0796174515785
At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ;	132.19602114169567
but from what the report of their engagement could originate , Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ;	433.1711966160892
my dear brother , replied Bennet , that is exactly what I could most wish for .	178.01947011163585
Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude , but said nothing .	293.7052965471363
it is very hard to think that she might have been Collins's wife by this time , had not it been for her own perverseness .	174.01493353102347
He could not speak a word for full ten minutes .	348.153241956272
If this be the case , he deserves you .	1010.8187947094002
His attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect ;	2273.255907119008
It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast ;	886.9486568552248
I am sure you will be very comfortable there .	218.34889606368827
At length the Parsonage was discernible .	1148.414736344773
so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as your's seems to have been .	1922.4569251347448
I am afraid you will be angry .	145.9303517140853
He certainly looked at her friend a great deal , but the expression of that look was disputable .	414.88393217954734
She was less handsome than her brother , but there was sense and good humour in her face , and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle .	198.40396872620133
London : Printed for T Egerton , Military Library , Whitehall .	42.011665913909816
and she parted from him convinced , that whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing .	440.05081540981627
I often tell my other girls they are nothing to her .	412.51305052117436
Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction and a moment's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible , she sat down again , and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion .	292.58288880732533
I am not afraid of you , said he , smilingly .	126.87477220311685
I do not think it is very pretty ;	163.25180278828935
Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he ?	369.532401810005
1 .	1666.472257722938
but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing , and between herself and Elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to .	138.34828889057863
MY DEAR NIECE , I have just received your letter , and shall devote this whole morning to answering it , as I foresee that a little writing will not comprise what I have to tell you .	354.7818696639729
and , though Kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense , since the disturbers of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended , was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance , by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp .	495.22508175736385
That is capital , added her sister , and they both laughed heartily .	642.6904937529889
Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer , as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces .	447.88204742740453
The girls grieved over such a number of ladies ;	940.5872686649038
said Elizabeth .	1244.6008833589985
Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity , are not worth a regret .	1124.8992757173562
It is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and interest , for him to be guilty of it .	92.20097903243861
What a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago , would now have been gladly and gratefully received !	464.4729710549346
and I understand from Gardiner , that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all , before she leaves the South .	197.85065946805787
said that she had liked him better when they met in Kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning .	182.0986763429826
We are speaking of music , Madam , said he , when no longer able to avoid a reply .	118.51377427298446
and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you .	141.26388792736424
They are descended on the maternal side , from the same noble line ;	738.6439125995151
And is this all ?	2233.5422962984253
They have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression .	778.6592141050955
The boy protested that she should not ;	728.5905829158313
Bennet accepted the challenge , observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements .	1441.307853954583
They have at least that advantage .	1176.894606559303
It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge ;	150.17748265335385
My father began life in the profession which your uncle , Philips , appears to do so much credit to but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late Darcy , and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property .	174.37210104721512
That will not do for a compliment to Darcy , Caroline , cried her brother because he does not write with ease .	154.73376889189947
Adieu .	88318.47883794032
you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner .	2964.4640150504592
but intricate characters are the most amusing .	1404.436097975729
grieved shocked .	21041.45517811157
This , she would not hear of ;	422.04768753112853
It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity ;	805.4867363877966
Hope was over , entirely over ;	4927.512769668781
F3 .	2810.542737608984
She longed to enquire of the housekeeper , whether her master were really absent , but had not courage for it .	228.8987758176024
Darcy was punctual in his return , and as Lydia informed you , attended the wedding .	635.5840579767407
It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's interested wishes , and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes , however openly or artfully spoken , could influence a young man so totally independent of every one .	535.0626537273171
I will speak to her about it myself directly .	672.6303293277005
Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley ;	851.6688701964146
and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand .	229.84367101559135
The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new , yet I think it is well expressed .	372.1141136051897
The supposition did not pain her .	2239.9873263366576
Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense .	376.5065914115903
The latter was thinking only of his breakfast .	712.1715224108966
Their father then went to the library to write , and the girls walked into the breakfast-room .	337.0454648006631
and then , what do you think we did ?	200.2464912478248
he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it ;	447.0688291470231
and , after a pause of several minutes , was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion , who , in a manner , which though it spoke compassion , spoke likewise restraint , said , I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing , concern .	193.0002129936348
and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added , I have never had a cross word from him in my life , and I have known him ever since he was four years old .	142.35227248677685
Wherever you and Jane are known , you must be respected and valued ;	1368.4035171319952
but Darcy can please where he chuses .	1856.9968280373662
Only think of that my dear ;	308.2859429308058
and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room , its aspect and its furniture , he addressed himself particularly to her , as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him .	149.15140089439058
They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends , and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family , when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window , and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle , driving up the street .	119.76062899538498
But it ought to be done , and if you will give me a sheet of paper , it shall be done directly .	66.5546852820635
The least agreeable circumstance in the business , was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet , whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person .	504.65859844832835
And that , said Reynolds , pointing to another of the miniatures , is my master and very like him .	520.8281726025672
I should not be surprised , said Darcy , if he were to give it up , as soon as any eligible purchase offers .	117.11285544487004
I thought him very sly ;	869.6037665291118
When is your turn to come ?	2652.0669559896437
'Lady Catherine , ' said she , 'you have given me a treasure .	1192.1808882015591
I shall never forget her appearance this morning .	633.866821283839
But no , recollecting herself , that could never be : my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me : I should not have been allowed to invite them .	119.0768796057576
We passed each other several times .	2466.4583270417556
When they all removed to Brighton , therefore , you had no reason , I suppose , to believe them fond of each other .	142.7380135549183
Her reflections were in general satisfactory .	3247.7149386282267
The officers will find women better worth their notice .	1968.5613260427272
E2 .	24643.13871439716
Let us sit down .	1133.443623761399
With your good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others !	500.44083168522474
While Sir William was with them , Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig , and shewing him the country ;	954.7885779034275
she felt all the compliment it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother .	130.04337562624582
You have sense , and we all expect you to use it .	709.4637754486038
Their other engagements were few ;	2381.3433011241464
Change of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home , may be as useful as anything .	1307.6998145330522
Oh yes !	7473.448141722056
I often think , said she , that there is nothing so bad as parting with one's friends .	256.7312616946378
Mary had neither genius nor taste ;	3303.5480666969174
1813 .	2460.563970389588
You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner in such society ;	692.8330386510097
and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character , in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of Elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end .	297.96604091096646
Elizabeth , for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts , now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since her coming away .	239.53459933166624
repeated Bennet .	37117.28980497123
but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment , had they sat in one equally lively ;	234.09260591745698
Oh !	1413.2826700053927
She paused , and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse .	1087.927655677427
And to be kept back on such a motive !	603.2991273240339
