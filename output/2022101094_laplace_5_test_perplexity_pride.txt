Average perplexity: 10396.345983521427
I am not at all afraid of her dying .	6351.1188940204975
and so accomplished !	10636.193261315175
but without scheming to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery .	8569.016791915035
She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest , by talking of their supposed marriage , and planning his happiness in such an alliance .	8576.202058742027
Hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was very glad ;	11116.234143621632
I told you in the library , you know , that I should never speak to you again , and you will find me as good as my word .	7453.279953063016
The house , furniture , neighbourhood , and roads , were all to her taste , and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most friendly and obliging .	8673.149401496128
and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle directly .	7108.58234576142
If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection , Elizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty .	9399.608486238707
My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness , and in a cause of such moment as this , I shall certainly not depart from it .	8509.689139109312
The pain of separation , however , might be alleviated on his side , by preparations for the reception of his bride , as he had reason to hope , that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire , the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men .	7148.2177280034275
No , I thank you ;	10344.387326127508
I have suspected it some time , but I am now convinced .	7807.346832652576
Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again , and weakened her disgust of Collins .	12148.051841105727
It was unpardonable .	9303.11926539923
No , said Colonel Fitzwilliam , that is an advantage which he must divide with me .	8644.118452470635
and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the probability of a rainy season , made her feel that the commonest , dullest , most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker .	7170.513216638204
Their visitors staid with them above half an hour , and when they arose to depart , Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing and Gardiner , and Miss Bennet , to dinner at Pemberley , before they left the country .	8004.38875291528
But upon my honour I do not .	11595.160715107038
She blushed , and Jane blushed ;	11459.069297607473
I promised them so faithfully !	11976.73710144939
which are naturally lively enough .	18688.030618268494
It was a subject , in short , on which reflection would be long indulged , and must be unavailing .	6834.7028035470275
The rooms were lofty and handsome , and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor ;	9362.122644749646
and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour Lady Lucas .	7834.732253468159
but Darcy , at whom it was all aimed , was still inflexibly studious .	9408.483608083154
What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosing's Park , when he put his letter into her hand !	8390.009507520506
Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas , for Collins was only a clergyman ;	10002.877232745523
The Collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave ;	9787.468384456444
Do you consider the forms of introduction , and the stress that is laid on them , as nonsense ?	8929.70859236937
As for Jane , her anxiety under this suspence was , of course , more painful than Elizabeth's ;	9053.70174761398
Indeed !	22116.04916256548
and I particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at Netherfield , '_She a beauty !	7586.7883985588105
I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well , I assure you .	7025.147495977557
and , perhaps , if I have very good luck , I may meet with another Collins in time .	7637.240416242151
From herself to Jane from Jane to Bingley , her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Darcy's explanation there , had appeared very insufficient ;	9029.140802588792
My father , however , is partial to Wickham .	10059.891217015254
The dejection was almost universal .	12933.295685910442
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper ;	8133.023524455591
But in spite of all this fine talking , my dear Lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured , that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair .	7237.059270569139
No why should he ?	16202.653246735536
As Gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she and her children should go to London , at the same time that Bennet came from it .	8433.799247572171
Yet , how just a humiliation !	15185.340590908721
Nay , when I read a letter of his , I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham , much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law .	8933.67438380345
Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ?	13094.230539093163
Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and which he thought the prettiest ?	9530.703730226072
In the afternoon , the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves ;	8371.416534220323
He has children of his own , and may have more .	8977.03492746763
Family pride , and filial pride , for he is very proud of what his father was , have done this .	10958.06644820173
It was to this effect : Since writing the above , dearest Lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ;	7251.736920295503
Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield , which was fixed for the following Tuesday .	8805.748525184415
This was his plan of amends of atonement for inheriting their father's estate ;	9481.971789467247
and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached .	7456.720629382526
If you will thank me , he replied , let it be for yourself alone .	8471.165257090164
I hope he will overlook it .	9188.970407090772
Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her .	11067.32197242277
that he should have been in love with her for so many months !	10359.557505749035
She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting .	9501.615909486134
and as she considered that Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations , and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct , she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before .	6977.684742226986
Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again ?	11091.171558873924
She was ashamed to think how much .	8654.764599652637
Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends ?	10039.43824255734
She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference .	8259.633267853953
1813 .	29757.454875608575
Do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart .	8470.583332737047
and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer !	7784.937982231335
Did you , on reading it , give any credit to its contents ?	10592.035196486122
When tea was over , Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table but in vain .	9985.174684099042
Yes , he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word .	8928.178414164051
and Elizabeth found , that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations' consent , there was still something to be wished for .	7516.861221339046
and neither the carriage , nor the livery of the servant who preceded it , were familiar to them .	8812.49640757398
Oh , well !	12132.34296790193
for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ;	9858.245595566965
Is nothing due to me on that score ?	13700.001429200323
but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter and said , Jane , I congratulate you .	7853.341352850503
Bennet's best comfort was , that Bingley must be down again in the summer .	10873.19500208206
and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , I never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them .	7332.126485957905
The park paling was still the boundary on one side , and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground .	8662.80332588279
Jane certainly could not come back .	14304.971630774473
To the civil enquiries which then poured in , and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Bingley's , she could not make a very favourable answer .	8330.841275371544
He begged pardon for having displeased her .	11272.821560837841
But she is nothing to me now .	8802.660535725126
Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time .	9771.285974464186
Miss Darcy , on her brother's entrance , exerted herself much more to talk ;	9256.273019862152
He made no answer , and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton .	7466.971098426095
the nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people !	12306.90977448305
If , indeed , it should be so !	11012.083180514355
I cannot fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation .	7688.752994184373
He had rather hoped that all his wife's views on the stranger would be disappointed ;	8524.4981034395
CHAPTER XVI .	13083.650239159624
Her report was highly favourable .	14312.623553225547
Every body said how well she looked ;	12802.95930855081
He seemed scarcely to hear her , and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation ;	8634.548665631273
They were now almost at the door of the house , for she had walked fast to get rid of him ;	7695.633004375469
He is so excessively handsome !	9983.429747334816
for Long has just been here , and she told me all about it .	10058.651991912238
where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure ;	11750.763712178736
Darcy , after enquiring of her how and Gardiner did , a question which she could not answer without confusion , said scarcely any thing .	8434.97168309958
They gradually ascended for half a mile , and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence , where the wood ceased , and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House , situated on the opposite side of a valley , into which the road with some abruptness wound .	7846.169221995172
He was too happy , however , to need much attention ;	8568.298307553507
Why Jane you never dropt a word of this ;	12946.678942812518
It was all pride and insolence .	7895.965406179158
How does Georgiana get on , Darcy ?	13043.337553028336
At such a distance as that , you know , things are strangely misrepresented .	9526.423873860023
and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted .	8960.23999301367
We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured .	9402.047900702451
pray make haste and come into the dining-room , for there is such a sight to be seen !	10946.837680107434
When they were gone , Elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent .	7644.802686853453
My dear Eliza he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way .	7798.731596499169
Her ease and good spirits increased .	13478.36292596751
Elizabeth , who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Darcy had been , was much relieved by discerning such different feelings .	7382.507250626073
Oh , yes !	6953.750776902737
, but its volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous locations .	14309.228866958429
Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship , in spite of a great opposition of character .	10875.056500704453
said Charlotte , as soon as he was gone .	11593.107703822401
There is also one other person in the party , he continued after a pause , who more particularly wishes to be known to you , Will you allow me , or do I ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton ?	7432.27231508681
When a woman has five grown up daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty .	9690.137025383432
cried his wife impatiently .	16985.802760801973
Neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude , replied Elizabeth , have any possible claim on me , in the present instance .	10125.314955483807
and addressed herself particularly to Bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation .	8038.1240524780005
His manners are very different from his cousin's .	12387.488809185816
But it is so strange !	8452.91538952604
About ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire , to which he belonged .	9386.095278189316
And pray what sort of guardians do you make ?	10902.725588635589
Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in my dressing-room .	11590.88759137568
Can you possibly guess , Lizzy , who is meant by this ?	11088.68585474783
You may depend upon my not mentioning it .	7321.630090977179
and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs .	8213.642533430564
and to prevent its ever happening again , took care to inform him at first , that it was a favourite haunt of hers .	7695.360483895805
certainly , cried his faithful assistant , no one can be really esteemed accomplished , who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with .	9883.239794406241
He was writing , and , without raising his head , coolly replied , Just as you please .	8064.683992121891
March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford .	17860.2559996941
Bennet was perfectly satisfied ;	12201.164449245949
When the gentlemen rose to go away , Bennet was mindful of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time .	8007.528375271388
that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking Darcy's character , though he had assured her that respect for the father , would always prevent his exposing the son .	8338.908465059965
His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost .	10708.252941851033
I have not the smallest hope .	5832.058597713885
She coloured as she spoke ;	12769.80187207903
She opened the door , and met Maria in the landing place , who , breathless with agitation , cried out , Oh , my dear Eliza !	8345.297853123328
There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed .	8287.534697665842
You shall hear what she says .	10001.0566924371
I do not see what right Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend's inclination , or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy .	6827.080364668851
A few weeks , he believed .	13169.708983995128
But think no more of the letter .	11595.416929195511
When is your next ball to be , Lizzy ?	12079.821528366927
You see how continually we are engaged there .	11016.949853008713
Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours ;	17860.2559996941
You know I always speak my mind , and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves .	8039.510198035342
See paragraph 1 .	24028.913751105658
I am happier even than Jane ;	7776.944530791701
but it must be done soon .	8177.374192153884
they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence ;	12503.394656714978
if it must be so , it must .	13435.775121453811
I should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match , cried Elizabeth .	7488.96855231613
She followed her father to the fire place , and they both sat down .	9388.219068589513
We have judged it best , that my niece should be married from this house , of which I hope you will approve .	8588.767822077501
and , after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable composure .	6921.388154438401
Yes , she will remain there till Christmas .	8529.449005558949
Special rules , set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license , apply to copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark .	9363.120962745803
and Gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing , by the servant's account , that their niece was taken suddenly ill ;	8262.19977548214
Remember , Eliza , that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do .	12406.195944854742
but I think I shall like your husband quite as well as Jane's .	7735.438676578473
I do not think we were speaking at all .	6244.32030556255
Well , cried her mother , it is all very right ;	8046.133317484847
and Hurst , principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings , joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss Bennet .	8279.53367062121
Yet he is such a man !	15185.704098326307
You have delighted us long enough .	9904.794194447026
Bennet could hardly contain herself .	13835.944861528067
Be that as it may , she saw him go with regret ;	12934.139602002082
She had even learnt to detect , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary .	7532.099979451598
dear me !	28053.312755478903
when it was no longer likely they should meet .	12992.311767570669
but with the rich , he is liberal-minded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and perhaps agreeable , allowing something for fortune and figure .	8182.416382834435
and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him .	8272.88289525472
You blamed me for coming ?	13297.930867437542
Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield ;	12273.338533411174
and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look .	7843.727001864707
Have you any idea , Lizzy , who this gentleman is ?	10513.937619547676
It was not in her nature , however , to increase her vexations , by dwelling on them .	6656.389840417154
and even Darcy acknowledged , that the partridges were remarkably well done ;	8832.623730478088
There is something very pompous in his style .	9500.889425069608
You certainly do , she replied with a smile ;	11190.295338582035
and though Collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as I have often told her , to come to Rosings every day , and play on the piano-forte in Jenkinson's room .	7443.987660283454
Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to conciliate her .	8828.107179142271
and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet .	6841.093722682104
They contained no actual complaint , nor was there any revival of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering .	9234.60563493051
Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage ;	9104.792546664567
Kitty was the only one who shed tears ;	13308.50680465051
And then you have added so much to it yourself , you are always buying books .	9067.201066634289
This cannot be !	12818.617838552687
and Elizabeth , who knew what curiosities his letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise .	7421.627819776194
When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer , I made a point of her having two men servants go with her .	9039.520491708989
Elizabeth , on her side , had much to do .	8631.027529451494
The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a headache ;	9964.522590014027
Indeed , Jane , you ought to believe me .	11401.152686822938
And so would Anne , if her health had allowed her to apply .	9165.743362174111
I will read it to you When my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to London , might be concluded in three or four days , but as we are certain it cannot be so , and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town , he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel .	6923.2046363336
They entered it in one of its lowest points , and drove for some time through a beautiful wood , stretching over a wide extent .	8707.259666128894
May we take my uncle's letter to read to her ?	13975.233930193963
When the card tables were placed , he had an opportunity of obliging her in return , by sitting down to whist .	8375.8269219305
After a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display .	7710.454142468517
but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands .	7467.26899867752
he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and that , if he marry prudently , his wife may teach him .	9573.572700051813
and Bennet , for many years after Lydia's birth , had been certain that he would .	8046.668738300028
and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements , new carriages and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield , in the course of three or four months .	7758.845621744431
hatred had vanished long ago , and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him , that could be so called .	10090.83491212674
But I will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well .	7051.117095342532
If his own vanity , however , did not mislead him , he was the cause , his pride and caprice were the cause of all that Jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer .	8246.75055553441
I fancy , Lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all .	8848.335709340427
Their affectionate mother shared all their grief ;	13826.01871253263
a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room .	7988.044552978245
Pray , how violent was Bingley's love ?	13650.119748376415
but Lady Catherine very resolutely , and not very politely , declined eating any thing ;	9585.693482509332
Now what have you to say ?	16088.115373454326
and in front , a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater , but without any artificial appearance .	7783.414297354868
He carved , and ate , and praised with delighted alacrity ;	10483.103594789805
E5 .	40048.92076156133
But though every thing seemed neat and comfortable , she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance ;	8674.865161085469
When I am in the country , he replied , I never wish to leave it ;	8774.502254656232
It only shews her being deficient in something herself sense or feeling .	10215.881324046737
Yes , very well .	9914.995518468082
and , though she was not very sanguine in expecting it , the application was a something to look forward to .	7022.993658747665
Is this a hint to me , Lizzy , said her father , to send for the horses ?	8544.285278194835
and more than commonly anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her .	8337.225408344733
However , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts , and I am very glad to hear what you tell us , of long sleeves .	8578.731406391316
you know he is , as well as I do ;	11801.44523629619
Pray forgive me , if I have been very presuming , or at least do not punish me so far , as to exclude me from P I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park .	8459.835034201311
Your idea of the ponies is delightful .	13591.768443358396
then recollecting himself , I will not detain you a minute , but let me , or let the servant , go after and Gardiner .	9975.383803819674
In the first place , he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron .	7427.456814505559
but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you .	8439.60755105097
Bennet could not have chosen better .	13066.298907227674
and know them to be so much attached to me !	10061.882196409013
Her sister made not the smallest objection , and the piano-forte was opened , and Darcy , after a few moments recollection , was not sorry for it .	8268.958663935047
Elizabeth was surprised , but said not a word .	6971.454815627849
CHAPTER X More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park , unexpectedly meet Darcy .	9708.975528219195
They have none of them much to recommend them , replied he ;	9475.512629994028
After walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on resuming their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant , there chanced to be a little alteration .	8027.228020856935
and Collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much .	9846.246103470274
and yet it should seem by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy .	7744.648284259364
I dare say you believed it ;	8016.490157311661
You are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on ;	8353.483573641535
nothing , therefore , could be fairly conjectured from that , though Elizabeth , who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings , was perfectly aware , that , had she known nothing of Darcy , she could have borne the dread of Lydia's infamy somewhat better .	8526.606047913276
her voice was weak , and her manner affected .	13836.399366027097
Would you believe it , Lizzy , that when he went to town last November , he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent , would have prevented his coming down again !	8969.820468133237
he kissed it with affectionate gallantry , though he hardly knew how to look , and they entered the house .	9811.160442435174
The particulars , I reserve till we meet .	11325.87245239925
and she looked on the whole scene , the river , the trees scattered on its banks , and the winding of the valley , as far as she could trace it , with delight .	7192.51766735243
It was an animating subject , and Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match .	7311.07347399439
Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ;	9588.212586051472
Neither could any thing be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities which Darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach .	8977.203388775497
She then sought her eldest sister , who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley .	8260.832239617195
From Collins !	22430.143482373023
Will you do me the honour of reading that letter ?	12102.814236315155
So , Lizzy , said he one day , your sister is crossed in love I find .	10328.174268699007
Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately ;	8452.30161620976
There was no want of discourse .	9639.160761112851
His coming into the country at all , is a most insolent thing indeed , and I wonder how he could presume to do it .	8445.589134745502
So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him !	12662.699500112485
and he was obliged to walk about the room , while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences .	7421.291918112228
How well it sounds .	15746.540267266397
It should not be said , that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers .	8638.011796815212
and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself ;	6884.75483464633
They found Bennet still up .	13076.984294774777
and they conversed with so much spirit and flow , as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself , as well as of Darcy .	7670.787792266876
But it is , returned she ;	8317.327707963932
He shook his head .	13026.334215110712
His daughter's request , for such it might be considered , of being admitted into her family again , before she set off for the North , received at first an absolute negative .	8561.839558664753
Stop me whilst you can .	21197.236933954446
Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure , and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming , when she found herself so affectionately received .	8925.300393139454
Is it possible !	17662.284881833733
Let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ;	8988.734727989991
He delighted in going to Pemberley , especially when he was least expected .	10041.04086419976
I had no notion but he would go a shooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company .	7874.390465515594
Elizabeth was in agonies .	9981.417736996413
Your uncle is as much surprised as I am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned , would have allowed him to act as he has done .	8643.416418493522
This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted : and Elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away .	8194.890114307687
Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to his wife ?	12168.810303038314
On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects .	9537.733168894552
An express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from Colonel Forster , to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers ;	8724.100443617033
This has been my motive , my fair cousin , and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem .	9124.31468932887
You ought certainly to forgive them as a christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing .	8364.981030047415
I will not encourage the impudence of either , by receiving them at Longbourn .	7435.8700521484525
The next morning , however , made an alteration ;	8574.558235561743
Charlotte is an excellent manager , I dare say .	12171.106955804436
It is evident by this , added Jane , that he comes back no more this winter .	7604.335406211273
To be sure that did seem as if he admired her indeed I rather believe he did I heard something about it but I hardly know what something about Robinson .	7843.1707841452735
With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ;	10379.547804330094
When she remembered the style of his address , she was still full of indignation ;	9407.181863733105
When first Bennet had married , economy was held to be perfectly useless ;	10371.357169667564
The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came , and Bennet was forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle , was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth .	7814.189775812609
can it be really so !	21197.236933954446
She had never seen a place for which nature had done more , or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste .	7370.76875908492
I hope , added Gardiner , that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her .	7640.521150506412
what can have induced him to behave so cruelly ?	13511.532049505526
Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications .	9607.81399312193
His eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity ;	10222.869023085947
As soon as all had ate , and the elder ones paid , the carriage was ordered ;	8463.945186461835
You know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself .	8548.667408685806
Let me hear what it is .	11430.25119927075
He meant , I believe , replied Jane , to go to Epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the postilions , and try if any thing could be made out from them .	7978.7085484652835
observed Bennet .	32181.680394962303
and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible .	7210.615487747943
The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic .	10165.00846862854
My overhearings were more to the purpose than yours , Eliza , said Charlotte .	10240.37016456531
his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had .	8940.180212799953
said Elizabeth .	14806.870074320834
The first mentioned was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , I had detached Bingley from your sister , and the other , that I had , in defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , ruined the immediate prosperity , and blasted the prospects of Wickham .	7483.06523859544
Darcy is all politeness , said Elizabeth , smiling .	10927.546547814873
said Jane .	15225.41796251982
It was some days , however , before they received any invitation thither , for while there were visitors in the house , they could not be necessary ;	7278.511702083275
Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth and it was soon done done while Bennet was stirring the fire .	9345.195590240777
I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings , and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three , of whom we shall deprive you .	7863.684803043365
It taught me to hope , said he , as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before .	8782.418223251383
but since then , we have both , I hope , improved in civility .	9220.060643936593
but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him .	8390.025868975803
When Jane and Elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in her praise of Bingley before , expressed to her sister how very much she admired him .	8705.059790511288
There can be no love in all this .	9391.157565955255
Yet it is hard , she sometimes thought , that this poor man cannot come to a house , which he has legally hired , without raising all this speculation !	9028.817160025426
and Bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice .	8942.802118040629
Good heavens !	24136.753235300534
If I had been able , said she , to carry my point of going to Brighton , with all my family , this would not have happened ;	7848.2516810055995
Indeed I had .	16688.2532126946
and in the mean time , she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married , to Hill and the two housemaids .	7207.469940631543
Lydia's being settled in the North , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment ;	8773.566658601148
The younger ones out before the elder are married !	10469.308129063902
My excellent father died about five years ago ;	12081.93116426062
We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening , said Elizabeth .	8541.390237852193
And if you will stay another month complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London , for I am going there early in June , for a week ;	7809.317729269309
Lizzy , you must not do so .	11201.177082983515
Only look at her .	18482.17465216195
and the Hursts have no horses to theirs .	8301.108578237465
She directly replied , You need not be frightened .	10862.52498498691
How nicely we are crammed in !	13743.89915558887
The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning's impatience .	9964.522590014027

Lizzy , when you first read that letter , I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now .	8772.935666498879
but her's she thought was still worse .	11670.622208466782
and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty .	9394.438872343102
But does Lydia know nothing of this ?	10993.232603879045
She counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent ;	9891.400445606268
Can such abominable pride as his , have ever done him good ?	11976.156504290395
Oh !	6826.5207498362
Good Heaven !	15987.831621001465
Have all her friends left her ?	16088.115373454326
Their brother , indeed , was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency .	9674.725069332408
The colour which had been driven from her face , returned for half a minute with an additional glow , and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes , as she thought for that space of time , that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken .	7781.446217934895
Pardon me .	24454.545160417056
My dear , dear Lizzy , I would I do congratulate you but are you certain ?	7305.095467170708
Her father had been an attorney in Meryton , and had left her four thousand pounds .	8916.524742439622
She had fully proposed being engaged by Wickham for those very dances : and to have Collins instead !	7958.80407498165
I am so grieved for him .	7096.746497298122
She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together .	7576.1469728670845
no , I certainly am not .	14825.623953766859
You quite mistook Darcy .	14186.951238002608
but this is the true one .	10655.257851899287
Yes , in conjunction with his friend .	9342.472320478171
and still different from either , was what Bennet sent to Collins , in reply to his last .	8646.274886440973
Bingley was every thing that was charming , except the professed lover of her daughter .	9428.10309557729
They repulsed every attempt of Bennet at conversation , and by so doing , threw a languor over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Collins , who was complimenting Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests .	7801.442388171788
As all conversation was thereby at an end , Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room .	10377.73620274997
Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject ;	11657.58048866103
When first he came in , he had spoken to her but little ;	9999.8892408915
If it is designedly done , they cannot be justified ;	10138.63853096126
But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both .	7605.651581146106
and , as they drew near the appointed inn where Bennet's carriage was to meet them , they quickly perceived , in token of the coachman's punctuality , both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs .	7107.099086735889
What , none of you ?	12833.26515009689
Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman , and required information ;	10442.467592381901
Well , my comfort is , I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done .	7294.850582715036
Too much , I am afraid ;	19319.888049311197
This was very amiable , but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any conception of ;	9090.828832939776
His family knew him to be on all common occasions , a most negligent and dilatory correspondent , but at such a time , they had hoped for exertion .	8594.883464885668
His first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance , as far as it would go .	8084.126215071296
She wanted to talk , but there seemed an embargo on every subject .	8811.454951030059
In every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived .	10315.91482086651
but on perceiving Darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner .	8481.401284018624
She was more alive to the disgrace , which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham , a fortnight before they took place .	7393.978646461606
and Gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in London the very next day , and would assist Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia .	7727.005218396758
And then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you ;	8617.302262424897
As for Elizabeth , her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last ;	9094.61592877952
They are not married , nor can I find there was any intention of being so ;	8795.923932536898
for you are really proud of your defects in writing , because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution , which if not estimable , you think at least highly interesting .	8100.865315507016
You never will be able to make both of them good for any thing .	9599.959572521248
They walked towards the Lucases , because Kitty wished to call upon Maria ;	10028.46618609298
But you see that Jane , said her aunt , does not think so ill of Wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt .	7309.574375258394
I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ;	8860.51779910711
it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it .	9231.279646865283
The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend , assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London , might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment .	8047.9572101009735
She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either , or make either appear to advantage .	8601.558849869141
You allude perhaps to the entail of this estate .	11190.18819084506
She could not win him , however , to any conversation ;	7873.270094957208
by her ease and liveliness , his mind might have been softened , his manners improved , and from his judgment , information , and knowledge of the world , she must have received benefit of greater importance .	9196.63248461504
Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone .	10013.027011423519
I enquired after their brother , of course .	10147.385309103438
Bennet could hardly comprehend it .	13835.944861528067
and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both .	8259.606955968902
Dear me !	27062.917040164626
by reason , by reflection , by every thing .	15751.933081637262
to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed , and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation , console herself for the present , and prepare for another disappointment .	8747.19959348356
During dinner , Bennet scarcely spoke at all ;	15891.494099313808
To convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself , was no very difficult point .	10024.11572275852
my daughters are brought up differently .	15603.338573119987
and after listening a moment , she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry , and calling loudly after her .	7887.891867926027
Why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent , said she , did he come at all ?	8974.810480421136
I do think it is the hardest thing in the world , that your estate should be entailed away from your own children ;	7207.496569753542
Bennet treasured up the hint , and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married ;	10128.78697437095
Do you know Bingley ?	12971.559378185098
Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy .	10942.105258906742
and very unwillingly said so .	11169.170062107289
Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter ;	9783.268029690822
Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not .	8586.277546442976
He had been some time with Gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river , and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning .	7356.527638261021
He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies , of whose beauty he had heard much ;	8103.8576073275035
Good God !	24136.753235300534
Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever .	8542.121803336824
Something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them , but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life .	9386.095322423496
it came from Netherfield , and was opened immediately .	9906.262447483787
They have each their advantages , and I can be equally happy in either .	9511.83320750412
She was wild to be at home to hear , to see , to be upon the spot , to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her , in a family so deranged ;	7413.787866836201
In making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self-reproach .	8434.149978808902
CHAPTER I Elizabeth , as they drove along , watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation ;	9343.502848913398
Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance ;	9245.78787831093
And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton , of whom I shall subjoin a list , according to his information .	8272.235617864557
But make a virtue of it by all means .	10343.636042502436
Arguments are too much like disputes .	19318.963320888248
I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , Lizzy ?	9332.565628551094
The rest of the evening passed with the appearance , on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no farther attempt to distinguish Elizabeth ;	7375.148156651204
I believe , Ma'am , I may safely promise you never to dance with him .	8493.992340275505
No , no .	10672.950423193104
and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least .	7882.180842338286
At length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself .	7006.883038205055
She followed him with her eyes , envied every one to whom he spoke , had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee ;	8303.628210755945
I never saw such a long chin in my life .	6874.10797281393
I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield .	5692.125473338934
cried Elizabeth ;	15563.674567018004
but this was all lost upon me .	9776.759239601708
No , Kitty , I have at last learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it .	8520.498923221736
The principal purport of his letter was to inform them , that Wickham had resolved on quitting the Militia .	9142.986776614829
I shall be very fit to see Jane which is all I want .	7646.273781716765
When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford , every eye was in search of the Parsonage , and every turning expected to bring it in view .	8333.93688722133
her complexion has no brilliancy ;	17761.767089364243
said her mother as soon as she was in the hall .	10061.949822671468
They will join me early to-morrow , he continued , and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you , Bingley and his sisters .	8308.964214198288
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity .	10064.608984476474
I do not mind his not talking to Long , said Miss Lucas , but I wish he had danced with Eliza .	6567.799854658293
but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder .	9145.472690901932
Yes , there can ;	10626.323894731187
If you received the work electronically , the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund .	7079.847054583208
Make haste , make haste .	17546.76970557886
My reasons for believing it are briefly these : It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance , or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable .	8330.679314723873
After amusing himself some time with their curiosity , he thus explained .	11342.835575931713
I had not believed it possible .	8075.214670558621
Forgive me ;	27062.431384575917
This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself .	8935.699055307154
Darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say something indistinctly of his concern , and observe her in compassionate silence .	8678.148947433416
At length there was nothing more to be said ;	10705.405125913416
Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ;	11653.267143696412
She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room .	9537.26717823612
But at least it shews , that she was serious in the object of her journey .	8953.3142715068
but , exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone .	8057.434475199551
Elizabeth quietly answered Undoubtedly ;	14194.97897315015
Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic ;	13591.768443358396
You must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course .	7129.269143394652
I can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ;	8218.43198508952
Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming .	12264.532127390808
I dare say she will ;	8648.175628133058
But self , though it would intrude , could not engross her .	10063.22351132749
His temptation is not adequate to the risk .	12387.488809185816
a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point , without being resented .	11235.857423077287
Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal from the shire , as clearly as Gardiner could do .	8902.748472064799
To Bennet's acknowledgments he briefly replied , with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family ;	9496.777643593336
When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned , in terms of such mortifying , yet merited reproach , her sense of shame was severe .	8222.085585271445
He is now gone into the army , she added , but I am afraid he has turned out very wild .	7355.331662489053
and , after giving each of them an hasty kiss , hurried into the vestibule , where Jane , who came running down stairs from her mother's apartment , immediately met her .	7134.15585806627
Take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one .	12934.036397629263
I am most seriously displeased .	7375.963545517659
When they ascended the steps to the hall , Maria's alarm was every moment increasing , and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm .	8579.255314927974
My feelings will not be repressed .	12086.123771636343
Nor was Darcy's vindication , though grateful to her feelings , capable of consoling her for such discovery .	10216.149365893547
All that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds , secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ;	8302.899983831187
My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other .	10529.282618686302
She has known him only a fortnight .	9913.305280484425
I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being .	7617.703468446862
and Elizabeth , as they waited for the housekeeper , had leisure to wonder at her being where she was .	7114.565035690165
Elizabeth , though expecting no less , thanked him with tears of gratitude ;	8343.017271109202
I am sick of them all .	6928.635767578781
You shall not , for the sake of one individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that selfishness is prudence , and insensibility of danger , security for happiness .	7501.313113886077
Elizabeth now began to revive .	12492.424153928798
She received him with her very best politeness , which he returned with as much more , apologising for his intrusion , without any previous acquaintance with her , which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice .	7795.717100565716
Very nonsensical to come at all !	15707.57653967831
Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to identify , do copyright research on , transcribe and proofread public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm collection .	9468.815646217447
From that moment I observed my friend's behaviour attentively ;	12993.305101288988
One enjoyment was certain that of suitableness as companions ;	13277.638173395631
And if I am that choice , why may not I accept him ?	9363.0911635044
D The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you can do with this work .	11151.047019778664
Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival , that Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine ;	7292.862808209713
Elizabeth smiled .	15554.784002470953
Such doings discomposed Bennet exceedingly .	16678.594513170974
My sister , who is more than ten years my junior , was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew , Colonel Fitzwilliam , and myself .	8613.625323086264
It suddenly struck her that it might be from lady Catherine ;	10448.944365679588
E8 .	26953.136861511783
Let Wickham be your man .	16076.472316590718
She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it .	8212.67294943283
At last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance of Darcy , with such a smile over the face , as she remembered to have sometimes seen , when he looked at her .	8475.118350512783
and whenever they changed their quarters , either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to , for some little assistance towards discharging their bills .	8087.2428133217045
But I must write no more .	8401.468550764488
and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation .	9217.158072632896
Write to me very often , my dear .	15438.00718452369
She could see him instantly before her , in every charm of air and address ;	8437.091645090548
But , really , I know not what to say .	8619.132645058495
and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it , to Ramsgate ;	9217.158072632896
His plan did not vary on seeing them .	12387.488809185816
Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ?	11117.001634928773
just enough to make one good sort of man ;	15040.745064379998
and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been ;	8639.444174743128
Poor Jane !	24456.299746338827
The more I see of the world , the more am I dissatisfied with it ;	9317.70249569024
He and his sisters were well , I hope , when you left London .	9859.209346270854
International donations are gratefully accepted , but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States .	9885.92811360066
CHAPTER III .	15231.67119605404
Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect , that the sight of such rooms , so many servants , and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them .	8237.980186648401
Don't keep coughing so , Kitty , for heaven's sake !	14333.913868201405
Under such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief .	10874.994121645499
and at that moment she felt , that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something !	8330.420737087496
Lord , how ashamed I should be of not being married before three and twenty !	11298.667106521134
She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure .	8827.345373710863
nor could she for many hours , learn to think of it less than incessantly .	9712.46779200254
You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness ;	9621.860251484708
His consenting to marry her is a proof , I will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking .	8853.24130467911
To-morrow fortnight .	32181.680394962303
but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other , of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that Denny had brought him from London , and that he was to have a lieutenant's commission in the shire .	7229.502223958027
It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way .	7634.801340545125
My youngest of all , is lately married , and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds , walking with a young man , who I believe will soon become a part of the family .	7880.314458273033
They were then , with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance , taken into the house ;	8174.379515891585
But Elizabeth , who had not the least inclination to remain with them , laughingly answered , No , no ;	8518.415850294998
and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement .	7474.34533856448
All field sports were over .	16574.528429879447
My style of writing is very different from yours .	11645.984323451477
c .	29757.454875608575
and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror , Gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power .	8053.76160175799
Thus , we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition .	12069.542192349307
She wrote even to Jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her former professions of regard .	8495.782420089427
CHAPTER X The day passed much as the day before had done .	10648.672205884148
He merely added , that he should not write again , till he had something of importance to mention .	8231.294734138022
It originated in Gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support , and consequently preferred her husband's .	8357.157093392056
After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with It is your turn to say something now , Darcy .	8814.268589685953
and his commendation of every thing would have touched Bennet's heart , but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property .	7787.209982285083
She comes to us to-day .	12769.80187207903
I will not tell you what it is .	7648.706209162914
At length however Bennet had no more to say ;	10222.161955606418
The power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor , and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance .	8206.386231624954
Then turning to Bennet , he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon .	11639.0714462922
The subjection in which his father had brought him up , had given him originally great humility of manner , but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head , living in retirement , and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity .	7880.195529281392
From the entrance hall , of which Collins pointed out , with a rapturous air , the fine proportion and finished ornaments , they followed the servants through an anti-chamber , to the room where Lady Catherine , her daughter , and Jenkinson were sitting .	8104.7371925466205
and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over .	7014.116994203834
Now , said she , that this first meeting is over , I feel perfectly easy .	10136.255185380773
The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited .	10394.12160441077
After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight , and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear ;	8965.524760820286
What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy ?	12428.340057783096
Lydia was exceedingly fond of him .	13561.694333765594
When coffee was over , Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him ;	10137.0404000595
I do not believe she often sees such at home .	6020.379230535765
A clergyman like you must marry .	13169.708983995128
But gracious me !	14545.88730809158
It was agreed to .	9037.308997878628
But she would not be secure .	8976.328813874974
Though I shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ;	11472.795994734666
You are so strange !	10207.38715375172
Having resolved to do it without loss of time , as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday , and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment , he set about it in a very orderly manner , with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business .	8119.264198230776
E GARDINER .	28053.312755478903
For my own part , she rejoined , I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her .	9441.143335627952
and in the evening Bennet's invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter .	7074.164732166821
Yes , always , she replied , without knowing what she said , for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , I remember hearing you once say , Darcy , that you hardly ever forgave , that your resentment once created was unappeasable .	7470.496511710344
my sweetest Lizzy !	20419.512527493152
And I think you will agree with me , in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece's .	8302.843217838543
Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations ;	12413.660306760046
CHAPTER XVIII .	13083.650239159624
F6 .	40048.92076156133
that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her , and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening .	8808.179296762184
CHAPTER III .	15231.67119605404
What a charming amusement for young people this is , Darcy !	9860.446788278172
I remember , as soon as ever I saw him , when he first came into Hertfordshire last year , I thought how likely it was that you should come together .	8029.275090246415
But it is all , all too late now .	8026.641282700521
and Bennet found , with amazement and horror , that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter .	8070.228649625742
She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse , but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other , and how formal and cold was their manner , whenever they did .	6934.761153060286
No one who has ever seen you together , can doubt his affection .	10095.70288756829
Elizabeth listened as little as she could , but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name .	8758.442477090755
that it should be equally unreserved was impossible .	12746.04015365494
It is because he will not give himself the trouble .	8253.237002753232
Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself , and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam , Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word I say .	8216.515486730124
He is perfectly well behaved , polite , and unassuming , said her uncle .	8199.529218079824
You have reduced him to his present state of poverty , comparative poverty .	8698.331986223984
Nearly three weeks .	25135.81112403321
Oh !	6826.5207498362
His appearance was greatly in his favour ;	12948.910166249201
I have sent for you on an affair of importance .	7919.848200288962
When to these recollections was added the developement of Wickham's character , it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before , were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful .	8187.080446081697
but Ashworth is too far off !	12184.022060036506
She now lost every expectation of pleasure .	11631.972540886642
Miss Bennet , replied her ladyship , in an angry tone , you ought to know , that I am not to be trifled with .	7627.92226412824
for I consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman .	8943.371294239088
On reaching the spacious lobby above , they were shewn into a very pretty sitting-room , lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below ;	8647.07813915877
You know pretty well , I suppose , what has been done for the young people .	8629.607028685425
At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted .	11652.22961393325
I never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong .	8131.732774001103
Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible .	14968.396085319508
Elizabeth silently attended her .	14194.97897315015
Oh , Jane , take care .	9407.641168775284
Oh !	6826.5207498362
' But afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time .	10324.230707834451
She examined into their employments , looked at their work , and advised them to do it differently ;	9193.523697181645
CHAPTER XI .	13083.650239159624
unless you looked up to him as a superior .	15040.745064379998
I have therefore made up my mind to tell you , that I do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare .	7239.927668696319
and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William , in which she was readily joined by Jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of Collins , and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London .	7411.7629157243855
Who do you mean , my dear ?	14962.954559138454
Though Bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage .	9110.984799223412
how can it affect them ?	15765.907607321122
They had nothing to accuse him of but pride ;	9867.005220192672
He was coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland : when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey .	7529.898658938215
Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game , except when Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh's being too hot or too cold , or having too much or too little light .	9052.771785676194
but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future .	7764.869321610028

He scarcely ever spoke to her , and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself , were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas , whose civility in listening to him , was a seasonable relief to them all , and especially to her friend .	7664.438249788881
CHAPTER VIII .	13083.650239159624
When at length they arose to take leave , Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn ;	9089.567094449478
I could see him with perfect indifference , but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of .	8232.728155609042
I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes .	9229.908139688154
and the two , who were most anxiously expected , to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen , were in very good time .	7557.713074127861
No one but Bennet , regretted that their stay would be so short ;	9734.107989250473
Lydia has no brothers to step forward ;	14580.966327816357
CHAPTER XII .	13083.650239159624
Well , mamma , said she , when they were all returned to the breakfast room , and what do you think of my husband ?	7836.627614934205
'Tis as good as a Lord !	17629.261046688665
forgive the question are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ?	12843.515031683957
and therefore gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent , his actions were capable of a very different construction ;	7658.926979604261
But what is that to me ?	10174.239569924077
a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade .	10102.06333514203
To fortune I am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since I am well aware that it could not be complied with ;	8732.44359366161
Girls , can I do any thing for you in Meryton ?	14309.228866958429
[ Illustration : Morning Dress .	15710.4742996016
But the wife of Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation , that she could , upon the whole , have no cause to repine .	7643.648170788012
Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table , and they went up stairs together .	9275.974009300851
Your alliance will be a disgrace ;	14371.026693246546
I have every reason in the world to think ill of you .	7807.471400416465
Elizabeth immediately recognising the livery , guessed what it meant , and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations , by acquainting them with the honour which she expected .	8283.646915496352
At present , indeed , they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood ;	8334.617045504338
The world has been deceived in that respect ;	10778.888497054491
Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility ;	10688.989916687806
He must write his own sermons ;	11076.402896026319
which will not be yours till after your mother's decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to .	10572.115325269155
She stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation , and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery .	8913.854841992224
Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ?	9285.668784796475
Miss Darcy's praise occupied the chief of it .	12689.239757425776
Recovering himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said , Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of .	9779.935124235826
Is her husband , is the son of his late father's steward , to be his brother ?	10512.059350804137
Lady Catherine approached , and , after listening for a few minutes , said to Darcy , Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss , if she practised more , and could have the advantage of a London master .	7711.863424467966
but Sir William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane , who were dancing together .	8010.382901520363
How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell , but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you .	9058.850508325348
Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother .	13108.427099975128
Certainly , replied Elizabeth there are such people , but I hope I am not one of them .	9368.586630759468
See paragraph 1 .	24028.913751105658
I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did .	7848.822796733322
Had his own happiness , however , been the only sacrifice , he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best ;	8728.19280587434
And with a bow to Darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room .	8169.920803309376
She would not betray her trust , I suppose , without bribery and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be found .	7783.225029120544
but they were now necessary , and she assured him with some confusion , of her attachment to Darcy .	8858.59822258952
All was acknowledged , and half the night spent in conversation .	11716.063972792082
If we are ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been , said Elizabeth , and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what Gardiner has done for them , because Wickham has not sixpence of his own .	7798.984247154292
Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father .	14968.26171970973
Hunsford , near Westerham , Kent , 15th October .	15751.933081637262
Bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from London , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time .	8020.304927723207
and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life .	7565.472806233081
I would keep a pack of foxhounds , and drink a bottle of wine every day .	8224.456827315356
Now , seriously , what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence ?	11152.761740432516
and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to elope with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ;	7181.652578403197
Must it be so ?	23693.74868846463
These bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had I with greater policy concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified , unalloyed inclination ;	9044.959259534453
I hope she will turn out well .	8994.77487809852
Teaze him laugh at him .	19903.00084891939
She danced four dances with him at Meryton ;	10671.681879081778
While the contents of the first letter remained on her mind , she was all surprise all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl , whom it was impossible he could marry for money ;	8734.247554905081
Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start , and before he could recover himself enough to speak , she , in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's situation , hastily exclaimed , I beg your pardon , but I must leave you .	7834.094040176699
I know not , Miss Elizabeth , said he , whether Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us , but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it .	7301.380559454008
And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection .	8799.079525818192
Any place would do , of about three or four hundred a year ;	12331.154521141309
The note was immediately dispatched , and its contents as quickly complied with .	9964.522590014027
and when it closed , Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon Charlotte's degree of contentment , to understand her address in guiding , and composure in bearing with her husband , and to acknowledge that it was all done very well .	7354.416004530695
But no letter appeared , and she was completely puzzled .	9839.387787292228
This was a lucky idea of mine , indeed !	8963.683817185047
but it is not sound .	8660.326857466262
What is his name ?	13100.890758495381
Reynolds , either from pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister .	10481.826862881548
Her look and manners were open , cheerful and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and I remained convinced from the evening's scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment .	8041.472872166433
Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer , and forced his younger sister to be civil also , and say what the occasion required .	8608.255574318404
Every thing that is charming !	14015.571857089308
and after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do , which was the more probable from the time of year .	7454.660878594981
Brother-in-law of Wickham !	27147.744358519656
Happy shall I be , when his stay at Netherfield is over !	13228.58711448504
Miss Darcy was tall , and on a larger scale than Elizabeth ;	10155.016748133816
At present we have nothing to guide us .	11449.313128607933
The account of his connection with the Pemberley family , was exactly what he had related himself ;	8660.852564573663
Your sisters are engaged , and there is not another woman in the room , whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with .	8991.550631088267
When I wrote that letter , replied Darcy , I believed myself perfectly calm and cool , but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit .	8255.507036846651
The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth , as the first .	9362.122644749646
We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Wickham with money .	9892.93657160269
As soon as they had driven from the door , Elizabeth was called on by her cousin , to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings , which , for Charlotte's sake , she made more favourable than it really was .	7241.7583997481825
They may wish many things besides his happiness ;	11098.60364434535
I must conclude , for I cannot be long from my poor mother .	8295.770642368532
cried Elizabeth , brightening up for a moment .	9701.049015507579
But however he did not .	11945.286776886705
Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Hurst or Miss Bingley ;	10342.447283914342
Your friend performs delightfully ;	16612.63608213801
and the valley , here contracted into a glen , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it .	7485.032615634094
They could talk of nothing but officers ;	11252.318853050005
Their conduct has been such , replied Elizabeth , as neither you , nor I , nor any body , can ever forget .	9469.365826278505
She had obtained private intelligence that Darcy did not wish for cards ;	8321.834576534273
why is not every body as happy ?	16933.094192791534
nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable .	12054.310243313854
He had never before supposed that , could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter , it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself , as by the present arrangement .	7361.246451760263
Kitty stared at him , and Lydia exclaimed .	13983.858413838241
Elizabeth could not help saying , It is very much to his credit , I am sure , that you should think so .	6598.3801080881785
On their being joined by Bingley himself , Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas ;	11037.33681403787
Wickham passed all his youth there , you know .	11725.843698462699
As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , I shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females .	8228.849871313188
Very little was said by either ;	15707.57653967831
repeated Elizabeth , in utter amazement .	17211.857578566356
her liveliness had been never worse timed .	15378.32081519848
Perhaps it will be as well , if you discourage his coming here so very often .	9978.714296667304
CHAPTER V Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate .	9415.005140346417
She retreated from the window , fearful of being seen ;	10564.671323236123
he sustained it however with fortitude , and so far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into conversation with Gardiner .	8877.180805309072
She shared in their attendance on Bennet , and was a great comfort to them , in their hours of freedom .	8913.902259392653
Does he know his real character ?	16894.957560084396
In her kind schemes for Elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam .	9964.588450295856
We shall often meet , I hope , in Hertfordshire .	10447.270487583888
replied Kitty , it looks just like that man that used to be with him before .	11771.350470960326
If you were to give me forty such men , I never could be so happy as you .	8127.168982684788
She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious , made no other reply to Elizabeth's salutation , than a slight inclination of the head , and sat down without saying a word .	7657.062581900326
He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever , on the occasion .	8607.204825491557
What is to become of us !	11129.20786452197
It was kindly meant .	9037.308997878628
Lydia declared herself satisfied .	18201.28263043267
My sister , I am sure , will not hear of her removal .	9213.972551577226
The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities , though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings ;	8334.957974271287
If it was not for the entail I should not mind it .	8802.943988117095
And then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it .	8473.397429550283
They have some of the finest woods in the country .	9106.500865704791
Oh !	6826.5207498362
What did you say of me , that I did not deserve ?	10513.98804581453
You forget that I have made no answer .	9979.02848240418
Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility .	10292.990700580074
Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied , Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully .	8541.004035824131
I know not what to think .	7501.490575293103
Bennet could not give her consent , or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , though she talked to Bingley of nothing else , for half an hour ;	8450.305377223569
She knew not what to think , nor how to account for it .	8679.17543938081
So much the better .	10560.519660768812
You wanted me , I know , to say 'Yes , ' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste ;	8977.408646243943
It is admirable !	9420.946731167745
They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which I cannot wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects .	7916.056025577589
pride he probably had , and if not , it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town , where the family did not visit .	9981.024565232072
But , Lizzy , you can tell us whether it is like or not .	7045.67628369717
and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's dying an old maid .	7874.363731799275
The wisest and the best of men , nay , the wisest and best of their actions , may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke .	8290.875906141224
Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper ;	10086.713790378963
and it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning , and never said a word about it till now .	7508.711350936765
After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room , from the sideboard to the fender , to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London , Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden , which was large and well laid out , and to the cultivation of which he attended himself .	7702.642438837975
I should infinitely prefer a book .	9041.707993389418
but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless Darcy returned within the stated time .	8080.171714534162
This is not to be borne .	10155.938619576895
Had his first appearance , or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining , been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Darcy , the gardener's expression of surprise , on beholding his master , must immediately have told it .	8179.365538290856
Hurst had therefore nothing to do , but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep .	10247.860269718993
I thought it would never be over ;	8902.463993149147
But if I do not take your likeness now , I may never have another opportunity .	8178.25105625951
Elizabeth made no answer , and walked on , her heart swelling with indignation .	6989.096014131035
And do you like her ?	10411.103323589856
It was an evening of no common delight to them all ;	7481.346982084816
I never can be thankful , Bennet , for any thing about the entail .	8195.124435688484
Were the same fair prospect to arise at present , as had flattered them a year ago , every thing , she was persuaded , would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion .	8826.188982612264
He danced only four dances !	13105.31966129148
I have not a doubt of Bingley's sincerity , said Elizabeth warmly ;	6088.562298903765
Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother , on his approaching marriage , were all that was affectionate and insincere .	9218.324471382355
Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort .	13414.092008452515
He likes to have his own way very well , replied Colonel Fitzwilliam .	10041.04086419976
It was painful , exceedingly painful , to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return .	7617.402399212963
Yes , thought Elizabeth , that would be a delightful scheme , indeed , and completely do for us at once .	8354.267314847395
but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off .	10110.480380051955
said he hastily , as he opened the door .	11281.989457049014
She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own , but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action , she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage .	7289.464357235634
As often as I can .	14917.800050010435
If you love Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham , you must be very happy .	8077.296908515238
She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas .	10671.791360863139
Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming , without changing colour .	8966.84926822519
1 .	12212.55279990698
You may depend on it , replied the other , for Nicholls was in Meryton last night ;	7997.579404714202
and she could hardly suppress a smile , at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had revolted , in his offer to herself .	7074.688141897248
I told Collins so before you came .	9599.70453419304
I knew , said he , that what I wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary .	7660.068619903715
Why did not you seek legal redress ?	11765.585109008496
When they repaired to the dining-room , Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place , which , in all their former parties , had belonged to him , by her sister .	7937.666040456204
It was necessary to laugh , when she would rather have cried .	7451.44426151961
Soon after you left me on Saturday , I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were .	10261.308843247973
but I always speak what I think .	8565.48810112376
And rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had not Collins thus addressed her , When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ;	7948.701834222141
But that is nothing to us .	9655.337180983419
Our distress , my dear Lizzy , is very great .	12693.381735091034
Not that I mean to find fault with you , for such things I know are all chance in this world .	8462.035825113451
I never saw such capacity , and taste , and application , and elegance , as you describe , united .	7286.012052800811
the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice .	11248.211938418759
found fault with the arrangement of the furniture , or detected the housemaid in negligence ;	12474.483952449365
How can you contrive to write so even ?	9939.453697038349
that my dear mother had more command over herself ;	12821.127359141035
The two first dances , however , brought a return of distress ;	9202.258768871368
The room in which the ladies sat was backwards .	10964.339888361323
My father's opinion of me does me the greatest honour ;	11277.454012184851
It may be easily believed , that however little of novelty could be added to their fears , hopes , and conjectures , on this interesting subject , by its repeated discussion , no other could detain them from it long , during the whole of the journey .	7710.930428385042
but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption !	9088.1918827939
The coach , therefore , took them the first stage of their journey , and brought its master back to Longbourn .	8960.270553785585
cried Jane , what do you mean , Sir ?	11504.197811861637
for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Darcy's steward , and of that , I can assure you , he informed me himself .	7831.14454638999
Her figure was elegant , and she walked well ;	11810.180108915969
I have faults enough , but they are not , I hope , of understanding .	6823.775890424084
but she could not approve him ;	8564.023138762976
and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so full of contradictions and varieties , sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance , and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination .	7075.665505411934
Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections ?	12168.810303038314
CHAPTER I It is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune , must be in want of a wife .	8595.82261166546
I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then Georgiana , unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me .	7863.753942443644
It is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married , continued her mother , but at the same time , Bingley , it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me .	6362.69359644986
And in the first place , let us hear what has happened to you all , since you went away .	7980.972057541996
Besides , it will not much signify what one wears this summer , after the shire have left Meryton , and they are going in a fortnight .	9675.541994913265
His debts are to be paid , amounting , I believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her , and his commission purchased .	8057.0892375478625
He dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday .	9039.039548073975
Her mother's ungraciousness , made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind ;	9252.396204369066
But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes .	7812.709074503203
You are rather disposed to call his interference officious ?	8985.061716757295
and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go , she did not seem to ask for compassion .	7749.052796859302
Whilst wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and Elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of Darcy approaching them , and at no great distance .	9085.939174460376
At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here .	10026.98783371385
and it was but the other day , that I recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her .	6760.268558105691
We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side , said Jane : I hope and trust they will yet be happy .	8209.036687124979
that she had a new gown , or a new parasol , which she would have described more fully , but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry , as Forster called her , and they were going to the camp ;	8275.14577196924
If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement , I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one .	8383.922771584845
And pray may I ask ?	12050.6684746017
I should never be happy without him , so think it no harm to be off .	7779.859263290726
have you heard from my uncle ?	19319.194548643693
He repeated the question , with some surprise at her silence .	10483.103594789805
and a report soon followed that Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly .	8371.741704033357
for she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening , although utterly unknown to her before .	7831.055762766994
and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry her , had she been his relation .	7427.23409345303
As for your Elizabeth's picture , you must not attempt to have it taken , for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes ?	8532.168297495713
It would have suited me in every respect .	8700.257068748444
He immediately offered to fetch her others ;	11890.058404160094
I ought not to have said a word about it .	8877.454986739678
His father was an excellent man , said Gardiner .	11382.442981131837
One ought not to repine ;	16791.120171678296
I cannot catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as I often see done .	7777.347638852481
She was not sorry , however , to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung .	7085.767766870371
the other is Charlotte's marriage .	15944.480704179845
But you How are you ?	10320.463164609033
He danced only four dances , though gentlemen were scarce ;	10754.732647571456
Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ;	8898.509470911484
Good gracious !	13201.627108679078
I am more likely to want time than courage , Elizabeth .	7527.821293936874
And though he exclaimed at the term , she found that it had been pretty much the case .	9484.844126933775
and continually was she repeating , Why is he so altered ?	9846.246103470274
You may well warn me against such an evil .	8447.825013413858
They were of course all intending to be surprised ;	8970.379259669637
my head is always full of something else .	13904.278528637189
She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an inmate of Darcy's house , and mentioned with raptures , some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture .	8094.069363413703
This however was no evil to Elizabeth , and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough ;	9824.735715170405
He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before , on his reading Collins's letter ;	8783.165922868511
Jane , cried Elizabeth , was there a servant belonging to it , who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ?	8812.923324710011
They travelled as expeditiously as possible ;	13145.39897385784
You are a very strange creature by way of a friend !	8173.887878191035
When Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed , which certainly was not unseldom , she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte .	8757.909447767006
The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity ;	7670.6637831351945
Your tempers are by no means unlike .	13591.768443358396
and , after receiving her answer , asked in an hesitating manner how long Darcy had been staying there .	7225.352697520005
His being so sure of succeeding , was wrong , said she ;	10090.93671983813
Allow me to say , Lady Catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application , have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged .	8947.744382362349
GARDINER .	40048.92076156133
and before he went away , an engagement was formed , chiefly through his own and Bennet's means , for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband .	8077.082824878278
you cannot go yourself .	20172.59281792829
That Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham , before his arrival , but without gaining any satisfactory information ;	9690.137025383432
They were in fact very fine ladies ;	9327.07985789191
Well , any friend of Bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure ;	8833.403330737117
Come , let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly .	10122.795973392522
I am , dear Sir , c .	7310.71023087227
or , as the happiest alternative , been secluded from the world , in some distant farm house .	9956.36755652734
And how impossible in others !	13668.867199173823
but of the truth of what I shall relate , I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity .	9013.926548144635
Nay , if you are so serious about it , I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled .	10332.56252430367
Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity , a warmth , a delight , which words could but poorly express .	10206.360174113464
At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ;	7840.369855363508
but from what the report of their engagement could originate , Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ;	8798.071623441643
my dear brother , replied Bennet , that is exactly what I could most wish for .	9143.776762671177
Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude , but said nothing .	8341.588134583742
it is very hard to think that she might have been Collins's wife by this time , had not it been for her own perverseness .	8150.439748536097
He could not speak a word for full ten minutes .	8817.949323498158
If this be the case , he deserves you .	11714.698603972005
His attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect ;	11382.442981131837
It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast ;	10449.03264523202
I am sure you will be very comfortable there .	5853.872274160596
At length the Parsonage was discernible .	11252.259622691683
so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as your's seems to have been .	11343.814559132668
I am afraid you will be angry .	5853.808667894857
He certainly looked at her friend a great deal , but the expression of that look was disputable .	9303.514049327778
She was less handsome than her brother , but there was sense and good humour in her face , and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle .	7585.31183940839
London : Printed for T Egerton , Military Library , Whitehall .	6796.245924649292
and she parted from him convinced , that whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing .	7448.934533639105
I often tell my other girls they are nothing to her .	9115.40633322816
Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction and a moment's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible , she sat down again , and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion .	7620.7452500690015
I am not afraid of you , said he , smilingly .	5237.292965674685
I do not think it is very pretty ;	6195.983530589876
Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he ?	9428.915017007714
1 .	12212.55279990698
but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing , and between herself and Elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to .	8315.572877686462
MY DEAR NIECE , I have just received your letter , and shall devote this whole morning to answering it , as I foresee that a little writing will not comprise what I have to tell you .	8962.641898235475
and , though Kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense , since the disturbers of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended , was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance , by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp .	6986.139648349276
That is capital , added her sister , and they both laughed heartily .	9122.164777105892
Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer , as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces .	8889.46032665222
The girls grieved over such a number of ladies ;	10469.308129063902
said Elizabeth .	14806.870074320834
Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity , are not worth a regret .	10225.421258476446
It is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and interest , for him to be guilty of it .	7302.332211661287
What a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago , would now have been gladly and gratefully received !	8042.900675590961
and I understand from Gardiner , that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all , before she leaves the South .	7540.358157786106
said that she had liked him better when they met in Kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning .	8963.801549342843
We are speaking of music , Madam , said he , when no longer able to avoid a reply .	8703.086921895845
and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you .	6908.553943223613
They are descended on the maternal side , from the same noble line ;	9126.66246642416
And is this all ?	12730.488991316548
They have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression .	9245.834888290556
The boy protested that she should not ;	11757.863351893962
Bennet accepted the challenge , observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements .	9560.990414469401
They have at least that advantage .	11711.63955297944
It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge ;	7627.1100611920065
My father began life in the profession which your uncle , Philips , appears to do so much credit to but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late Darcy , and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property .	7626.17576810976
That will not do for a compliment to Darcy , Caroline , cried her brother because he does not write with ease .	8993.230752212057
Adieu .	36273.99952722278
you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner .	14149.871240318222
but intricate characters are the most amusing .	11670.622208466782
grieved shocked .	32181.680394962303
This , she would not hear of ;	11205.610147237849
It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity ;	7882.951136168981
Hope was over , entirely over ;	19318.963320888248
F3 .	26108.01995875992
She longed to enquire of the housekeeper , whether her master were really absent , but had not courage for it .	8044.233914474057
Darcy was punctual in his return , and as Lydia informed you , attended the wedding .	9228.43672979473
It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's interested wishes , and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes , however openly or artfully spoken , could influence a young man so totally independent of every one .	7877.2102686265935
I will speak to her about it myself directly .	8461.468706036647
Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley ;	10772.923648546495
and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand .	8265.576024173937
The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new , yet I think it is well expressed .	8278.055342478401
The supposition did not pain her .	12282.721584922692
Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense .	9150.662850531276
The latter was thinking only of his breakfast .	9965.585051313266
Their father then went to the library to write , and the girls walked into the breakfast-room .	10260.078158644796
and then , what do you think we did ?	7495.790305608793
he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it ;	10180.969076736697
and , after a pause of several minutes , was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion , who , in a manner , which though it spoke compassion , spoke likewise restraint , said , I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing , concern .	6982.65125087025
and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added , I have never had a cross word from him in my life , and I have known him ever since he was four years old .	7069.47430112815
Wherever you and Jane are known , you must be respected and valued ;	13264.506835618155
but Darcy can please where he chuses .	11064.776739361245
Only think of that my dear ;	13993.525835742228
and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room , its aspect and its furniture , he addressed himself particularly to her , as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him .	6800.897322155061
They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends , and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family , when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window , and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle , driving up the street .	7393.092892684651
But it ought to be done , and if you will give me a sheet of paper , it shall be done directly .	7783.164546689983
The least agreeable circumstance in the business , was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet , whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person .	8335.028388420355
And that , said Reynolds , pointing to another of the miniatures , is my master and very like him .	8781.040246748651
I should not be surprised , said Darcy , if he were to give it up , as soon as any eligible purchase offers .	7553.709581178355
I thought him very sly ;	9914.68917642177
When is your turn to come ?	13864.114698164854
'Lady Catherine , ' said she , 'you have given me a treasure .	13264.206071332375
I shall never forget her appearance this morning .	8551.983309889216
But no , recollecting herself , that could never be : my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me : I should not have been allowed to invite them .	7935.222467974841
We passed each other several times .	13885.562385984762
When they all removed to Brighton , therefore , you had no reason , I suppose , to believe them fond of each other .	8138.831979414939
Her reflections were in general satisfactory .	13478.36292596751
The officers will find women better worth their notice .	10190.200344635912
E2 .	40048.92076156133
Let us sit down .	15217.704332408319
With your good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others !	10200.873734476845
While Sir William was with them , Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig , and shewing him the country ;	9640.156518708363
she felt all the compliment it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother .	8734.284776413584
You have sense , and we all expect you to use it .	8806.600799178044
Their other engagements were few ;	14706.575628310595
Change of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home , may be as useful as anything .	10958.06644820173
Oh yes !	18784.51714306988
I often think , said she , that there is nothing so bad as parting with one's friends .	8428.047831349328
Mary had neither genius nor taste ;	14826.155461711376
1813 .	29757.454875608575
You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner in such society ;	8165.371007837159
and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character , in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of Elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end .	7069.1823454090245
Elizabeth , for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts , now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since her coming away .	7482.5586722471
repeated Bennet .	27062.917040164626
but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment , had they sat in one equally lively ;	7582.122489553216
Oh !	6826.5207498362
She paused , and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse .	8576.202058742027
And to be kept back on such a motive !	10902.725588635589
