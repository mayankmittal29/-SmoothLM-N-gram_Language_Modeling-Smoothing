Average perplexity: 614.4879228969006
I am not at all afraid of her dying .	310.45877491909454
and so accomplished !	436.2637114992168
but without scheming to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery .	448.02466596135775
She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest , by talking of their supposed marriage , and planning his happiness in such an alliance .	790.5106087849304
Hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was very glad ;	442.02864099320936
I told you in the library , you know , that I should never speak to you again , and you will find me as good as my word .	206.28417541374867
The house , furniture , neighbourhood , and roads , were all to her taste , and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most friendly and obliging .	411.9043241130223
and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle directly .	366.8378854205281
If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection , Elizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty .	1226.4803210725108
My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness , and in a cause of such moment as this , I shall certainly not depart from it .	527.3723306005616
The pain of separation , however , might be alleviated on his side , by preparations for the reception of his bride , as he had reason to hope , that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire , the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men .	389.1617637026788
No , I thank you ;	290.2303750642033
I have suspected it some time , but I am now convinced .	301.7368989718907
Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again , and weakened her disgust of Collins .	723.8124894531168
It was unpardonable .	465.48498616665984
No , said Colonel Fitzwilliam , that is an advantage which he must divide with me .	398.09409225895445
and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the probability of a rainy season , made her feel that the commonest , dullest , most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker .	687.2153888702143
Their visitors staid with them above half an hour , and when they arose to depart , Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing and Gardiner , and Miss Bennet , to dinner at Pemberley , before they left the country .	460.03235720978313
But upon my honour I do not .	326.8118787401917
She blushed , and Jane blushed ;	531.4477909832018
I promised them so faithfully !	944.2951232856514
which are naturally lively enough .	807.1910953433478
It was a subject , in short , on which reflection would be long indulged , and must be unavailing .	365.2612689306549
The rooms were lofty and handsome , and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor ;	762.0536584000021
and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour Lady Lucas .	648.6373791573336
but Darcy , at whom it was all aimed , was still inflexibly studious .	546.732067907205
What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosing's Park , when he put his letter into her hand !	765.2360110954608
Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas , for Collins was only a clergyman ;	562.3335156346628
The Collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave ;	640.1750195978675
Do you consider the forms of introduction , and the stress that is laid on them , as nonsense ?	552.8997645311912
As for Jane , her anxiety under this suspence was , of course , more painful than Elizabeth's ;	484.2788321299176
Indeed !	970.8337352433051
and I particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at Netherfield , '_She a beauty !	713.038330289815
I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well , I assure you .	469.8721871247048
and , perhaps , if I have very good luck , I may meet with another Collins in time .	278.49335887033976
From herself to Jane from Jane to Bingley , her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Darcy's explanation there , had appeared very insufficient ;	452.18278500798147
My father , however , is partial to Wickham .	266.2768701773591
The dejection was almost universal .	1248.4963940762823
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper ;	855.7125432575147
But in spite of all this fine talking , my dear Lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured , that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair .	464.33415257971905
No why should he ?	727.4033540100861
As Gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she and her children should go to London , at the same time that Bennet came from it .	272.7499034734918
Yet , how just a humiliation !	934.4529271110445
Nay , when I read a letter of his , I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham , much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law .	502.22355406665594
Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ?	738.7980457630541
Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and which he thought the prettiest ?	632.4931652310618
In the afternoon , the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves ;	613.9901576221542
He has children of his own , and may have more .	229.37648610023209
Family pride , and filial pride , for he is very proud of what his father was , have done this .	360.1856277830448
It was to this effect : Since writing the above , dearest Lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ;	728.1425134789894
Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield , which was fixed for the following Tuesday .	536.5601386760231
This was his plan of amends of atonement for inheriting their father's estate ;	1244.7997856636784
and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached .	695.8457535234686
If you will thank me , he replied , let it be for yourself alone .	341.9538842741264
I hope he will overlook it .	370.6144087695852
Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her .	497.99579636876706
that he should have been in love with her for so many months !	306.5971829126697
She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting .	500.93566561151715
and as she considered that Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations , and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct , she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before .	623.6285006522535
Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again ?	1097.370736930526
She was ashamed to think how much .	329.5543550397993
Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends ?	485.5876930347717
She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference .	556.2415901539888
1813 .	1106.7087699826686
Do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart .	734.5086966200065
and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer !	465.32072939549454
Did you , on reading it , give any credit to its contents ?	502.5726385611855
When tea was over , Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table but in vain .	852.308040114849
Yes , he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word .	420.0051992307892
and Elizabeth found , that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations' consent , there was still something to be wished for .	368.7261873675776
and neither the carriage , nor the livery of the servant who preceded it , were familiar to them .	441.1927432390531
Oh , well !	297.4145192153444
for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ;	359.5190951402911
Is nothing due to me on that score ?	810.4930980826811
but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter and said , Jane , I congratulate you .	190.4151012274628
Bennet's best comfort was , that Bingley must be down again in the summer .	378.115656485538
and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , I never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them .	348.92810160739145
The park paling was still the boundary on one side , and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground .	627.1304300773814
Jane certainly could not come back .	477.4814371108263
To the civil enquiries which then poured in , and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Bingley's , she could not make a very favourable answer .	500.29568099741596
He begged pardon for having displeased her .	1046.2733675760912
But she is nothing to me now .	209.48367422429322
Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time .	443.7585277185395
Miss Darcy , on her brother's entrance , exerted herself much more to talk ;	499.8803379453212
He made no answer , and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton .	355.3930002380438
the nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people !	646.742227797409
If , indeed , it should be so !	207.79543529521095
I cannot fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation .	331.20468865369816
He had rather hoped that all his wife's views on the stranger would be disappointed ;	748.4205375853903
CHAPTER XVI .	1158.202534493978
Her report was highly favourable .	1032.218715289609
Every body said how well she looked ;	708.440390389469
He seemed scarcely to hear her , and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation ;	457.519008607664
They were now almost at the door of the house , for she had walked fast to get rid of him ;	364.49842693704926
He is so excessively handsome !	769.140725439963
for Long has just been here , and she told me all about it .	334.140652262442
where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure ;	578.3954691852716
Darcy , after enquiring of her how and Gardiner did , a question which she could not answer without confusion , said scarcely any thing .	346.77362326561615
They gradually ascended for half a mile , and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence , where the wood ceased , and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House , situated on the opposite side of a valley , into which the road with some abruptness wound .	914.993619865088
He was too happy , however , to need much attention ;	315.4640639643055
Why Jane you never dropt a word of this ;	571.1239992747818
It was all pride and insolence .	472.2052138863747
How does Georgiana get on , Darcy ?	671.3038624742946
At such a distance as that , you know , things are strangely misrepresented .	567.5451555925704
and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted .	799.7089514824855
We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured .	1213.2878141493002
pray make haste and come into the dining-room , for there is such a sight to be seen !	502.26112958468156
When they were gone , Elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent .	450.4540083604563
My dear Eliza he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way .	418.8518327453227
Her ease and good spirits increased .	862.4090522243872
Elizabeth , who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Darcy had been , was much relieved by discerning such different feelings .	593.1652435820274
Oh , yes !	466.4232204347819
, but its volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous locations .	2763.2522783671106
Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship , in spite of a great opposition of character .	461.3591270192195
said Charlotte , as soon as he was gone .	214.12328003024226
There is also one other person in the party , he continued after a pause , who more particularly wishes to be known to you , Will you allow me , or do I ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton ?	450.1567949599761
When a woman has five grown up daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty .	644.6378493666072
cried his wife impatiently .	787.5839682254297
Neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude , replied Elizabeth , have any possible claim on me , in the present instance .	486.8997359543804
and addressed herself particularly to Bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation .	413.055693509075
His manners are very different from his cousin's .	700.5250273688861
But it is so strange !	477.6734987831157
About ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire , to which he belonged .	511.29602740678723
And pray what sort of guardians do you make ?	966.8113974198047
Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in my dressing-room .	629.706836166781
Can you possibly guess , Lizzy , who is meant by this ?	641.5009436660214
You may depend upon my not mentioning it .	601.6632184137915
and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs .	490.7381570041099
and to prevent its ever happening again , took care to inform him at first , that it was a favourite haunt of hers .	591.8745134258044
certainly , cried his faithful assistant , no one can be really esteemed accomplished , who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with .	924.8079800721015
He was writing , and , without raising his head , coolly replied , Just as you please .	514.7776027879266
March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford .	423.3909034267725
Bennet was perfectly satisfied ;	540.1370278052525
When the gentlemen rose to go away , Bennet was mindful of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time .	480.7389814098467
that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking Darcy's character , though he had assured her that respect for the father , would always prevent his exposing the son .	505.18751711819203
His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost .	441.17633644726055
I have not the smallest hope .	233.68706351411296
She coloured as she spoke ;	603.0830993984164
She opened the door , and met Maria in the landing place , who , breathless with agitation , cried out , Oh , my dear Eliza !	496.72006575766414
There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed .	784.1375151953184
You shall hear what she says .	519.3227489911166
I do not see what right Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend's inclination , or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy .	389.3831245446647
A few weeks , he believed .	504.9287392846073
But think no more of the letter .	215.08570663269444
When is your next ball to be , Lizzy ?	370.0803417116814
You see how continually we are engaged there .	821.5181198683481
Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours ;	1822.072968160696
You know I always speak my mind , and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves .	620.213882725173
See paragraph 1 .	2094.73853494803
I am happier even than Jane ;	674.0733790836321
but it must be done soon .	256.44043935876505
they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence ;	723.5444047724616
if it must be so , it must .	155.2657733266494
I should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match , cried Elizabeth .	294.68456882359294
She followed her father to the fire place , and they both sat down .	415.41752223743606
We have judged it best , that my niece should be married from this house , of which I hope you will approve .	420.25124760227555
and , after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable composure .	540.310346647436
Yes , she will remain there till Christmas .	607.379229510005
Special rules , set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license , apply to copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark .	2136.2115416262827
and Gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing , by the servant's account , that their niece was taken suddenly ill ;	620.6383197006991
Remember , Eliza , that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do .	418.8560182911149
but I think I shall like your husband quite as well as Jane's .	421.6233711646099
I do not think we were speaking at all .	286.01945552062693
Well , cried her mother , it is all very right ;	263.54601238396833
and Hurst , principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings , joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss Bennet .	646.1000677908017
Yet he is such a man !	435.3878099960971
You have delighted us long enough .	624.8833207596047
Bennet could hardly contain herself .	680.4278285715386
Be that as it may , she saw him go with regret ;	380.6325914064514
She had even learnt to detect , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary .	637.8249748648082
dear me !	443.40852826575986
when it was no longer likely they should meet .	461.71055391532366
but with the rich , he is liberal-minded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and perhaps agreeable , allowing something for fortune and figure .	429.88390153746803
and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him .	532.2641014826994
You blamed me for coming ?	1058.3755630681171
Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield ;	597.6491377062074
and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look .	399.75471316682365
Have you any idea , Lizzy , who this gentleman is ?	430.7253429108971
It was not in her nature , however , to increase her vexations , by dwelling on them .	300.0171268517696
and even Darcy acknowledged , that the partridges were remarkably well done ;	571.7697209904715
There is something very pompous in his style .	719.4033950386544
You certainly do , she replied with a smile ;	324.5804890861846
and though Collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as I have often told her , to come to Rosings every day , and play on the piano-forte in Jenkinson's room .	340.5930570671541
Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to conciliate her .	737.9925939023911
and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet .	296.001762682355
They contained no actual complaint , nor was there any revival of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering .	1297.3329558196913
Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage ;	1002.1007657852948
Kitty was the only one who shed tears ;	801.2023918342219
And then you have added so much to it yourself , you are always buying books .	464.50701953285585
This cannot be !	515.6536857633176
and Elizabeth , who knew what curiosities his letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise .	378.5632145692602
When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer , I made a point of her having two men servants go with her .	704.849688966455
Elizabeth , on her side , had much to do .	131.71126973203968
The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a headache ;	819.3476543147331
Indeed , Jane , you ought to believe me .	232.34766574778646
And so would Anne , if her health had allowed her to apply .	491.05590191997084
I will read it to you When my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to London , might be concluded in three or four days , but as we are certain it cannot be so , and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town , he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel .	478.0437373365836
They entered it in one of its lowest points , and drove for some time through a beautiful wood , stretching over a wide extent .	1044.0582589286812
May we take my uncle's letter to read to her ?	656.6005264751091
When the card tables were placed , he had an opportunity of obliging her in return , by sitting down to whist .	574.5609389149467
After a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display .	474.9168887930298
but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands .	620.2735232627424
he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and that , if he marry prudently , his wife may teach him .	479.72802585032935
and Bennet , for many years after Lydia's birth , had been certain that he would .	330.88549535172524
and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements , new carriages and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield , in the course of three or four months .	701.5746668359932
hatred had vanished long ago , and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him , that could be so called .	525.9261326633225
But I will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well .	487.5655378555454
If his own vanity , however , did not mislead him , he was the cause , his pride and caprice were the cause of all that Jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer .	329.05137566664683
I fancy , Lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all .	397.5945586234447
Their affectionate mother shared all their grief ;	2166.1113810880533
a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room .	435.1228079672176
Pray , how violent was Bingley's love ?	809.8986098490857
but Lady Catherine very resolutely , and not very politely , declined eating any thing ;	740.533166975193
Now what have you to say ?	387.5902183812546
and in front , a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater , but without any artificial appearance .	810.2858575264447
He carved , and ate , and praised with delighted alacrity ;	923.6580699523007
E5 .	1106.7087699826686
But though every thing seemed neat and comfortable , she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance ;	765.3981942303802
When I am in the country , he replied , I never wish to leave it ;	218.00984107822438
It only shews her being deficient in something herself sense or feeling .	970.1077680580757
Yes , very well .	220.02835011411406
and , though she was not very sanguine in expecting it , the application was a something to look forward to .	280.588707960111
Is this a hint to me , Lizzy , said her father , to send for the horses ?	293.51039846086127
and more than commonly anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her .	684.5191341495406
However , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts , and I am very glad to hear what you tell us , of long sleeves .	411.40642201011747
you know he is , as well as I do ;	169.52312448051725
Pray forgive me , if I have been very presuming , or at least do not punish me so far , as to exclude me from P I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park .	572.4490123605352
Your idea of the ponies is delightful .	637.1280834953509
then recollecting himself , I will not detain you a minute , but let me , or let the servant , go after and Gardiner .	404.62858876968
In the first place , he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron .	573.1585003697106
but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you .	313.408976151905
Bennet could not have chosen better .	420.63152407906387
and know them to be so much attached to me !	257.08706588054264
Her sister made not the smallest objection , and the piano-forte was opened , and Darcy , after a few moments recollection , was not sorry for it .	335.4133533883209
Elizabeth was surprised , but said not a word .	207.68105515408112
CHAPTER X More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park , unexpectedly meet Darcy .	1409.3879650223255
They have none of them much to recommend them , replied he ;	337.9124124572221
After walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on resuming their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant , there chanced to be a little alteration .	717.2386291851461
and Collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much .	856.8036532078786
and yet it should seem by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy .	355.0868191497664
I dare say you believed it ;	395.38571872518224
You are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on ;	375.6647256380379
nothing , therefore , could be fairly conjectured from that , though Elizabeth , who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings , was perfectly aware , that , had she known nothing of Darcy , she could have borne the dread of Lydia's infamy somewhat better .	415.34835552152566
her voice was weak , and her manner affected .	338.7768272556275
Would you believe it , Lizzy , that when he went to town last November , he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent , would have prevented his coming down again !	435.8528736443871
he kissed it with affectionate gallantry , though he hardly knew how to look , and they entered the house .	456.14192140188334
The particulars , I reserve till we meet .	593.9829495718644
and she looked on the whole scene , the river , the trees scattered on its banks , and the winding of the valley , as far as she could trace it , with delight .	430.8157391166782
It was an animating subject , and Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match .	708.8687179158144
Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ;	335.79436862502706
Neither could any thing be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities which Darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach .	700.9124530286102
She then sought her eldest sister , who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley .	559.9477424636277
From Collins !	943.3463593456204
Will you do me the honour of reading that letter ?	530.7008200095127
So , Lizzy , said he one day , your sister is crossed in love I find .	340.71160913273894
Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately ;	263.59368554276347
There was no want of discourse .	466.546366173777
His coming into the country at all , is a most insolent thing indeed , and I wonder how he could presume to do it .	390.350443131394
So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him !	875.479879265853
and he was obliged to walk about the room , while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences .	552.2932625200646
How well it sounds .	807.0325882033342
It should not be said , that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers .	301.4035369883225
and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself ;	415.03048025340837
They found Bennet still up .	625.6744240113145
and they conversed with so much spirit and flow , as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself , as well as of Darcy .	338.3490507760823
But it is , returned she ;	192.85771692640023
He shook his head .	607.2931079533279
His daughter's request , for such it might be considered , of being admitted into her family again , before she set off for the North , received at first an absolute negative .	587.088000703769
Stop me whilst you can .	1156.5970454708636
Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure , and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming , when she found herself so affectionately received .	438.6257777357584
Is it possible !	764.3278322798749
Let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ;	423.42416994394034
He delighted in going to Pemberley , especially when he was least expected .	446.4362872492996
I had no notion but he would go a shooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company .	426.56401475665535
Elizabeth was in agonies .	361.3986624602843
Your uncle is as much surprised as I am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned , would have allowed him to act as he has done .	383.80090605417087
This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted : and Elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away .	557.4080171226713
Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to his wife ?	1169.8802737289134
On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects .	783.1654625237229
An express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from Colonel Forster , to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers ;	596.7076083589435
This has been my motive , my fair cousin , and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem .	488.5761667270788
You ought certainly to forgive them as a christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing .	546.7855446033954
I will not encourage the impudence of either , by receiving them at Longbourn .	420.82096358110016
The next morning , however , made an alteration ;	471.19524415146833
Charlotte is an excellent manager , I dare say .	643.6118120914676
It is evident by this , added Jane , that he comes back no more this winter .	415.74310044584956
To be sure that did seem as if he admired her indeed I rather believe he did I heard something about it but I hardly know what something about Robinson .	623.193251412513
With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ;	581.8090254667353
When she remembered the style of his address , she was still full of indignation ;	496.1360406453981
When first Bennet had married , economy was held to be perfectly useless ;	727.8357783769907
The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came , and Bennet was forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle , was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth .	418.0593052344961
can it be really so !	337.6833403547821
She had never seen a place for which nature had done more , or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste .	690.5204638164781
I hope , added Gardiner , that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her .	346.7847543850716
what can have induced him to behave so cruelly ?	1253.6181339214045
Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications .	1411.8923839889085
His eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity ;	576.7878348224579
As soon as all had ate , and the elder ones paid , the carriage was ordered ;	527.7853325396864
You know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself .	336.2863051027739
Let me hear what it is .	371.22143801045
He meant , I believe , replied Jane , to go to Epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the postilions , and try if any thing could be made out from them .	410.1760761310328
observed Bennet .	409.08893536064124
and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible .	335.35655234447887
The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic .	824.0537405284066
My overhearings were more to the purpose than yours , Eliza , said Charlotte .	522.6058680853622
his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had .	461.1400006399131
said Elizabeth .	176.95448088145562
The first mentioned was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , I had detached Bingley from your sister , and the other , that I had , in defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , ruined the immediate prosperity , and blasted the prospects of Wickham .	419.6170789551666
Darcy is all politeness , said Elizabeth , smiling .	268.0065083796879
said Jane .	216.2887083538018
It was some days , however , before they received any invitation thither , for while there were visitors in the house , they could not be necessary ;	369.3677008597766
Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth and it was soon done done while Bennet was stirring the fire .	429.81481127797053
I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings , and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three , of whom we shall deprive you .	785.9139710714318
It taught me to hope , said he , as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before .	317.77210359145727
but since then , we have both , I hope , improved in civility .	303.0461318722366
but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him .	326.81192885889755
When Jane and Elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in her praise of Bingley before , expressed to her sister how very much she admired him .	316.4040186843809
There can be no love in all this .	306.85122211933066
Yet it is hard , she sometimes thought , that this poor man cannot come to a house , which he has legally hired , without raising all this speculation !	714.7848417269084
and Bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice .	355.1227357385208
Good heavens !	3712.9722009410675
If I had been able , said she , to carry my point of going to Brighton , with all my family , this would not have happened ;	256.4485088271625
Indeed I had .	239.15648970008402
and in the mean time , she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married , to Hill and the two housemaids .	414.6737597259427
Lydia's being settled in the North , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment ;	491.004721428042
The younger ones out before the elder are married !	1205.0012502816435
My excellent father died about five years ago ;	2390.6541794851773
We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening , said Elizabeth .	533.3054757193595
And if you will stay another month complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London , for I am going there early in June , for a week ;	413.6840928929022
Lizzy , you must not do so .	180.67138289313502
Only look at her .	468.5452345485354
and the Hursts have no horses to theirs .	657.4576458885614
She directly replied , You need not be frightened .	538.8408486429206
How nicely we are crammed in !	1782.1138042542661
The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning's impatience .	972.3429316692589

Lizzy , when you first read that letter , I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now .	313.50371032916314
but her's she thought was still worse .	637.661661715546
and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty .	495.8065958844001
But does Lydia know nothing of this ?	460.06183149949356
She counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent ;	984.8831956991505
Can such abominable pride as his , have ever done him good ?	602.3570602524753
Oh !	562.1715257518434
Good Heaven !	2198.1364350490458
Have all her friends left her ?	599.8046837201308
Their brother , indeed , was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency .	332.228613601677
The colour which had been driven from her face , returned for half a minute with an additional glow , and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes , as she thought for that space of time , that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken .	548.779635049573
Pardon me .	693.133449557853
My dear , dear Lizzy , I would I do congratulate you but are you certain ?	348.4401676170782
Her father had been an attorney in Meryton , and had left her four thousand pounds .	535.3408492490481
She had fully proposed being engaged by Wickham for those very dances : and to have Collins instead !	887.3897279698538
I am so grieved for him .	275.9783338887661
She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together .	418.90796214472346
no , I certainly am not .	160.64645558333794
You quite mistook Darcy .	904.3097210846777
but this is the true one .	252.61190085400779
Yes , in conjunction with his friend .	366.586699825711
and still different from either , was what Bennet sent to Collins , in reply to his last .	278.97083111726715
Bingley was every thing that was charming , except the professed lover of her daughter .	424.68996618460335
They repulsed every attempt of Bennet at conversation , and by so doing , threw a languor over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Collins , who was complimenting Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests .	538.3725981894695
As all conversation was thereby at an end , Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room .	583.7784105688058
Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject ;	298.4760548645051
When first he came in , he had spoken to her but little ;	264.2640699620588
If it is designedly done , they cannot be justified ;	670.4853929008286
But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both .	559.5482546076026
and , as they drew near the appointed inn where Bennet's carriage was to meet them , they quickly perceived , in token of the coachman's punctuality , both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs .	773.3029718658869
What , none of you ?	287.3855911913701
Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman , and required information ;	744.2806788303196
Well , my comfort is , I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done .	355.8668750644263
Too much , I am afraid ;	509.9670020945719
This was very amiable , but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any conception of ;	817.6541752066279
His family knew him to be on all common occasions , a most negligent and dilatory correspondent , but at such a time , they had hoped for exertion .	538.12856934844
His first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance , as far as it would go .	345.08407130115927
She wanted to talk , but there seemed an embargo on every subject .	571.6912389102694
In every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived .	706.2063684088317
but on perceiving Darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner .	712.2096745866085
She was more alive to the disgrace , which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham , a fortnight before they took place .	580.1398802075817
and Gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in London the very next day , and would assist Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia .	322.9257523998495
And then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you ;	447.96900949222885
As for Elizabeth , her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last ;	360.5694724423573
They are not married , nor can I find there was any intention of being so ;	386.5142162376954
for you are really proud of your defects in writing , because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution , which if not estimable , you think at least highly interesting .	659.3079501164755
You never will be able to make both of them good for any thing .	335.7568377594934
They walked towards the Lucases , because Kitty wished to call upon Maria ;	876.9106498329655
But you see that Jane , said her aunt , does not think so ill of Wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt .	235.05778639868507
I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ;	341.5107453481057
it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it .	251.03667612001806
The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend , assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London , might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment .	470.6034512678027
She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either , or make either appear to advantage .	513.9969610626704
You allude perhaps to the entail of this estate .	649.7297457932033
She could not win him , however , to any conversation ;	294.57457108524875
by her ease and liveliness , his mind might have been softened , his manners improved , and from his judgment , information , and knowledge of the world , she must have received benefit of greater importance .	393.77346711221475
Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone .	678.9018039529791
I enquired after their brother , of course .	351.36302190835653
Bennet could hardly comprehend it .	469.6971676138895
and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both .	765.2145981703725
Dear me !	1050.2890709447959
by reason , by reflection , by every thing .	290.0517482860474
to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed , and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation , console herself for the present , and prepare for another disappointment .	441.4109691172458
During dinner , Bennet scarcely spoke at all ;	803.4938870788318
To convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself , was no very difficult point .	396.166736244358
my daughters are brought up differently .	906.7078448989018
and after listening a moment , she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry , and calling loudly after her .	762.736504405658
Why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent , said she , did he come at all ?	262.9317807111579
I do think it is the hardest thing in the world , that your estate should be entailed away from your own children ;	457.33571799103294
Bennet treasured up the hint , and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married ;	620.373916554266
Do you know Bingley ?	525.7131548172063
Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy .	827.3498201863631
and very unwillingly said so .	366.20914604402725
Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter ;	844.0474639527645
Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not .	318.74438412413525
He had been some time with Gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river , and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning .	348.540708852081
He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies , of whose beauty he had heard much ;	445.7760144651911
Good God !	3122.225013708037
Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever .	324.6061970204613
Something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them , but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life .	451.75437678635086
it came from Netherfield , and was opened immediately .	295.24164185374946
They have each their advantages , and I can be equally happy in either .	416.79944371187713
She was wild to be at home to hear , to see , to be upon the spot , to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her , in a family so deranged ;	344.689304315776
In making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self-reproach .	538.508009294889
CHAPTER I Elizabeth , as they drove along , watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation ;	712.294852559197
Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance ;	485.76882857520405
And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton , of whom I shall subjoin a list , according to his information .	728.2338051678068
But make a virtue of it by all means .	313.9429188249373
Arguments are too much like disputes .	1706.5510961169475
I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , Lizzy ?	261.8884508040871
The rest of the evening passed with the appearance , on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no farther attempt to distinguish Elizabeth ;	394.0749803036809
I believe , Ma'am , I may safely promise you never to dance with him .	385.56449129318713
No , no .	173.8584919670212
and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least .	842.6995777325004
At length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself .	397.7212724320971
She followed him with her eyes , envied every one to whom he spoke , had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee ;	626.1486043403296
I never saw such a long chin in my life .	495.8490052388921
I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield .	250.2516083729319
cried Elizabeth ;	350.3381256399925
but this was all lost upon me .	349.77288003555276
No , Kitty , I have at last learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it .	288.68708645364205
The principal purport of his letter was to inform them , that Wickham had resolved on quitting the Militia .	598.6880465416641
I shall be very fit to see Jane which is all I want .	333.2246884254376
When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford , every eye was in search of the Parsonage , and every turning expected to bring it in view .	504.9770761820995
her complexion has no brilliancy ;	1076.1667104614578
said her mother as soon as she was in the hall .	210.19324233741148
They will join me early to-morrow , he continued , and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you , Bingley and his sisters .	425.617739856039
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity .	549.3389830522054
I do not mind his not talking to Long , said Miss Lucas , but I wish he had danced with Eliza .	320.8240109520066
but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder .	362.10961971602154
Yes , there can ;	285.9398373168035
If you received the work electronically , the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund .	694.4263481300814
Make haste , make haste .	1354.1424446936235
My reasons for believing it are briefly these : It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance , or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable .	798.0401362445605
After amusing himself some time with their curiosity , he thus explained .	870.3730390665763
I had not believed it possible .	248.47005950919834
Forgive me ;	1130.3984221611265
This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself .	424.12245959788197
Darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say something indistinctly of his concern , and observe her in compassionate silence .	574.3834370055355
At length there was nothing more to be said ;	374.7470375981708
Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ;	1419.444154901768
She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room .	421.4786383783032
But at least it shews , that she was serious in the object of her journey .	295.69555630466454
but , exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone .	1354.800639170371
Elizabeth quietly answered Undoubtedly ;	1894.4091992092372
Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic ;	2370.652087772083
You must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course .	531.0296126815098
I can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ;	590.4201218802348
Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming .	516.3035069195723
I dare say she will ;	321.2487282421396
But self , though it would intrude , could not engross her .	504.7293143265254
His temptation is not adequate to the risk .	767.4232644692551
a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point , without being resented .	822.1185546881046
Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal from the shire , as clearly as Gardiner could do .	497.60713700035126
To Bennet's acknowledgments he briefly replied , with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family ;	722.4629573167513
When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned , in terms of such mortifying , yet merited reproach , her sense of shame was severe .	424.35276214753776
He is now gone into the army , she added , but I am afraid he has turned out very wild .	457.0736812044517
and , after giving each of them an hasty kiss , hurried into the vestibule , where Jane , who came running down stairs from her mother's apartment , immediately met her .	682.768797508115
Take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one .	449.62626811660925
I am most seriously displeased .	817.1598800313767
When they ascended the steps to the hall , Maria's alarm was every moment increasing , and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm .	946.1815415722627
My feelings will not be repressed .	588.6517795491269
Nor was Darcy's vindication , though grateful to her feelings , capable of consoling her for such discovery .	639.1737339128103
All that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds , secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ;	502.94231854408804
My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other .	591.4607369713847
She has known him only a fortnight .	448.9214610774516
I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being .	577.5032481633256
and Elizabeth , as they waited for the housekeeper , had leisure to wonder at her being where she was .	248.1346101484514
Elizabeth , though expecting no less , thanked him with tears of gratitude ;	549.7153190959608
I am sick of them all .	270.42828471827676
You shall not , for the sake of one individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that selfishness is prudence , and insensibility of danger , security for happiness .	537.5852271041758
Elizabeth now began to revive .	582.2088352188684
She received him with her very best politeness , which he returned with as much more , apologising for his intrusion , without any previous acquaintance with her , which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice .	485.8858630448327
Very nonsensical to come at all !	824.7854010866054
Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to identify , do copyright research on , transcribe and proofread public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm collection .	2486.7229685065786
From that moment I observed my friend's behaviour attentively ;	1322.9671056392367
One enjoyment was certain that of suitableness as companions ;	982.6786596712667
And if I am that choice , why may not I accept him ?	411.0698353415311
D The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you can do with this work .	1031.37673306097
Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival , that Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine ;	474.0595012408458
Elizabeth smiled .	375.6391936729077
Such doings discomposed Bennet exceedingly .	3354.498219054948
My sister , who is more than ten years my junior , was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew , Colonel Fitzwilliam , and myself .	444.01995135878946
It suddenly struck her that it might be from lady Catherine ;	511.0366045537233
E8 .	767.3490030902071
Let Wickham be your man .	422.7906653540938
She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it .	829.3148723694495
At last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance of Darcy , with such a smile over the face , as she remembered to have sometimes seen , when he looked at her .	440.19669934443425
and whenever they changed their quarters , either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to , for some little assistance towards discharging their bills .	817.0790996527192
But I must write no more .	319.24322324152945
and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation .	1062.8420701842529
Write to me very often , my dear .	357.9281290168843
She could see him instantly before her , in every charm of air and address ;	411.05277145547075
But , really , I know not what to say .	147.91051380650396
and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it , to Ramsgate ;	567.2237469227432
His plan did not vary on seeing them .	839.9268662412387
Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ?	760.0864183861476
just enough to make one good sort of man ;	470.02673604047726
and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been ;	459.30543050199907
Poor Jane !	1004.9548310947474
The more I see of the world , the more am I dissatisfied with it ;	228.08101226113337
He and his sisters were well , I hope , when you left London .	244.001777259473
International donations are gratefully accepted , but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States .	2345.8536655363996
CHAPTER III .	1158.202534493978
Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect , that the sight of such rooms , so many servants , and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them .	545.6665305668557
Don't keep coughing so , Kitty , for heaven's sake !	1547.6550336489104
Under such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief .	572.2118313293154
and at that moment she felt , that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something !	276.89941910073225
Lord , how ashamed I should be of not being married before three and twenty !	512.6907996380336
She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure .	385.0010907063895
nor could she for many hours , learn to think of it less than incessantly .	472.94781335866963
You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness ;	517.6350930993175
His consenting to marry her is a proof , I will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking .	339.78524626060084
To-morrow fortnight .	1819.32732469942
but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other , of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that Denny had brought him from London , and that he was to have a lieutenant's commission in the shire .	421.3421928279368
It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way .	585.3908553590908
My youngest of all , is lately married , and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds , walking with a young man , who I believe will soon become a part of the family .	398.7135532437775
They were then , with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance , taken into the house ;	523.6122409092483
But Elizabeth , who had not the least inclination to remain with them , laughingly answered , No , no ;	323.68993667949036
and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement .	429.26964500445445
All field sports were over .	2363.8371263310532
My style of writing is very different from yours .	863.4591114294351
c .	468.9532158949242
and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror , Gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power .	673.5101441273446
Thus , we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition .	1700.4287004436244
She wrote even to Jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her former professions of regard .	413.38581756652104
CHAPTER X The day passed much as the day before had done .	644.5421027892143
He merely added , that he should not write again , till he had something of importance to mention .	342.27070327790915
It originated in Gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support , and consequently preferred her husband's .	698.0288101370564
After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with It is your turn to say something now , Darcy .	457.3549103240072
and his commendation of every thing would have touched Bennet's heart , but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property .	601.7236869853988
She comes to us to-day .	613.9487654981197
I will not tell you what it is .	190.3194840500163
At length however Bennet had no more to say ;	480.66232344347037
The power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor , and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance .	616.9468001849993
Then turning to Bennet , he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon .	844.4880936978836
The subjection in which his father had brought him up , had given him originally great humility of manner , but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head , living in retirement , and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity .	688.2067226979862
From the entrance hall , of which Collins pointed out , with a rapturous air , the fine proportion and finished ornaments , they followed the servants through an anti-chamber , to the room where Lady Catherine , her daughter , and Jenkinson were sitting .	601.062153139771
and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over .	491.66069194550164
Now , said she , that this first meeting is over , I feel perfectly easy .	358.72221338830013
The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited .	549.5477215462009
After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight , and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear ;	660.6769101469943
What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy ?	461.00440391377794
Lydia was exceedingly fond of him .	371.5798254615555
When coffee was over , Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him ;	674.643420371042
I do not believe she often sees such at home .	439.27746426468144
A clergyman like you must marry .	851.4478149706675
But gracious me !	820.1746000557422
It was agreed to .	240.8497886429476
But she would not be secure .	264.56366654050515
Though I shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ;	776.096143242001
You are so strange !	753.5731435818034
Having resolved to do it without loss of time , as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday , and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment , he set about it in a very orderly manner , with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business .	474.6701041754184
E GARDINER .	3066.6096236029525
For my own part , she rejoined , I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her .	380.0745168986771
and in the evening Bennet's invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter .	416.62134835757286
Yes , always , she replied , without knowing what she said , for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , I remember hearing you once say , Darcy , that you hardly ever forgave , that your resentment once created was unappeasable .	494.04306561244937
my sweetest Lizzy !	1432.1926127087866
And I think you will agree with me , in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece's .	551.9782113466473
Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations ;	1048.316946642383
CHAPTER XVIII .	1158.202534493978
F6 .	1106.7087699826686
that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her , and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening .	399.5894269917862
CHAPTER III .	1158.202534493978
What a charming amusement for young people this is , Darcy !	542.4361307782672
I remember , as soon as ever I saw him , when he first came into Hertfordshire last year , I thought how likely it was that you should come together .	360.56915427537706
But it is all , all too late now .	268.9034771674263
and Bennet found , with amazement and horror , that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter .	543.0373213608995
She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse , but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other , and how formal and cold was their manner , whenever they did .	405.2381132133354
No one who has ever seen you together , can doubt his affection .	515.6223054399087
Elizabeth listened as little as she could , but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name .	458.8547462933313
that it should be equally unreserved was impossible .	510.82980544979
It is because he will not give himself the trouble .	362.9383633498057
Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself , and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam , Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word I say .	408.6213247662446
He is perfectly well behaved , polite , and unassuming , said her uncle .	448.6837175708781
You have reduced him to his present state of poverty , comparative poverty .	948.5005493442588
Nearly three weeks .	1964.04328458128
Oh !	562.1715257518434
His appearance was greatly in his favour ;	648.3135815600842
I have sent for you on an affair of importance .	354.0828400910586
When to these recollections was added the developement of Wickham's character , it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before , were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful .	618.3366861306073
but Ashworth is too far off !	1188.734516344254
She now lost every expectation of pleasure .	563.4665555485542
Miss Bennet , replied her ladyship , in an angry tone , you ought to know , that I am not to be trifled with .	254.08902465217014
for I consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman .	727.6489161167177
On reaching the spacious lobby above , they were shewn into a very pretty sitting-room , lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below ;	1999.0165297783471
You know pretty well , I suppose , what has been done for the young people .	340.62168713525494
At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted .	1765.089349777545
I never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong .	612.29410920994
Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible .	652.8641318879462
Elizabeth silently attended her .	647.8337843131595
Oh , Jane , take care .	255.03251836667062
Oh !	562.1715257518434
' But afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time .	451.2192265024795
She examined into their employments , looked at their work , and advised them to do it differently ;	612.3700307559109
CHAPTER XI .	1158.202534493978
unless you looked up to him as a superior .	363.1246116805804
I have therefore made up my mind to tell you , that I do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare .	406.51025186726736
and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William , in which she was readily joined by Jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of Collins , and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London .	380.24986176003586
Who do you mean , my dear ?	493.5113057995539
Though Bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage .	363.5611896462116
how can it affect them ?	762.9863877121771
They had nothing to accuse him of but pride ;	426.77833478011325
He was coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland : when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey .	492.55764538518076
Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game , except when Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh's being too hot or too cold , or having too much or too little light .	1031.1295700699632
but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future .	379.11948610078093

He scarcely ever spoke to her , and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself , were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas , whose civility in listening to him , was a seasonable relief to them all , and especially to her friend .	324.01335135534987
CHAPTER VIII .	1158.202534493978
When at length they arose to take leave , Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn ;	610.4161285413599
I could see him with perfect indifference , but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of .	525.1609543678486
I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes .	1096.6375174229397
and the two , who were most anxiously expected , to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen , were in very good time .	365.2662785560994
No one but Bennet , regretted that their stay would be so short ;	524.7241392228186
Lydia has no brothers to step forward ;	1071.446122654809
CHAPTER XII .	1158.202534493978
Well , mamma , said she , when they were all returned to the breakfast room , and what do you think of my husband ?	265.77497271914444
'Tis as good as a Lord !	789.4081558325936
forgive the question are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ?	488.91073240482797
and therefore gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent , his actions were capable of a very different construction ;	381.66526275137284
But what is that to me ?	214.61322099993774
a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade .	1248.4945789375106
To fortune I am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since I am well aware that it could not be complied with ;	498.12677921093456
Girls , can I do any thing for you in Meryton ?	407.0597455165302
[ Illustration : Morning Dress .	6631.953871070331
But the wife of Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation , that she could , upon the whole , have no cause to repine .	414.753641907213
Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table , and they went up stairs together .	492.80593442154077
Your alliance will be a disgrace ;	981.455488919156
I have every reason in the world to think ill of you .	214.88382901174072
Elizabeth immediately recognising the livery , guessed what it meant , and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations , by acquainting them with the honour which she expected .	663.1390900258049
At present , indeed , they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood ;	623.5592193106515
The world has been deceived in that respect ;	575.0374747988902
Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility ;	392.3487670133354
He must write his own sermons ;	938.96760078903
which will not be yours till after your mother's decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to .	495.04448858719815
She stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation , and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery .	737.890393847803
Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ?	723.4659732750151
Miss Darcy's praise occupied the chief of it .	625.2684562932569
Recovering himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said , Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of .	482.3871861788632
Is her husband , is the son of his late father's steward , to be his brother ?	416.7526596411301
Lady Catherine approached , and , after listening for a few minutes , said to Darcy , Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss , if she practised more , and could have the advantage of a London master .	353.5894851856662
but Sir William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane , who were dancing together .	629.6336103264965
How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell , but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you .	572.7185253592683
Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother .	478.12183821969955
Certainly , replied Elizabeth there are such people , but I hope I am not one of them .	264.49111022256926
See paragraph 1 .	2094.73853494803
I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did .	361.1471405121984
Had his own happiness , however , been the only sacrifice , he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best ;	398.2392880531958
And with a bow to Darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room .	385.0578231626721
She would not betray her trust , I suppose , without bribery and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be found .	406.9057859322273
but they were now necessary , and she assured him with some confusion , of her attachment to Darcy .	254.05813657969185
All was acknowledged , and half the night spent in conversation .	438.54771425374315
If we are ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been , said Elizabeth , and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what Gardiner has done for them , because Wickham has not sixpence of his own .	473.75582965070356
Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father .	425.8804807188473
Hunsford , near Westerham , Kent , 15th October .	1338.5406600988224
Bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from London , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time .	467.7534411911219
and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life .	298.20000739713083
I would keep a pack of foxhounds , and drink a bottle of wine every day .	799.5504291710748
Now , seriously , what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence ?	590.6019564165417
and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to elope with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ;	517.4934124856244
Must it be so ?	624.1928736550653
These bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had I with greater policy concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified , unalloyed inclination ;	1386.1465683287784
I hope she will turn out well .	389.9777520341567
Teaze him laugh at him .	705.5143088379181
She danced four dances with him at Meryton ;	939.4418411726772
While the contents of the first letter remained on her mind , she was all surprise all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl , whom it was impossible he could marry for money ;	439.33331675508043
Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start , and before he could recover himself enough to speak , she , in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's situation , hastily exclaimed , I beg your pardon , but I must leave you .	638.4888372896045
I know not , Miss Elizabeth , said he , whether Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us , but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it .	309.35575200837144
And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection .	555.453449775109
Any place would do , of about three or four hundred a year ;	791.9305756768449
The note was immediately dispatched , and its contents as quickly complied with .	1066.0999614411264
and when it closed , Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon Charlotte's degree of contentment , to understand her address in guiding , and composure in bearing with her husband , and to acknowledge that it was all done very well .	464.4369711795033
But no letter appeared , and she was completely puzzled .	489.5631490874049
This was a lucky idea of mine , indeed !	548.0472961119449
but it is not sound .	276.5485401395273
What is his name ?	537.0224144766026
Reynolds , either from pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister .	499.15822620607264
Her look and manners were open , cheerful and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and I remained convinced from the evening's scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment .	615.4455151021178
Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer , and forced his younger sister to be civil also , and say what the occasion required .	471.2335942218307
Every thing that is charming !	722.4884753911944
and after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do , which was the more probable from the time of year .	427.0016285212844
Brother-in-law of Wickham !	881.2494372466493
Happy shall I be , when his stay at Netherfield is over !	501.45757244046155
Miss Darcy was tall , and on a larger scale than Elizabeth ;	494.28054322276563
At present we have nothing to guide us .	761.5453646084583
The account of his connection with the Pemberley family , was exactly what he had related himself ;	393.6715829776534
Your sisters are engaged , and there is not another woman in the room , whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with .	315.62342040285625
When I wrote that letter , replied Darcy , I believed myself perfectly calm and cool , but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit .	540.157500288834
The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth , as the first .	391.87620968005996
We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Wickham with money .	830.3848644621671
As soon as they had driven from the door , Elizabeth was called on by her cousin , to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings , which , for Charlotte's sake , she made more favourable than it really was .	303.54184453398625
They may wish many things besides his happiness ;	1030.0791638500652
I must conclude , for I cannot be long from my poor mother .	363.5216865109567
cried Elizabeth , brightening up for a moment .	441.3259002718414
But however he did not .	242.34102274328265
Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Hurst or Miss Bingley ;	826.3066105961174
Your friend performs delightfully ;	3247.35230147304
and the valley , here contracted into a glen , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it .	1054.205691324546
They could talk of nothing but officers ;	521.0189710643593
Their conduct has been such , replied Elizabeth , as neither you , nor I , nor any body , can ever forget .	343.72554124845624
She had obtained private intelligence that Darcy did not wish for cards ;	849.3741667803221
why is not every body as happy ?	551.7214188667621
nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable .	465.15451204884334
He had never before supposed that , could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter , it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself , as by the present arrangement .	339.63889620658875
Kitty stared at him , and Lydia exclaimed .	466.9691808477797
Elizabeth could not help saying , It is very much to his credit , I am sure , that you should think so .	229.5580991698162
On their being joined by Bingley himself , Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas ;	573.2564485119209
Wickham passed all his youth there , you know .	344.2490978751449
As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , I shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females .	642.1174410153513
Very little was said by either ;	515.6504743028552
repeated Elizabeth , in utter amazement .	572.3906269908836
her liveliness had been never worse timed .	1177.64515637957
Perhaps it will be as well , if you discourage his coming here so very often .	454.5347372704534
CHAPTER V Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate .	1170.6593075919834
She retreated from the window , fearful of being seen ;	665.3763231612011
he sustained it however with fortitude , and so far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into conversation with Gardiner .	492.5230019283054
She shared in their attendance on Bennet , and was a great comfort to them , in their hours of freedom .	352.4832437542703
Does he know his real character ?	910.9616551272288
In her kind schemes for Elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam .	718.853537063679
We shall often meet , I hope , in Hertfordshire .	324.2579155158145
replied Kitty , it looks just like that man that used to be with him before .	362.8041818144637
If you were to give me forty such men , I never could be so happy as you .	339.3893353310055
She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious , made no other reply to Elizabeth's salutation , than a slight inclination of the head , and sat down without saying a word .	619.882040381048
He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever , on the occasion .	483.91872937601846
What is to become of us !	437.22094516848904
It was kindly meant .	630.681715663427
Lydia declared herself satisfied .	826.3381763459364
My sister , I am sure , will not hear of her removal .	249.9242639993988
The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities , though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings ;	693.6782370711082
If it was not for the entail I should not mind it .	243.28018648512656
And then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it .	273.58926329305655
They have some of the finest woods in the country .	456.96402309319166
Oh !	562.1715257518434
What did you say of me , that I did not deserve ?	286.67308382480127
You forget that I have made no answer .	396.9110702550294
Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility .	726.110673120939
Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied , Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully .	796.323428425441
I know not what to think .	160.94208481013771
Bennet could not give her consent , or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , though she talked to Bingley of nothing else , for half an hour ;	453.0347403961634
She knew not what to think , nor how to account for it .	251.15771520136028
So much the better .	400.87457767763476
You wanted me , I know , to say 'Yes , ' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste ;	426.2537921140781
It is admirable !	952.386443542353
They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which I cannot wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects .	504.04001150390445
pride he probably had , and if not , it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town , where the family did not visit .	377.4873150736463
But , Lizzy , you can tell us whether it is like or not .	289.6433448823844
and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's dying an old maid .	1374.2098930421505
The wisest and the best of men , nay , the wisest and best of their actions , may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke .	613.8724245266538
Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper ;	642.1860376483027
and it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning , and never said a word about it till now .	283.2213637020768
After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room , from the sideboard to the fender , to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London , Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden , which was large and well laid out , and to the cultivation of which he attended himself .	435.3812124319149
I should infinitely prefer a book .	877.1116609635509
but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless Darcy returned within the stated time .	707.9848788080334
This is not to be borne .	305.2202808126269
Had his first appearance , or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining , been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Darcy , the gardener's expression of surprise , on beholding his master , must immediately have told it .	484.99611137754283
Hurst had therefore nothing to do , but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep .	437.20001764766243
I thought it would never be over ;	303.84057254524265
But if I do not take your likeness now , I may never have another opportunity .	447.89029238126
Elizabeth made no answer , and walked on , her heart swelling with indignation .	438.49179311678796
And do you like her ?	376.4091390991218
It was an evening of no common delight to them all ;	378.6907631319229
I never can be thankful , Bennet , for any thing about the entail .	305.19908906391544
Were the same fair prospect to arise at present , as had flattered them a year ago , every thing , she was persuaded , would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion .	594.5100264737828
He danced only four dances !	1948.6746214046232
I have not a doubt of Bingley's sincerity , said Elizabeth warmly ;	423.4149202173222
Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother , on his approaching marriage , were all that was affectionate and insincere .	409.38757328611456
Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort .	346.07865615029954
He likes to have his own way very well , replied Colonel Fitzwilliam .	457.2741296331441
It was painful , exceedingly painful , to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return .	474.2147839275475
Yes , thought Elizabeth , that would be a delightful scheme , indeed , and completely do for us at once .	300.0048447145503
but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off .	738.8441278109805
said he hastily , as he opened the door .	322.49634929699977
She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own , but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action , she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage .	614.2840025216803
As often as I can .	319.51861636194735
If you love Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham , you must be very happy .	311.79239843783995
She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas .	372.8807809491186
Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming , without changing colour .	421.0213450478346
1 .	337.86237211289136
You may depend on it , replied the other , for Nicholls was in Meryton last night ;	412.8540930415502
and she could hardly suppress a smile , at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had revolted , in his offer to herself .	428.34971930508726
I told Collins so before you came .	335.7109870558695
I knew , said he , that what I wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary .	228.15456659808186
Why did not you seek legal redress ?	2164.480283006434
When they repaired to the dining-room , Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place , which , in all their former parties , had belonged to him , by her sister .	380.30455170062635
It was necessary to laugh , when she would rather have cried .	330.2201762474567
Soon after you left me on Saturday , I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were .	479.5985658001437
but I always speak what I think .	272.8887060105642
And rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had not Collins thus addressed her , When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ;	436.2268107251737
But that is nothing to us .	207.493320704796
Our distress , my dear Lizzy , is very great .	391.8596263558793
Not that I mean to find fault with you , for such things I know are all chance in this world .	396.4750052208187
I never saw such capacity , and taste , and application , and elegance , as you describe , united .	358.33540216605206
the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice .	390.5417680156449
found fault with the arrangement of the furniture , or detected the housemaid in negligence ;	956.3362731082332
How can you contrive to write so even ?	804.2192304796084
that my dear mother had more command over herself ;	572.5712067886
The two first dances , however , brought a return of distress ;	502.66522249967403
The room in which the ladies sat was backwards .	500.860630798187
My father's opinion of me does me the greatest honour ;	653.8543383158667
It may be easily believed , that however little of novelty could be added to their fears , hopes , and conjectures , on this interesting subject , by its repeated discussion , no other could detain them from it long , during the whole of the journey .	462.81431733810774
but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption !	1237.437505333917
The coach , therefore , took them the first stage of their journey , and brought its master back to Longbourn .	509.38347342018056
cried Jane , what do you mean , Sir ?	336.0363970244543
for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Darcy's steward , and of that , I can assure you , he informed me himself .	317.2330258218858
Her figure was elegant , and she walked well ;	478.9136064364019
I have faults enough , but they are not , I hope , of understanding .	206.26696196841175
but she could not approve him ;	349.7271676027463
and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so full of contradictions and varieties , sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance , and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination .	839.76848501805
Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections ?	696.7069084438818
CHAPTER I It is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune , must be in want of a wife .	411.13436657682666
I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then Georgiana , unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me .	530.0364991439891
It is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married , continued her mother , but at the same time , Bingley , it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me .	228.233359936171
And in the first place , let us hear what has happened to you all , since you went away .	364.86283357773505
Besides , it will not much signify what one wears this summer , after the shire have left Meryton , and they are going in a fortnight .	546.6567132928342
His debts are to be paid , amounting , I believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her , and his commission purchased .	506.9242550839005
He dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday .	501.40142497602477
Her mother's ungraciousness , made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind ;	792.8907238198123
But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes .	581.7650116079185
You are rather disposed to call his interference officious ?	1281.4111674527376
and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go , she did not seem to ask for compassion .	528.6926126466831
Whilst wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and Elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of Darcy approaching them , and at no great distance .	450.42645064192175
At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here .	635.8936332268921
and it was but the other day , that I recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her .	301.1781789311567
We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side , said Jane : I hope and trust they will yet be happy .	534.685869386769
that she had a new gown , or a new parasol , which she would have described more fully , but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry , as Forster called her , and they were going to the camp ;	441.02532062177715
If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement , I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one .	423.5851600808143
And pray may I ask ?	881.826677532384
I should never be happy without him , so think it no harm to be off .	308.37962874492496
have you heard from my uncle ?	415.8591468163139
He repeated the question , with some surprise at her silence .	390.09192165715945
and a report soon followed that Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly .	570.0806991408318
for she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening , although utterly unknown to her before .	536.1505441079989
and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry her , had she been his relation .	334.60754121914124
As for your Elizabeth's picture , you must not attempt to have it taken , for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes ?	605.6115144891578
It would have suited me in every respect .	536.8613330461632
He immediately offered to fetch her others ;	933.0759131960812
I ought not to have said a word about it .	231.13900419022022
His father was an excellent man , said Gardiner .	434.04900142501566
One ought not to repine ;	851.5880567112273
I cannot catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as I often see done .	565.0190005533437
She was not sorry , however , to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung .	351.0014097541276
the other is Charlotte's marriage .	379.1454854869015
But you How are you ?	364.06064430274193
He danced only four dances , though gentlemen were scarce ;	1411.7877762498795
Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ;	637.4495500035109
Good gracious !	2358.8718659881183
I am more likely to want time than courage , Elizabeth .	360.2083395708388
And though he exclaimed at the term , she found that it had been pretty much the case .	414.1001976552538
and continually was she repeating , Why is he so altered ?	558.752211155137
You may well warn me against such an evil .	919.0124713791395
They were of course all intending to be surprised ;	466.66712714098185
my head is always full of something else .	581.029058974256
She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an inmate of Darcy's house , and mentioned with raptures , some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture .	707.9816306742954
This however was no evil to Elizabeth , and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough ;	470.96876439013647
He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before , on his reading Collins's letter ;	733.0740630328596
Jane , cried Elizabeth , was there a servant belonging to it , who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ?	316.3253342075843
They travelled as expeditiously as possible ;	1582.2365481097913
You are a very strange creature by way of a friend !	533.5813101024543
When Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed , which certainly was not unseldom , she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte .	635.0318559817139
The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity ;	515.9960589607767
Your tempers are by no means unlike .	1387.138082238063
and , after receiving her answer , asked in an hesitating manner how long Darcy had been staying there .	497.7534705856747
His being so sure of succeeding , was wrong , said she ;	345.16344569626455
Allow me to say , Lady Catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application , have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged .	524.750001705706
GARDINER .	1106.7087699826686
and before he went away , an engagement was formed , chiefly through his own and Bennet's means , for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband .	463.84325512037236
you cannot go yourself .	445.2815003553289
That Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham , before his arrival , but without gaining any satisfactory information ;	721.6300881574335
They were in fact very fine ladies ;	689.2245531795833
Well , any friend of Bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure ;	432.6796896928805
Come , let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly .	1271.1850028742294
I am , dear Sir , c .	231.63553727060946
or , as the happiest alternative , been secluded from the world , in some distant farm house .	569.1505963850071
And how impossible in others !	695.0818451247326
but of the truth of what I shall relate , I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity .	672.5742333222912
Nay , if you are so serious about it , I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled .	458.004911657048
Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity , a warmth , a delight , which words could but poorly express .	647.1543328423587
At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ;	538.9053137656068
but from what the report of their engagement could originate , Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ;	401.4576611557557
my dear brother , replied Bennet , that is exactly what I could most wish for .	282.9040909369086
Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude , but said nothing .	450.8266071745461
it is very hard to think that she might have been Collins's wife by this time , had not it been for her own perverseness .	320.6198870986171
He could not speak a word for full ten minutes .	591.3296059028778
If this be the case , he deserves you .	289.800833731798
His attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect ;	1090.1391708152396
It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast ;	511.7665460905292
I am sure you will be very comfortable there .	333.3884282618981
At length the Parsonage was discernible .	992.2303840859007
so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as your's seems to have been .	735.8648208269514
I am afraid you will be angry .	344.36176461383104
He certainly looked at her friend a great deal , but the expression of that look was disputable .	415.3970653444394
She was less handsome than her brother , but there was sense and good humour in her face , and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle .	434.89281675530276
London : Printed for T Egerton , Military Library , Whitehall .	2535.501701100354
and she parted from him convinced , that whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing .	382.4775854021844
I often tell my other girls they are nothing to her .	328.7161850012458
Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction and a moment's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible , she sat down again , and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion .	773.8178334270311
I am not afraid of you , said he , smilingly .	206.10993545243485
I do not think it is very pretty ;	296.17580836587746
Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he ?	329.5221543917173
1 .	337.86237211289136
but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing , and between herself and Elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to .	303.5605658929252
MY DEAR NIECE , I have just received your letter , and shall devote this whole morning to answering it , as I foresee that a little writing will not comprise what I have to tell you .	613.0306077609633
and , though Kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense , since the disturbers of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended , was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance , by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp .	632.3436058875658
That is capital , added her sister , and they both laughed heartily .	516.2750340588873
Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer , as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces .	516.0211545301983
The girls grieved over such a number of ladies ;	791.6057221561302
said Elizabeth .	176.95448088145562
Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity , are not worth a regret .	952.1285916527346
It is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and interest , for him to be guilty of it .	361.6820107501487
What a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago , would now have been gladly and gratefully received !	658.306620814879
and I understand from Gardiner , that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all , before she leaves the South .	419.5488057080079
said that she had liked him better when they met in Kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning .	353.88689277205333
We are speaking of music , Madam , said he , when no longer able to avoid a reply .	423.6562365341135
and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you .	328.80002270587954
They are descended on the maternal side , from the same noble line ;	939.1911454239766
And is this all ?	352.83315413117987
They have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression .	523.0539519652607
The boy protested that she should not ;	610.6562045825833
Bennet accepted the challenge , observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements .	978.0279429528398
They have at least that advantage .	385.5703968061798
It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge ;	502.3368655790245
My father began life in the profession which your uncle , Philips , appears to do so much credit to but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late Darcy , and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property .	392.26588364407996
That will not do for a compliment to Darcy , Caroline , cried her brother because he does not write with ease .	383.5347020608006
Adieu .	1106.7087699826686
you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner .	475.4491036576863
but intricate characters are the most amusing .	1294.0220737433258
grieved shocked .	1283.0342424995447
This , she would not hear of ;	193.1536987017479
It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity ;	1000.9632277440802
Hope was over , entirely over ;	762.4136386754402
F3 .	689.5423780060422
She longed to enquire of the housekeeper , whether her master were really absent , but had not courage for it .	429.9522155898809
Darcy was punctual in his return , and as Lydia informed you , attended the wedding .	340.897197854131
It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's interested wishes , and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes , however openly or artfully spoken , could influence a young man so totally independent of every one .	719.6778712511732
I will speak to her about it myself directly .	306.0128120574894
Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley ;	903.0505159096198
and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand .	439.713899452637
The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new , yet I think it is well expressed .	636.0644277762699
The supposition did not pain her .	545.3555616054205
Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense .	608.4952701824534
The latter was thinking only of his breakfast .	466.8810606284752
Their father then went to the library to write , and the girls walked into the breakfast-room .	428.99109776489536
and then , what do you think we did ?	266.59550155407527
he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it ;	302.4987665778435
and , after a pause of several minutes , was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion , who , in a manner , which though it spoke compassion , spoke likewise restraint , said , I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing , concern .	386.9307741930926
and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added , I have never had a cross word from him in my life , and I have known him ever since he was four years old .	427.66850431909114
Wherever you and Jane are known , you must be respected and valued ;	571.5912795257082
but Darcy can please where he chuses .	686.312228898773
Only think of that my dear ;	398.3014448315436
and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room , its aspect and its furniture , he addressed himself particularly to her , as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him .	435.4985120798274
They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends , and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family , when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window , and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle , driving up the street .	459.67782589468965
But it ought to be done , and if you will give me a sheet of paper , it shall be done directly .	333.09218860808085
The least agreeable circumstance in the business , was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet , whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person .	440.821973310189
And that , said Reynolds , pointing to another of the miniatures , is my master and very like him .	323.5156021833114
I should not be surprised , said Darcy , if he were to give it up , as soon as any eligible purchase offers .	316.632549971419
I thought him very sly ;	515.2981147406754
When is your turn to come ?	540.0883669544227
'Lady Catherine , ' said she , 'you have given me a treasure .	835.32248646438
I shall never forget her appearance this morning .	521.4218818561254
But no , recollecting herself , that could never be : my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me : I should not have been allowed to invite them .	366.5825472554405
We passed each other several times .	1219.5266553245806
When they all removed to Brighton , therefore , you had no reason , I suppose , to believe them fond of each other .	296.24621927638384
Her reflections were in general satisfactory .	932.7272146288137
The officers will find women better worth their notice .	1242.9511107369794
E2 .	1106.7087699826686
Let us sit down .	1070.4687575040277
With your good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others !	624.5176939112304
While Sir William was with them , Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig , and shewing him the country ;	701.1178886529432
she felt all the compliment it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother .	312.573504313405
You have sense , and we all expect you to use it .	269.51121703936667
Their other engagements were few ;	965.4393957945405
Change of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home , may be as useful as anything .	652.3812619797371
Oh yes !	1094.6807022876728
I often think , said she , that there is nothing so bad as parting with one's friends .	384.30120462806923
Mary had neither genius nor taste ;	2087.5860469969316
1813 .	1106.7087699826686
You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner in such society ;	764.9667826070372
and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character , in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of Elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end .	446.8967093829507
Elizabeth , for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts , now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since her coming away .	464.6886987357287
repeated Bennet .	450.1963553602471
but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment , had they sat in one equally lively ;	459.85833782491954
Oh !	562.1715257518434
She paused , and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse .	884.744329469221
And to be kept back on such a motive !	526.8844575679406
