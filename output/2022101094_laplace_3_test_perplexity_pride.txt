Average perplexity: 7893.407115064067
I am not at all afraid of her dying .	4281.006848989661
and so accomplished !	8956.978848147834
but without scheming to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery .	6529.217895107055
She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest , by talking of their supposed marriage , and planning his happiness in such an alliance .	7814.1904346167385
Hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was very glad ;	6739.257962157755
I told you in the library , you know , that I should never speak to you again , and you will find me as good as my word .	3397.6325184571547
The house , furniture , neighbourhood , and roads , were all to her taste , and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most friendly and obliging .	7358.23948419415
and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle directly .	4906.199914956763
If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection , Elizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty .	8852.95887912076
My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness , and in a cause of such moment as this , I shall certainly not depart from it .	4615.771586146531
The pain of separation , however , might be alleviated on his side , by preparations for the reception of his bride , as he had reason to hope , that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire , the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men .	4342.929382799451
No , I thank you ;	6273.692988699223
I have suspected it some time , but I am now convinced .	3985.3219260417145
Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again , and weakened her disgust of Collins .	9503.738370011939
It was unpardonable .	7537.809773168527
No , said Colonel Fitzwilliam , that is an advantage which he must divide with me .	4780.35601869024
and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the probability of a rainy season , made her feel that the commonest , dullest , most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker .	5056.150569151539
Their visitors staid with them above half an hour , and when they arose to depart , Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing and Gardiner , and Miss Bennet , to dinner at Pemberley , before they left the country .	4447.4832576429
But upon my honour I do not .	4858.560312197641
She blushed , and Jane blushed ;	9593.50595345749
I promised them so faithfully !	11617.086358507197
which are naturally lively enough .	15051.736510671968
It was a subject , in short , on which reflection would be long indulged , and must be unavailing .	4544.186926633718
The rooms were lofty and handsome , and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor ;	7955.491780720523
and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour Lady Lucas .	5216.752543321425
but Darcy , at whom it was all aimed , was still inflexibly studious .	8194.136228448486
What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosing's Park , when he put his letter into her hand !	7375.693767184652
Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas , for Collins was only a clergyman ;	7571.049058450876
The Collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave ;	8738.382783129815
Do you consider the forms of introduction , and the stress that is laid on them , as nonsense ?	7162.960388854175
As for Jane , her anxiety under this suspence was , of course , more painful than Elizabeth's ;	7307.941433505911
Indeed !	26754.44043837987
and I particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at Netherfield , '_She a beauty !	5954.005995194834
I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well , I assure you .	3987.5692096001944
and , perhaps , if I have very good luck , I may meet with another Collins in time .	4345.187868407973
From herself to Jane from Jane to Bingley , her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Darcy's explanation there , had appeared very insufficient ;	7499.78918997213
My father , however , is partial to Wickham .	5004.73846042699
The dejection was almost universal .	12761.578608362128
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper ;	6672.2563104865385
But in spite of all this fine talking , my dear Lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured , that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair .	4106.386405412047
No why should he ?	14719.220629470832
As Gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she and her children should go to London , at the same time that Bennet came from it .	3463.1211293241463
Yet , how just a humiliation !	15497.053699570208
Nay , when I read a letter of his , I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham , much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law .	6583.5502246809865
Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ?	9963.409995136846
Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and which he thought the prettiest ?	5839.820200616144
In the afternoon , the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves ;	5266.967395684608
He has children of his own , and may have more .	4341.347066065769
Family pride , and filial pride , for he is very proud of what his father was , have done this .	7923.473052347853
It was to this effect : Since writing the above , dearest Lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ;	5392.884347770286
Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield , which was fixed for the following Tuesday .	6354.8212933605255
This was his plan of amends of atonement for inheriting their father's estate ;	9077.790067771728
and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached .	5865.693300579002
If you will thank me , he replied , let it be for yourself alone .	5109.33041378545
I hope he will overlook it .	4599.384581760671
Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her .	6003.122595349191
that he should have been in love with her for so many months !	4357.892608905903
She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting .	6397.91675233514
and as she considered that Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations , and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct , she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before .	4914.109586543125
Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again ?	8470.381593304659
She was ashamed to think how much .	5204.544422326916
Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends ?	8036.747215750516
She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference .	6491.737403711025
1813 .	40535.86118978839
Do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart .	6279.68395880863
and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer !	6140.944618180424
Did you , on reading it , give any credit to its contents ?	9267.069454064542
When tea was over , Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table but in vain .	6776.495720143545
Yes , he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word .	7157.908760170367
and Elizabeth found , that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations' consent , there was still something to be wished for .	5465.760437757712
and neither the carriage , nor the livery of the servant who preceded it , were familiar to them .	6090.661693837119
Oh , well !	11710.016892665239
for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ;	7662.683954516098
Is nothing due to me on that score ?	13703.327161526222
but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter and said , Jane , I congratulate you .	3111.395773715983
Bennet's best comfort was , that Bingley must be down again in the summer .	7153.562987532726
and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , I never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them .	4936.958979320339
The park paling was still the boundary on one side , and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground .	4827.6545460176285
Jane certainly could not come back .	11274.109552803871
To the civil enquiries which then poured in , and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Bingley's , she could not make a very favourable answer .	4242.317155757831
He begged pardon for having displeased her .	7218.420462872881
But she is nothing to me now .	5603.382681976729
Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time .	6435.455637068342
Miss Darcy , on her brother's entrance , exerted herself much more to talk ;	6270.975987659598
He made no answer , and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton .	4302.352734197768
the nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people !	10980.713139630408
If , indeed , it should be so !	5726.758345671355
I cannot fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation .	5328.209261616045
He had rather hoped that all his wife's views on the stranger would be disappointed ;	7550.693947791537
CHAPTER XVI .	12871.90986889334
Her report was highly favourable .	14443.771089296006
Every body said how well she looked ;	11869.092332515442
He seemed scarcely to hear her , and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation ;	5162.553937694862
They were now almost at the door of the house , for she had walked fast to get rid of him ;	3604.669465737665
He is so excessively handsome !	8232.909257575287
for Long has just been here , and she told me all about it .	4635.087294193403
where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure ;	8628.01539384434
Darcy , after enquiring of her how and Gardiner did , a question which she could not answer without confusion , said scarcely any thing .	5425.136318750671
They gradually ascended for half a mile , and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence , where the wood ceased , and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House , situated on the opposite side of a valley , into which the road with some abruptness wound .	6315.915461012919
He was too happy , however , to need much attention ;	4313.383032482975
Why Jane you never dropt a word of this ;	10197.372035279273
It was all pride and insolence .	7068.890917849602
How does Georgiana get on , Darcy ?	9802.926566541551
At such a distance as that , you know , things are strangely misrepresented .	6732.225495197856
and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted .	7446.770951454673
We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured .	6503.996738138787
pray make haste and come into the dining-room , for there is such a sight to be seen !	6374.248236878175
When they were gone , Elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent .	5303.894818891458
My dear Eliza he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way .	4159.241965339004
Her ease and good spirits increased .	12529.473675721405
Elizabeth , who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Darcy had been , was much relieved by discerning such different feelings .	5284.598226112546
Oh , yes !	5724.659857146617
, but its volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous locations .	14415.95818141941
Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship , in spite of a great opposition of character .	6058.923889434677
said Charlotte , as soon as he was gone .	4232.828040699418
There is also one other person in the party , he continued after a pause , who more particularly wishes to be known to you , Will you allow me , or do I ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton ?	5639.480881942274
When a woman has five grown up daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty .	7511.826482755141
cried his wife impatiently .	13818.661445383288
Neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude , replied Elizabeth , have any possible claim on me , in the present instance .	6883.257458035532
and addressed herself particularly to Bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation .	5925.613900492063
His manners are very different from his cousin's .	11496.982789474834
But it is so strange !	7036.71523856479
About ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire , to which he belonged .	6474.518404498335
And pray what sort of guardians do you make ?	9302.128840139407
Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in my dressing-room .	10345.86797298693
Can you possibly guess , Lizzy , who is meant by this ?	7566.304259668877
You may depend upon my not mentioning it .	4193.693313311206
and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs .	5892.360510435258
and to prevent its ever happening again , took care to inform him at first , that it was a favourite haunt of hers .	5051.4918948888
certainly , cried his faithful assistant , no one can be really esteemed accomplished , who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with .	7807.769962179472
He was writing , and , without raising his head , coolly replied , Just as you please .	5575.294776083878
March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford .	14659.74729029576
Bennet was perfectly satisfied ;	10865.832204858916
When the gentlemen rose to go away , Bennet was mindful of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time .	4797.773835776691
that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking Darcy's character , though he had assured her that respect for the father , would always prevent his exposing the son .	6498.956139982239
His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost .	9795.918616320128
I have not the smallest hope .	3929.862402217984
She coloured as she spoke ;	11135.339991195613
She opened the door , and met Maria in the landing place , who , breathless with agitation , cried out , Oh , my dear Eliza !	5189.271979705142
There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed .	7882.583200197555
You shall hear what she says .	7849.834836019711
I do not see what right Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend's inclination , or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy .	4847.384667186899
A few weeks , he believed .	11727.025283559866
But think no more of the letter .	5094.8641780062735
When is your next ball to be , Lizzy ?	8960.172264211056
You see how continually we are engaged there .	8211.025594921464
Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours ;	18750.08379870174
You know I always speak my mind , and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves .	4978.186665896685
See paragraph 1 .	12614.241452532937
I am happier even than Jane ;	5526.886304553767
but it must be done soon .	4955.307324602114
they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence ;	12324.784944338475
if it must be so , it must .	8456.528295277078
I should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match , cried Elizabeth .	3566.9871011576024
She followed her father to the fire place , and they both sat down .	6088.58869675937
We have judged it best , that my niece should be married from this house , of which I hope you will approve .	5757.952869896183
and , after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable composure .	4213.0865679220005
Yes , she will remain there till Christmas .	7045.1920999748345
Special rules , set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license , apply to copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark .	6600.889921682267
and Gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing , by the servant's account , that their niece was taken suddenly ill ;	6760.530540290034
Remember , Eliza , that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do .	5628.240136433448
but I think I shall like your husband quite as well as Jane's .	5393.61203906201
I do not think we were speaking at all .	2650.5542399641067
Well , cried her mother , it is all very right ;	3890.369529223038
and Hurst , principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings , joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss Bennet .	6523.474653922667
Yet he is such a man !	8195.8222245168
You have delighted us long enough .	6699.43701185677
Bennet could hardly contain herself .	9371.745140335845
Be that as it may , she saw him go with regret ;	9601.349115379131
She had even learnt to detect , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary .	6420.323450649177
dear me !	27218.438195463354
when it was no longer likely they should meet .	9291.700775494624
but with the rich , he is liberal-minded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and perhaps agreeable , allowing something for fortune and figure .	6596.431187963186
and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him .	5056.425725320783
You blamed me for coming ?	12225.600236865102
Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield ;	10012.811676995767
and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look .	6407.093382726571
Have you any idea , Lizzy , who this gentleman is ?	8353.058771195696
It was not in her nature , however , to increase her vexations , by dwelling on them .	3062.7219277663808
and even Darcy acknowledged , that the partridges were remarkably well done ;	6354.442024789099
There is something very pompous in his style .	8942.184915108293
You certainly do , she replied with a smile ;	7909.642708140049
and though Collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as I have often told her , to come to Rosings every day , and play on the piano-forte in Jenkinson's room .	4415.668137995645
Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to conciliate her .	6149.57701726403
and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet .	3652.5634125064894
They contained no actual complaint , nor was there any revival of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering .	7733.03279735807
Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage ;	7327.889303364201
Kitty was the only one who shed tears ;	10935.903362557736
And then you have added so much to it yourself , you are always buying books .	7040.0605086931255
This cannot be !	11387.737302913372
and Elizabeth , who knew what curiosities his letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise .	4768.294761281011
When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer , I made a point of her having two men servants go with her .	6076.442532670056
Elizabeth , on her side , had much to do .	4236.016668468605
The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a headache ;	9217.471089174236
Indeed , Jane , you ought to believe me .	5638.267582459867
And so would Anne , if her health had allowed her to apply .	7743.944613918543
I will read it to you When my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to London , might be concluded in three or four days , but as we are certain it cannot be so , and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town , he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel .	4701.648792337438
They entered it in one of its lowest points , and drove for some time through a beautiful wood , stretching over a wide extent .	7061.306993349399
May we take my uncle's letter to read to her ?	12509.263730745512
When the card tables were placed , he had an opportunity of obliging her in return , by sitting down to whist .	6163.532403150524
After a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display .	5471.274490990711
but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands .	5335.538092095012
he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and that , if he marry prudently , his wife may teach him .	5964.094126469587
and Bennet , for many years after Lydia's birth , had been certain that he would .	5598.628584328463
and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements , new carriages and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield , in the course of three or four months .	5259.413297063016
hatred had vanished long ago , and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him , that could be so called .	6852.304502990373
But I will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well .	3915.56382318881
If his own vanity , however , did not mislead him , he was the cause , his pride and caprice were the cause of all that Jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer .	4671.835935573855
I fancy , Lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all .	5059.1481680571715
Their affectionate mother shared all their grief ;	13843.342183042889
a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room .	4812.591500251522
Pray , how violent was Bingley's love ?	12341.828041175786
but Lady Catherine very resolutely , and not very politely , declined eating any thing ;	7341.929405811271
Now what have you to say ?	11441.61363588017
and in front , a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater , but without any artificial appearance .	6820.222991245498
He carved , and ate , and praised with delighted alacrity ;	10375.619380121669
E5 .	61437.34662756191
But though every thing seemed neat and comfortable , she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance ;	6404.099096765788
When I am in the country , he replied , I never wish to leave it ;	3485.5527669245985
It only shews her being deficient in something herself sense or feeling .	9192.489334207772
Yes , very well .	5143.40175438645
and , though she was not very sanguine in expecting it , the application was a something to look forward to .	4456.82324080227
Is this a hint to me , Lizzy , said her father , to send for the horses ?	4452.489654329092
and more than commonly anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her .	6193.364862870854
However , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts , and I am very glad to hear what you tell us , of long sleeves .	5168.339318800359
you know he is , as well as I do ;	5760.380978742267
Pray forgive me , if I have been very presuming , or at least do not punish me so far , as to exclude me from P I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park .	5111.3770933531705
Your idea of the ponies is delightful .	11591.282782466795
then recollecting himself , I will not detain you a minute , but let me , or let the servant , go after and Gardiner .	7126.290745343296
In the first place , he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron .	5802.4525458881835
but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you .	4265.509222661399
Bennet could not have chosen better .	6683.498270560717
and know them to be so much attached to me !	5831.912810185369
Her sister made not the smallest objection , and the piano-forte was opened , and Darcy , after a few moments recollection , was not sorry for it .	3488.855142999353
Elizabeth was surprised , but said not a word .	3864.067840141985
CHAPTER X More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park , unexpectedly meet Darcy .	7717.708788518764
They have none of them much to recommend them , replied he ;	7061.823013631842
After walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on resuming their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant , there chanced to be a little alteration .	5828.346706099858
and Collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much .	7221.91919927943
and yet it should seem by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy .	4256.886235749381
I dare say you believed it ;	4101.895898360412
You are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on ;	6871.282327553383
nothing , therefore , could be fairly conjectured from that , though Elizabeth , who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings , was perfectly aware , that , had she known nothing of Darcy , she could have borne the dread of Lydia's infamy somewhat better .	4628.667535850299
her voice was weak , and her manner affected .	9571.908204065398
Would you believe it , Lizzy , that when he went to town last November , he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent , would have prevented his coming down again !	5550.1757105490915
he kissed it with affectionate gallantry , though he hardly knew how to look , and they entered the house .	5244.037715569374
The particulars , I reserve till we meet .	11017.06933842452
and she looked on the whole scene , the river , the trees scattered on its banks , and the winding of the valley , as far as she could trace it , with delight .	4874.666727092621
It was an animating subject , and Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match .	5639.536461674218
Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ;	6264.370765576781
Neither could any thing be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities which Darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach .	7070.976317536141
She then sought her eldest sister , who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley .	4969.184637491394
From Collins !	21992.827751727884
Will you do me the honour of reading that letter ?	9245.220823036938
So , Lizzy , said he one day , your sister is crossed in love I find .	5757.561909115003
Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately ;	5889.732888425927
There was no want of discourse .	7297.765516507396
His coming into the country at all , is a most insolent thing indeed , and I wonder how he could presume to do it .	3967.731203641705
So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him !	8536.945357425668
and he was obliged to walk about the room , while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences .	4787.604047258799
How well it sounds .	16292.388291526366
It should not be said , that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers .	4518.869318286693
and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself ;	5149.805078462328
They found Bennet still up .	10600.386879580872
and they conversed with so much spirit and flow , as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself , as well as of Darcy .	3797.3598437408205
But it is , returned she ;	5584.538406858299
He shook his head .	8107.420524876036
His daughter's request , for such it might be considered , of being admitted into her family again , before she set off for the North , received at first an absolute negative .	7113.494120060847
Stop me whilst you can .	18076.807994315837
Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure , and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming , when she found herself so affectionately received .	5988.213043741325
Is it possible !	18978.434223264652
Let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ;	6013.579183853714
He delighted in going to Pemberley , especially when he was least expected .	7076.783609854287
I had no notion but he would go a shooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company .	4970.2380837379305
Elizabeth was in agonies .	9224.854755455483
Your uncle is as much surprised as I am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned , would have allowed him to act as he has done .	6043.996630988738
This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted : and Elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away .	5539.479805349119
Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to his wife ?	10018.34027026276
On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects .	7803.469509825245
An express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from Colonel Forster , to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers ;	6209.472229918417
This has been my motive , my fair cousin , and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem .	5204.776312680583
You ought certainly to forgive them as a christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing .	7647.506159188197
I will not encourage the impudence of either , by receiving them at Longbourn .	4670.054580086242
The next morning , however , made an alteration ;	5102.252052556767
Charlotte is an excellent manager , I dare say .	6881.06785996176
It is evident by this , added Jane , that he comes back no more this winter .	4383.422482041025
To be sure that did seem as if he admired her indeed I rather believe he did I heard something about it but I hardly know what something about Robinson .	6325.13356319952
With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ;	8262.184892537693
When she remembered the style of his address , she was still full of indignation ;	6993.643633640391
When first Bennet had married , economy was held to be perfectly useless ;	9665.736484694837
The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came , and Bennet was forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle , was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth .	4994.417257511316
can it be really so !	19130.970693447664
She had never seen a place for which nature had done more , or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste .	5958.238343986873
I hope , added Gardiner , that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her .	4890.803063807018
what can have induced him to behave so cruelly ?	13489.038317362018
Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications .	8098.342799946952
His eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity ;	8099.9589796095825
As soon as all had ate , and the elder ones paid , the carriage was ordered ;	6069.599417230878
You know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself .	4772.363237457361
Let me hear what it is .	7377.481670609109
He meant , I believe , replied Jane , to go to Epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the postilions , and try if any thing could be made out from them .	5017.161409756038
observed Bennet .	28253.143742761084
and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible .	3485.3533004966525
The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic .	8390.130895398785
My overhearings were more to the purpose than yours , Eliza , said Charlotte .	8022.444170658647
his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had .	6572.891272359531
said Elizabeth .	8045.34531137579
The first mentioned was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , I had detached Bingley from your sister , and the other , that I had , in defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , ruined the immediate prosperity , and blasted the prospects of Wickham .	4423.698483691836
Darcy is all politeness , said Elizabeth , smiling .	5509.287805206672
said Jane .	10530.671620167666
It was some days , however , before they received any invitation thither , for while there were visitors in the house , they could not be necessary ;	3707.1449518762242
Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth and it was soon done done while Bennet was stirring the fire .	7374.536296072843
I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings , and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three , of whom we shall deprive you .	5937.07576106507
It taught me to hope , said he , as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before .	4197.887268046631
but since then , we have both , I hope , improved in civility .	5407.265150591741
but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him .	3999.0555867039016
When Jane and Elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in her praise of Bingley before , expressed to her sister how very much she admired him .	5201.465826366063
There can be no love in all this .	5986.784888973535
Yet it is hard , she sometimes thought , that this poor man cannot come to a house , which he has legally hired , without raising all this speculation !	7702.773943377669
and Bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice .	6913.0062095194835
Good heavens !	29123.45461863632
If I had been able , said she , to carry my point of going to Brighton , with all my family , this would not have happened ;	3828.2164550629454
Indeed I had .	14486.344419743515
and in the mean time , she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married , to Hill and the two housemaids .	5394.820886849572
Lydia's being settled in the North , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment ;	5941.374829612918
The younger ones out before the elder are married !	7976.254633730204
My excellent father died about five years ago ;	11826.579267114326
We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening , said Elizabeth .	5694.484465558662
And if you will stay another month complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London , for I am going there early in June , for a week ;	4190.210946897901
Lizzy , you must not do so .	5076.78650216341
Only look at her .	9393.346779009646
and the Hursts have no horses to theirs .	7645.071336048255
She directly replied , You need not be frightened .	8665.99143436091
How nicely we are crammed in !	12827.918891639252
The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning's impatience .	9222.13118932152

Lizzy , when you first read that letter , I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now .	4369.7784354135765
but her's she thought was still worse .	10255.844182816125
and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty .	7675.634665465467
But does Lydia know nothing of this ?	8429.843843247341
She counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent ;	9520.747998541303
Can such abominable pride as his , have ever done him good ?	11775.611792355501
Oh !	5043.244884590713
Good Heaven !	14982.467771560046
Have all her friends left her ?	13197.800905400723
Their brother , indeed , was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency .	5561.463190135724
The colour which had been driven from her face , returned for half a minute with an additional glow , and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes , as she thought for that space of time , that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken .	5368.45889169799
Pardon me .	15310.046887911249
My dear , dear Lizzy , I would I do congratulate you but are you certain ?	4537.421661846323
Her father had been an attorney in Meryton , and had left her four thousand pounds .	5056.419300655073
She had fully proposed being engaged by Wickham for those very dances : and to have Collins instead !	7343.97887043844
I am so grieved for him .	2902.3858058855526
She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together .	4973.624259844688
no , I certainly am not .	9679.604525361869
You quite mistook Darcy .	9777.841166319467
but this is the true one .	7511.152136017947
Yes , in conjunction with his friend .	5267.956595319056
and still different from either , was what Bennet sent to Collins , in reply to his last .	6009.3326517335945
Bingley was every thing that was charming , except the professed lover of her daughter .	6165.306574565831
They repulsed every attempt of Bennet at conversation , and by so doing , threw a languor over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Collins , who was complimenting Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests .	5121.9242769573175
As all conversation was thereby at an end , Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room .	6327.152907913177
Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject ;	8127.467014059539
When first he came in , he had spoken to her but little ;	7098.460876731775
If it is designedly done , they cannot be justified ;	9726.46727827578
But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both .	6119.538287305166
and , as they drew near the appointed inn where Bennet's carriage was to meet them , they quickly perceived , in token of the coachman's punctuality , both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs .	5263.823999044504
What , none of you ?	9792.341756433187
Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman , and required information ;	9076.10279204267
Well , my comfort is , I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done .	3653.490346911383
Too much , I am afraid ;	9154.631107470996
This was very amiable , but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any conception of ;	7879.038699079764
His family knew him to be on all common occasions , a most negligent and dilatory correspondent , but at such a time , they had hoped for exertion .	6070.872352660824
His first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance , as far as it would go .	4445.716066829682
She wanted to talk , but there seemed an embargo on every subject .	6080.563560918042
In every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived .	7761.917253886773
but on perceiving Darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner .	7245.612855358269
She was more alive to the disgrace , which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham , a fortnight before they took place .	5574.891309107805
and Gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in London the very next day , and would assist Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia .	3873.5094285306036
And then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you ;	6362.350285173662
As for Elizabeth , her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last ;	7383.103052784446
They are not married , nor can I find there was any intention of being so ;	6404.455704656838
for you are really proud of your defects in writing , because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution , which if not estimable , you think at least highly interesting .	7266.645198332844
You never will be able to make both of them good for any thing .	4763.780433749929
They walked towards the Lucases , because Kitty wished to call upon Maria ;	8021.605195583759
But you see that Jane , said her aunt , does not think so ill of Wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt .	3817.7738736806878
I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ;	5534.869514062222
it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it .	4950.4209862463995
The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend , assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London , might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment .	5338.02772403726
She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either , or make either appear to advantage .	7204.870381054797
You allude perhaps to the entail of this estate .	8787.709630943102
She could not win him , however , to any conversation ;	4274.96516114484
by her ease and liveliness , his mind might have been softened , his manners improved , and from his judgment , information , and knowledge of the world , she must have received benefit of greater importance .	6259.494266388308
Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone .	8381.995667897429
I enquired after their brother , of course .	6461.3090729044125
Bennet could hardly comprehend it .	8187.588896854351
and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both .	5405.750293232631
Dear me !	25944.80864269491
by reason , by reflection , by every thing .	10667.569276899067
to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed , and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation , console herself for the present , and prepare for another disappointment .	6092.49924599149
During dinner , Bennet scarcely spoke at all ;	12507.015063341702
To convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself , was no very difficult point .	4993.745464156365
my daughters are brought up differently .	14935.398572511296
and after listening a moment , she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry , and calling loudly after her .	5484.147685396355
Why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent , said she , did he come at all ?	5301.285783807641
I do think it is the hardest thing in the world , that your estate should be entailed away from your own children ;	4059.7409565846015
Bennet treasured up the hint , and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married ;	7147.6302959494415
Do you know Bingley ?	10757.702457453268
Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy .	8709.824102444853
and very unwillingly said so .	8096.154238227397
Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter ;	8329.498482895506
Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not .	4675.027901457123
He had been some time with Gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river , and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning .	4532.740734417932
He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies , of whose beauty he had heard much ;	5146.64443710651
Good God !	25946.669485322753
Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever .	4749.595995466827
Something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them , but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life .	5524.072547036644
it came from Netherfield , and was opened immediately .	5699.93251997748
They have each their advantages , and I can be equally happy in either .	6251.578822687795
She was wild to be at home to hear , to see , to be upon the spot , to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her , in a family so deranged ;	5236.846137712674
In making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self-reproach .	5585.452596003958
CHAPTER I Elizabeth , as they drove along , watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation ;	6803.564955430638
Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance ;	8004.837689198695
And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton , of whom I shall subjoin a list , according to his information .	6030.282751612816
But make a virtue of it by all means .	8187.858017299414
Arguments are too much like disputes .	19307.089765605262
I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , Lizzy ?	5447.405800814796
The rest of the evening passed with the appearance , on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no farther attempt to distinguish Elizabeth ;	4965.010130859366
I believe , Ma'am , I may safely promise you never to dance with him .	3601.710698915643
No , no .	7381.2980372796155
and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least .	5323.860619862051
At length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself .	3860.917376483686
She followed him with her eyes , envied every one to whom he spoke , had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee ;	6885.153492359628
I never saw such a long chin in my life .	4083.7095157427625
I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield .	3414.849795212913
cried Elizabeth ;	8515.023495238232
but this was all lost upon me .	6020.216463085016
No , Kitty , I have at last learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it .	4186.883515733708
The principal purport of his letter was to inform them , that Wickham had resolved on quitting the Militia .	6065.168137042672
I shall be very fit to see Jane which is all I want .	5929.536547111322
When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford , every eye was in search of the Parsonage , and every turning expected to bring it in view .	6304.94515364985
her complexion has no brilliancy ;	18806.38826167412
said her mother as soon as she was in the hall .	4554.061454080101
They will join me early to-morrow , he continued , and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you , Bingley and his sisters .	5602.262232906642
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity .	6366.19926944659
I do not mind his not talking to Long , said Miss Lucas , but I wish he had danced with Eliza .	4178.233629614525
but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder .	5128.180335218045
Yes , there can ;	8386.978283379472
If you received the work electronically , the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund .	5329.451286577279
Make haste , make haste .	16401.217779969156
My reasons for believing it are briefly these : It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance , or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable .	6685.923821296647
After amusing himself some time with their curiosity , he thus explained .	10357.119347526603
I had not believed it possible .	5296.2831665301
Forgive me ;	23116.407932930255
This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself .	6706.190821228678
Darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say something indistinctly of his concern , and observe her in compassionate silence .	6739.722163335801
At length there was nothing more to be said ;	7452.056059102209
Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ;	9981.529456404363
She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room .	4813.133181668268
But at least it shews , that she was serious in the object of her journey .	4487.438454803715
but , exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone .	7739.31676515917
Elizabeth quietly answered Undoubtedly ;	14311.058557446562
Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic ;	13565.69798325306
You must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course .	4248.174242960539
I can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ;	6542.674752689209
Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming .	10380.651482739037
I dare say she will ;	5393.670957378694
But self , though it would intrude , could not engross her .	5525.018023905619
His temptation is not adequate to the risk .	11531.736901610979
a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point , without being resented .	8881.111295388093
Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal from the shire , as clearly as Gardiner could do .	6360.606197022307
To Bennet's acknowledgments he briefly replied , with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family ;	6819.830319412082
When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned , in terms of such mortifying , yet merited reproach , her sense of shame was severe .	5720.125815750334
He is now gone into the army , she added , but I am afraid he has turned out very wild .	3535.4748024242112
and , after giving each of them an hasty kiss , hurried into the vestibule , where Jane , who came running down stairs from her mother's apartment , immediately met her .	5083.3411187498905
Take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one .	7290.610045047816
I am most seriously displeased .	6440.733311280935
When they ascended the steps to the hall , Maria's alarm was every moment increasing , and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm .	6635.050667407883
My feelings will not be repressed .	9002.638044544878
Nor was Darcy's vindication , though grateful to her feelings , capable of consoling her for such discovery .	7847.518537492842
All that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds , secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ;	6635.340444862208
My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other .	6999.423894587233
She has known him only a fortnight .	7117.65624723047
I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being .	6266.120614429794
and Elizabeth , as they waited for the housekeeper , had leisure to wonder at her being where she was .	3910.797689972329
Elizabeth , though expecting no less , thanked him with tears of gratitude ;	7469.504000589727
I am sick of them all .	3305.919193193384
You shall not , for the sake of one individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that selfishness is prudence , and insensibility of danger , security for happiness .	5491.186685177145
Elizabeth now began to revive .	12235.235631991023
She received him with her very best politeness , which he returned with as much more , apologising for his intrusion , without any previous acquaintance with her , which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice .	4837.075317276943
Very nonsensical to come at all !	14471.058080306346
Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to identify , do copyright research on , transcribe and proofread public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm collection .	8404.795687347896
From that moment I observed my friend's behaviour attentively ;	12883.367799497835
One enjoyment was certain that of suitableness as companions ;	12140.261849651057
And if I am that choice , why may not I accept him ?	7410.169986148554
D The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you can do with this work .	7664.474470724607
Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival , that Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine ;	4795.603680235724
Elizabeth smiled .	13499.685478882875
Such doings discomposed Bennet exceedingly .	14927.591199945904
My sister , who is more than ten years my junior , was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew , Colonel Fitzwilliam , and myself .	5436.988594985573
It suddenly struck her that it might be from lady Catherine ;	7677.891327370736
E8 .	35290.54376147641
Let Wickham be your man .	12419.086979764792
She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it .	5550.923077435908
At last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance of Darcy , with such a smile over the face , as she remembered to have sometimes seen , when he looked at her .	4551.833351607925
and whenever they changed their quarters , either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to , for some little assistance towards discharging their bills .	7123.875098134389
But I must write no more .	5021.452121642648
and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation .	7836.853428088832
Write to me very often , my dear .	9747.642664704954
She could see him instantly before her , in every charm of air and address ;	6943.562037120454
But , really , I know not what to say .	4055.7729538161984
and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it , to Ramsgate ;	7617.43057130866
His plan did not vary on seeing them .	7707.088291472563
Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ?	9299.100213128173
just enough to make one good sort of man ;	10125.396972023022
and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been ;	6906.3423442295625
Poor Jane !	22667.588939362424
The more I see of the world , the more am I dissatisfied with it ;	5456.407634206713
He and his sisters were well , I hope , when you left London .	5147.230183419328
International donations are gratefully accepted , but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States .	7916.551966150041
CHAPTER III .	14734.305895909685
Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect , that the sight of such rooms , so many servants , and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them .	5369.990069533893
Don't keep coughing so , Kitty , for heaven's sake !	12254.392516454778
Under such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief .	5417.917201994715
and at that moment she felt , that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something !	6127.455980538449
Lord , how ashamed I should be of not being married before three and twenty !	8077.368502193285
She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure .	7246.909963988636
nor could she for many hours , learn to think of it less than incessantly .	7252.424495153459
You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness ;	7919.458362254271
His consenting to marry her is a proof , I will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking .	5045.282125884965
To-morrow fortnight .	32686.063503604673
but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other , of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that Denny had brought him from London , and that he was to have a lieutenant's commission in the shire .	3981.6484217649763
It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way .	4254.97234349721
My youngest of all , is lately married , and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds , walking with a young man , who I believe will soon become a part of the family .	4509.1659271356
They were then , with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance , taken into the house ;	6217.165484155244
But Elizabeth , who had not the least inclination to remain with them , laughingly answered , No , no ;	5322.380338047693
and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement .	5808.290638604212
All field sports were over .	13922.09989138065
My style of writing is very different from yours .	10437.56737349775
c .	28335.691008049325
and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror , Gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power .	6440.275007346311
Thus , we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition .	10301.089971616619
She wrote even to Jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her former professions of regard .	5864.338392103377
CHAPTER X The day passed much as the day before had done .	7371.365857924497
He merely added , that he should not write again , till he had something of importance to mention .	4691.728031985295
It originated in Gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support , and consequently preferred her husband's .	6121.7098308612785
After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with It is your turn to say something now , Darcy .	6294.988441184689
and his commendation of every thing would have touched Bennet's heart , but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property .	6478.7493105444655
She comes to us to-day .	11122.980556449156
I will not tell you what it is .	4363.058133398328
At length however Bennet had no more to say ;	6417.751517315395
The power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor , and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance .	7077.358214020435
Then turning to Bennet , he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon .	9718.240210129103
The subjection in which his father had brought him up , had given him originally great humility of manner , but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head , living in retirement , and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity .	5261.730738132573
From the entrance hall , of which Collins pointed out , with a rapturous air , the fine proportion and finished ornaments , they followed the servants through an anti-chamber , to the room where Lady Catherine , her daughter , and Jenkinson were sitting .	5834.183566854281
and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over .	4350.36363405683
Now , said she , that this first meeting is over , I feel perfectly easy .	4895.5318972259665
The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited .	6497.124646281045
After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight , and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear ;	7321.904551457572
What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy ?	8756.651846922927
Lydia was exceedingly fond of him .	6632.265886676596
When coffee was over , Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him ;	6660.364907162805
I do not believe she often sees such at home .	3614.369371062632
A clergyman like you must marry .	9967.440280448149
But gracious me !	11748.851681982203
It was agreed to .	5853.12176729529
But she would not be secure .	5737.759006220637
Though I shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ;	9871.166627221553
You are so strange !	8691.205534763187
Having resolved to do it without loss of time , as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday , and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment , he set about it in a very orderly manner , with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business .	5671.36479863519
E GARDINER .	31707.01493722203
For my own part , she rejoined , I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her .	5994.2673989318155
and in the evening Bennet's invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter .	5011.514889872002
Yes , always , she replied , without knowing what she said , for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , I remember hearing you once say , Darcy , that you hardly ever forgave , that your resentment once created was unappeasable .	4734.013724438342
my sweetest Lizzy !	17319.29203937643
And I think you will agree with me , in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece's .	6733.186331944011
Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations ;	10773.076162823712
CHAPTER XVIII .	12871.90986889334
F6 .	61437.34662756191
that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her , and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening .	4533.187722323149
CHAPTER III .	14734.305895909685
What a charming amusement for young people this is , Darcy !	7139.848232098869
I remember , as soon as ever I saw him , when he first came into Hertfordshire last year , I thought how likely it was that you should come together .	4335.8691986335425
But it is all , all too late now .	5402.107294452355
and Bennet found , with amazement and horror , that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter .	6237.217429542412
She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse , but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other , and how formal and cold was their manner , whenever they did .	4284.246383492295
No one who has ever seen you together , can doubt his affection .	8687.486529919892
Elizabeth listened as little as she could , but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name .	5210.860503122018
that it should be equally unreserved was impossible .	7883.89202624884
It is because he will not give himself the trouble .	7102.040858654379
Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself , and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam , Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word I say .	5262.403940127395
He is perfectly well behaved , polite , and unassuming , said her uncle .	6009.840231599894
You have reduced him to his present state of poverty , comparative poverty .	8253.52587923308
Nearly three weeks .	21500.653175320454
Oh !	5043.244884590713
His appearance was greatly in his favour ;	9765.34561741812
I have sent for you on an affair of importance .	6319.405124173097
When to these recollections was added the developement of Wickham's character , it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before , were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful .	6522.3631951252
but Ashworth is too far off !	11098.892592460497
She now lost every expectation of pleasure .	8773.719757567582
Miss Bennet , replied her ladyship , in an angry tone , you ought to know , that I am not to be trifled with .	3110.1536330266877
for I consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman .	7582.582583994612
On reaching the spacious lobby above , they were shewn into a very pretty sitting-room , lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below ;	7578.280408605871
You know pretty well , I suppose , what has been done for the young people .	4645.960561687388
At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted .	9671.304248140748
I never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong .	6871.706015423912
Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible .	10027.191433910992
Elizabeth silently attended her .	8146.105576918519
Oh , Jane , take care .	7093.099049061675
Oh !	5043.244884590713
' But afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time .	6687.3138952043755
She examined into their employments , looked at their work , and advised them to do it differently ;	7993.164836287403
CHAPTER XI .	12871.90986889334
unless you looked up to him as a superior .	13011.08343479205
I have therefore made up my mind to tell you , that I do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare .	4580.475550701357
and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William , in which she was readily joined by Jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of Collins , and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London .	4511.6475049797455
Who do you mean , my dear ?	7186.220968072568
Though Bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage .	4147.544164937216
how can it affect them ?	13937.133863084198
They had nothing to accuse him of but pride ;	6965.103427868877
He was coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland : when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey .	5457.311777769707
Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game , except when Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh's being too hot or too cold , or having too much or too little light .	7975.542677046266
but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future .	5740.6220623686

He scarcely ever spoke to her , and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself , were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas , whose civility in listening to him , was a seasonable relief to them all , and especially to her friend .	3336.667927028334
CHAPTER VIII .	12871.90986889334
When at length they arose to take leave , Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn ;	6237.752007868477
I could see him with perfect indifference , but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of .	4423.646126100348
I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes .	7298.957143578947
and the two , who were most anxiously expected , to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen , were in very good time .	4815.409797381545
No one but Bennet , regretted that their stay would be so short ;	8778.622630312451
Lydia has no brothers to step forward ;	13840.638674964324
CHAPTER XII .	12871.90986889334
Well , mamma , said she , when they were all returned to the breakfast room , and what do you think of my husband ?	3030.5502400696982
'Tis as good as a Lord !	15783.547360286722
forgive the question are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ?	9491.042205160242
and therefore gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent , his actions were capable of a very different construction ;	4814.245284025361
But what is that to me ?	7183.7444457571
a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade .	9600.428834310136
To fortune I am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since I am well aware that it could not be complied with ;	5885.034313106784
Girls , can I do any thing for you in Meryton ?	11570.678737574606
[ Illustration : Morning Dress .	15676.71183161859
But the wife of Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation , that she could , upon the whole , have no cause to repine .	5052.171698694546
Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table , and they went up stairs together .	5142.214208196105
Your alliance will be a disgrace ;	11797.247172179055
I have every reason in the world to think ill of you .	3427.1265350270405
Elizabeth immediately recognising the livery , guessed what it meant , and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations , by acquainting them with the honour which she expected .	7285.950743773919
At present , indeed , they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood ;	6082.369751109938
The world has been deceived in that respect ;	9778.610427329324
Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility ;	7725.967044601921
He must write his own sermons ;	10615.699880102335
which will not be yours till after your mother's decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to .	7827.799207205274
She stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation , and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery .	8212.561482356767
Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ?	8436.609525780628
Miss Darcy's praise occupied the chief of it .	4977.339855849618
Recovering himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said , Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of .	5976.779154105192
Is her husband , is the son of his late father's steward , to be his brother ?	6113.9291469186965
Lady Catherine approached , and , after listening for a few minutes , said to Darcy , Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss , if she practised more , and could have the advantage of a London master .	3942.404919601133
but Sir William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane , who were dancing together .	5072.563007985453
How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell , but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you .	5813.0909144377265
Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother .	10005.235394952302
Certainly , replied Elizabeth there are such people , but I hope I am not one of them .	3622.8880185011567
See paragraph 1 .	12614.241452532937
I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did .	5248.916286816666
Had his own happiness , however , been the only sacrifice , he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best ;	5720.222417907705
And with a bow to Darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room .	4628.891757043991
She would not betray her trust , I suppose , without bribery and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be found .	4947.363552920876
but they were now necessary , and she assured him with some confusion , of her attachment to Darcy .	5247.938378485764
All was acknowledged , and half the night spent in conversation .	9847.000665517315
If we are ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been , said Elizabeth , and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what Gardiner has done for them , because Wickham has not sixpence of his own .	5174.863836307313
Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father .	12563.494000942115
Hunsford , near Westerham , Kent , 15th October .	16088.018668319577
Bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from London , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time .	4917.053084236009
and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life .	5397.628082487706
I would keep a pack of foxhounds , and drink a bottle of wine every day .	6211.770899489451
Now , seriously , what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence ?	9633.968260754775
and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to elope with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ;	5154.096055629017
Must it be so ?	19916.684677684505
These bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had I with greater policy concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified , unalloyed inclination ;	7517.046267836897
I hope she will turn out well .	5841.06163741476
Teaze him laugh at him .	13112.280695859929
She danced four dances with him at Meryton ;	8452.913442762467
While the contents of the first letter remained on her mind , she was all surprise all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl , whom it was impossible he could marry for money ;	5956.499405053814
Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start , and before he could recover himself enough to speak , she , in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's situation , hastily exclaimed , I beg your pardon , but I must leave you .	5406.538928570092
I know not , Miss Elizabeth , said he , whether Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us , but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it .	3485.714769350946
And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection .	6416.103102075972
Any place would do , of about three or four hundred a year ;	10709.21528771673
The note was immediately dispatched , and its contents as quickly complied with .	7978.425684083816
and when it closed , Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon Charlotte's degree of contentment , to understand her address in guiding , and composure in bearing with her husband , and to acknowledge that it was all done very well .	5061.069215043553
But no letter appeared , and she was completely puzzled .	5534.599027387994
This was a lucky idea of mine , indeed !	6942.599010313127
but it is not sound .	5505.679972823384
What is his name ?	11873.494266997519
Reynolds , either from pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister .	6567.825814229282
Her look and manners were open , cheerful and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and I remained convinced from the evening's scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment .	5791.848665020981
Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer , and forced his younger sister to be civil also , and say what the occasion required .	6842.054597330524
Every thing that is charming !	13039.249095546633
and after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do , which was the more probable from the time of year .	5138.430951802121
Brother-in-law of Wickham !	27061.87626125048
Happy shall I be , when his stay at Netherfield is over !	13184.716848378044
Miss Darcy was tall , and on a larger scale than Elizabeth ;	6885.754182694546
At present we have nothing to guide us .	7639.08623302857
The account of his connection with the Pemberley family , was exactly what he had related himself ;	5872.058456515395
Your sisters are engaged , and there is not another woman in the room , whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with .	4645.197766756299
When I wrote that letter , replied Darcy , I believed myself perfectly calm and cool , but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit .	5052.67599383651
The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth , as the first .	5790.507184584913
We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Wickham with money .	7574.4656894072095
As soon as they had driven from the door , Elizabeth was called on by her cousin , to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings , which , for Charlotte's sake , she made more favourable than it really was .	3672.6119355638434
They may wish many things besides his happiness ;	9543.120066980175
I must conclude , for I cannot be long from my poor mother .	5347.874225656696
cried Elizabeth , brightening up for a moment .	5143.829173325112
But however he did not .	5464.744740886471
Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Hurst or Miss Bingley ;	7646.133001543845
Your friend performs delightfully ;	17420.134593064595
and the valley , here contracted into a glen , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it .	5334.115883478043
They could talk of nothing but officers ;	9223.694573793713
Their conduct has been such , replied Elizabeth , as neither you , nor I , nor any body , can ever forget .	6467.24005869439
She had obtained private intelligence that Darcy did not wish for cards ;	7494.2801310170225
why is not every body as happy ?	15526.119122019547
nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable .	9167.07119201574
He had never before supposed that , could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter , it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself , as by the present arrangement .	4713.813090161139
Kitty stared at him , and Lydia exclaimed .	9540.155826177514
Elizabeth could not help saying , It is very much to his credit , I am sure , that you should think so .	2597.4282174062964
On their being joined by Bingley himself , Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas ;	9527.022027735797
Wickham passed all his youth there , you know .	7537.156255304394
As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , I shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females .	6036.395990192264
Very little was said by either ;	14046.603890627937
repeated Elizabeth , in utter amazement .	15732.03047370414
her liveliness had been never worse timed .	15733.404785715427
Perhaps it will be as well , if you discourage his coming here so very often .	6461.666089837793
CHAPTER V Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate .	8544.428298969297
She retreated from the window , fearful of being seen ;	9227.22078127887
he sustained it however with fortitude , and so far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into conversation with Gardiner .	5570.785531137383
She shared in their attendance on Bennet , and was a great comfort to them , in their hours of freedom .	5173.716972040867
Does he know his real character ?	14304.232036877418
In her kind schemes for Elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam .	8218.120960148075
We shall often meet , I hope , in Hertfordshire .	5558.908381136388
replied Kitty , it looks just like that man that used to be with him before .	9161.356127882342
If you were to give me forty such men , I never could be so happy as you .	4810.156518308889
She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious , made no other reply to Elizabeth's salutation , than a slight inclination of the head , and sat down without saying a word .	5112.702301047128
He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever , on the occasion .	5843.920424824433
What is to become of us !	9294.539097608733
It was kindly meant .	7463.306526504758
Lydia declared herself satisfied .	15970.05208070021
My sister , I am sure , will not hear of her removal .	4177.50597640766
The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities , though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings ;	6839.177690523792
If it was not for the entail I should not mind it .	3886.9731633890465
And then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it .	3400.361036553472
They have some of the finest woods in the country .	5121.052392774932
Oh !	5043.244884590713
What did you say of me , that I did not deserve ?	5056.171761619089
You forget that I have made no answer .	4355.7847547577685
Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility .	8782.909964235052
Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied , Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully .	6418.800449275783
I know not what to think .	3788.0653161382743
Bennet could not give her consent , or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , though she talked to Bingley of nothing else , for half an hour ;	5790.7810347467
She knew not what to think , nor how to account for it .	4115.556932790714
So much the better .	7156.920982532779
You wanted me , I know , to say 'Yes , ' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste ;	5719.5335272223065
It is admirable !	8458.182239532696
They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which I cannot wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects .	5935.75874237082
pride he probably had , and if not , it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town , where the family did not visit .	7852.347864722186
But , Lizzy , you can tell us whether it is like or not .	4386.3748052718465
and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's dying an old maid .	6860.19208493782
The wisest and the best of men , nay , the wisest and best of their actions , may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke .	6734.901295445804
Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper ;	9000.003101534048
and it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning , and never said a word about it till now .	3444.9694883034813
After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room , from the sideboard to the fender , to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London , Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden , which was large and well laid out , and to the cultivation of which he attended himself .	4615.5556534151
I should infinitely prefer a book .	6760.310012081778
but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless Darcy returned within the stated time .	6817.527941758899
This is not to be borne .	6045.476887741364
Had his first appearance , or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining , been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Darcy , the gardener's expression of surprise , on beholding his master , must immediately have told it .	6485.089787495145
Hurst had therefore nothing to do , but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep .	6600.555190780038
I thought it would never be over ;	5792.9469131013
But if I do not take your likeness now , I may never have another opportunity .	5229.637756548423
Elizabeth made no answer , and walked on , her heart swelling with indignation .	4914.901698439624
And do you like her ?	8190.045848973358
It was an evening of no common delight to them all ;	4862.016187409809
I never can be thankful , Bennet , for any thing about the entail .	5838.158575468051
Were the same fair prospect to arise at present , as had flattered them a year ago , every thing , she was persuaded , would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion .	5631.649641903551
He danced only four dances !	12968.516583086204
I have not a doubt of Bingley's sincerity , said Elizabeth warmly ;	4016.0377296975307
Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother , on his approaching marriage , were all that was affectionate and insincere .	6454.95049367836
Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort .	10723.07249061841
He likes to have his own way very well , replied Colonel Fitzwilliam .	7852.10694850367
It was painful , exceedingly painful , to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return .	5195.824324197406
Yes , thought Elizabeth , that would be a delightful scheme , indeed , and completely do for us at once .	4150.511539920785
but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off .	7595.641055610283
said he hastily , as he opened the door .	6217.71923380883
She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own , but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action , she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage .	4482.244436442669
As often as I can .	10908.556166256149
If you love Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham , you must be very happy .	3979.022861745074
She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas .	6396.75947843752
Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming , without changing colour .	4977.6362385527555
1 .	9967.378404281952
You may depend on it , replied the other , for Nicholls was in Meryton last night ;	5600.865673669641
and she could hardly suppress a smile , at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had revolted , in his offer to herself .	4787.700872009131
I told Collins so before you came .	7446.304630433665
I knew , said he , that what I wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary .	3887.1022574451595
Why did not you seek legal redress ?	11042.149612924419
When they repaired to the dining-room , Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place , which , in all their former parties , had belonged to him , by her sister .	4547.943489209213
It was necessary to laugh , when she would rather have cried .	4998.765918585467
Soon after you left me on Saturday , I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were .	6884.4284112501055
but I always speak what I think .	5205.300343350352
And rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had not Collins thus addressed her , When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ;	5068.634334393158
But that is nothing to us .	5053.211793875998
Our distress , my dear Lizzy , is very great .	6588.165688680726
Not that I mean to find fault with you , for such things I know are all chance in this world .	6672.282932185268
I never saw such capacity , and taste , and application , and elegance , as you describe , united .	5764.969393355843
the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice .	8222.106372704971
found fault with the arrangement of the furniture , or detected the housemaid in negligence ;	11535.452377111635
How can you contrive to write so even ?	9419.750477071257
that my dear mother had more command over herself ;	10011.560830467133
The two first dances , however , brought a return of distress ;	6131.927168483089
The room in which the ladies sat was backwards .	10048.877177299937
My father's opinion of me does me the greatest honour ;	9936.297579665752
It may be easily believed , that however little of novelty could be added to their fears , hopes , and conjectures , on this interesting subject , by its repeated discussion , no other could detain them from it long , during the whole of the journey .	6141.75338803149
but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption !	7288.155074080327
The coach , therefore , took them the first stage of their journey , and brought its master back to Longbourn .	5584.432511829347
cried Jane , what do you mean , Sir ?	6877.030286007254
for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Darcy's steward , and of that , I can assure you , he informed me himself .	4258.332773253598
Her figure was elegant , and she walked well ;	7519.41966938161
I have faults enough , but they are not , I hope , of understanding .	4137.128457334291
but she could not approve him ;	3735.0808391204105
and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so full of contradictions and varieties , sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance , and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination .	5591.602269731718
Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections ?	10758.2786325393
CHAPTER I It is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune , must be in want of a wife .	5287.169145147617
I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then Georgiana , unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me .	5288.1376292207915
It is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married , continued her mother , but at the same time , Bingley , it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me .	2599.473115384888
And in the first place , let us hear what has happened to you all , since you went away .	4212.738397341679
Besides , it will not much signify what one wears this summer , after the shire have left Meryton , and they are going in a fortnight .	6358.315342711805
His debts are to be paid , amounting , I believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her , and his commission purchased .	4724.129026163199
He dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday .	5660.373929115099
Her mother's ungraciousness , made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind ;	6941.947315289381
But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes .	5499.641952228531
You are rather disposed to call his interference officious ?	8418.834127369517
and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go , she did not seem to ask for compassion .	4730.8584533828935
Whilst wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and Elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of Darcy approaching them , and at no great distance .	5339.621159060637
At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here .	7270.638633040768
and it was but the other day , that I recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her .	2978.0249698943767
We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side , said Jane : I hope and trust they will yet be happy .	5803.7277913683765
that she had a new gown , or a new parasol , which she would have described more fully , but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry , as Forster called her , and they were going to the camp ;	4500.213097721477
If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement , I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one .	5364.4910275615075
And pray may I ask ?	10034.664294980732
I should never be happy without him , so think it no harm to be off .	5714.242368562662
have you heard from my uncle ?	14050.233886529533
He repeated the question , with some surprise at her silence .	7975.554903403524
and a report soon followed that Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly .	6740.480102734609
for she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening , although utterly unknown to her before .	5399.556807787321
and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry her , had she been his relation .	3407.2689170391463
As for your Elizabeth's picture , you must not attempt to have it taken , for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes ?	6407.281816652028
It would have suited me in every respect .	6478.566437542174
He immediately offered to fetch her others ;	9587.511723000101
I ought not to have said a word about it .	4131.150313745602
His father was an excellent man , said Gardiner .	8683.375171903603
One ought not to repine ;	14157.148466079077
I cannot catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as I often see done .	5601.376540497878
She was not sorry , however , to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung .	4074.7251401570556
the other is Charlotte's marriage .	12922.659863518704
But you How are you ?	6944.794297134805
He danced only four dances , though gentlemen were scarce ;	10396.517732825978
Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ;	6078.084034571058
Good gracious !	13026.898755758692
I am more likely to want time than courage , Elizabeth .	5109.450724070714
And though he exclaimed at the term , she found that it had been pretty much the case .	6188.646275359168
and continually was she repeating , Why is he so altered ?	9419.170002333733
You may well warn me against such an evil .	6569.883751286558
They were of course all intending to be surprised ;	7191.819840099735
my head is always full of something else .	10440.216263181223
She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an inmate of Darcy's house , and mentioned with raptures , some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture .	6208.6246979377065
This however was no evil to Elizabeth , and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough ;	6602.242129675588
He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before , on his reading Collins's letter ;	6407.0652731579385
Jane , cried Elizabeth , was there a servant belonging to it , who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ?	4565.163984176466
They travelled as expeditiously as possible ;	10462.70512610264
You are a very strange creature by way of a friend !	6780.140932184225
When Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed , which certainly was not unseldom , she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte .	7631.7860105574955
The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity ;	5108.7438539958775
Your tempers are by no means unlike .	10167.444294565554
and , after receiving her answer , asked in an hesitating manner how long Darcy had been staying there .	5695.030039067114
His being so sure of succeeding , was wrong , said she ;	7432.843829840862
Allow me to say , Lady Catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application , have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged .	5875.605918704953
GARDINER .	53485.85308991369
and before he went away , an engagement was formed , chiefly through his own and Bennet's means , for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband .	5541.124621798559
you cannot go yourself .	17415.154236120696
That Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham , before his arrival , but without gaining any satisfactory information ;	7500.777086959411
They were in fact very fine ladies ;	8164.3267387561555
Well , any friend of Bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure ;	6948.137502018951
Come , let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly .	8304.53704745727
I am , dear Sir , c .	3657.2149621505664
or , as the happiest alternative , been secluded from the world , in some distant farm house .	6165.844317180747
And how impossible in others !	13653.327872831373
but of the truth of what I shall relate , I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity .	6187.026818970649
Nay , if you are so serious about it , I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled .	5406.858074180647
Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity , a warmth , a delight , which words could but poorly express .	9329.97709283166
At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ;	4351.400066439945
but from what the report of their engagement could originate , Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ;	6702.75373932997
my dear brother , replied Bennet , that is exactly what I could most wish for .	5873.311627017714
Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude , but said nothing .	5312.412674335287
it is very hard to think that she might have been Collins's wife by this time , had not it been for her own perverseness .	4485.749326878933
He could not speak a word for full ten minutes .	6942.797530433817
If this be the case , he deserves you .	6001.262701678228
His attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect ;	11062.169006928778
It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast ;	7795.53754769883
I am sure you will be very comfortable there .	2661.2824929244002
At length the Parsonage was discernible .	10812.695949018336
so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as your's seems to have been .	7602.060870046726
I am afraid you will be angry .	3077.259979355742
He certainly looked at her friend a great deal , but the expression of that look was disputable .	5748.417873902889
She was less handsome than her brother , but there was sense and good humour in her face , and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle .	4692.406891190534
London : Printed for T Egerton , Military Library , Whitehall .	5861.8704179674305
and she parted from him convinced , that whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing .	6281.727398229992
I often tell my other girls they are nothing to her .	5424.129334147107
Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction and a moment's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible , she sat down again , and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion .	5512.400432095412
I am not afraid of you , said he , smilingly .	2293.626549726459
I do not think it is very pretty ;	3000.56677339831
Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he ?	6284.647635476601
1 .	9967.378404281952
but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing , and between herself and Elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to .	5680.974289527848
MY DEAR NIECE , I have just received your letter , and shall devote this whole morning to answering it , as I foresee that a little writing will not comprise what I have to tell you .	5236.89283962818
and , though Kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense , since the disturbers of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended , was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance , by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp .	6175.06650852224
That is capital , added her sister , and they both laughed heartily .	5427.095785689501
Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer , as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces .	6723.689468010796
The girls grieved over such a number of ladies ;	9038.037181451284
said Elizabeth .	8045.34531137579
Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity , are not worth a regret .	8158.98805797934
It is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and interest , for him to be guilty of it .	3993.684750499425
What a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago , would now have been gladly and gratefully received !	5745.8395452312625
and I understand from Gardiner , that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all , before she leaves the South .	5088.700807790039
said that she had liked him better when they met in Kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning .	4352.8779574614455
We are speaking of music , Madam , said he , when no longer able to avoid a reply .	4443.131945975158
and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you .	3346.438223679322
They are descended on the maternal side , from the same noble line ;	7663.606209458136
And is this all ?	10888.260374356812
They have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression .	7076.381111910923
The boy protested that she should not ;	8407.620949999759
Bennet accepted the challenge , observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements .	8619.401876473758
They have at least that advantage .	9110.663093372967
It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge ;	5209.487089561316
My father began life in the profession which your uncle , Philips , appears to do so much credit to but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late Darcy , and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property .	5509.525909873077
That will not do for a compliment to Darcy , Caroline , cried her brother because he does not write with ease .	5355.058834688677
Adieu .	53485.85308991369
you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner .	11511.656999297784
but intricate characters are the most amusing .	10643.977239185799
grieved shocked .	35589.068999354975
This , she would not hear of ;	5918.822674319104
It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity ;	7177.062298616363
Hope was over , entirely over ;	15188.520347405998
F3 .	33751.168826691726
She longed to enquire of the housekeeper , whether her master were really absent , but had not courage for it .	5274.501108057899
Darcy was punctual in his return , and as Lydia informed you , attended the wedding .	6779.3961118387615
It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's interested wishes , and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes , however openly or artfully spoken , could influence a young man so totally independent of every one .	5232.603328130505
I will speak to her about it myself directly .	6359.594857390195
Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley ;	7708.480043203219
and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand .	5721.74915047497
The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new , yet I think it is well expressed .	6721.6095677355315
The supposition did not pain her .	7663.739387565573
Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense .	7414.844290691385
The latter was thinking only of his breakfast .	8641.065796497018
Their father then went to the library to write , and the girls walked into the breakfast-room .	5838.097959593143
and then , what do you think we did ?	4610.832137924434
he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it ;	5131.466325936709
and , after a pause of several minutes , was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion , who , in a manner , which though it spoke compassion , spoke likewise restraint , said , I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing , concern .	4411.235321412446
and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added , I have never had a cross word from him in my life , and I have known him ever since he was four years old .	3891.5382081506964
Wherever you and Jane are known , you must be respected and valued ;	9229.815334066303
but Darcy can please where he chuses .	9989.537930527624
Only think of that my dear ;	11431.612449865446
and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room , its aspect and its furniture , he addressed himself particularly to her , as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him .	3563.4033297645665
They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends , and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family , when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window , and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle , driving up the street .	5038.877599846885
But it ought to be done , and if you will give me a sheet of paper , it shall be done directly .	3674.3906099982587
The least agreeable circumstance in the business , was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet , whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person .	6052.178223247705
And that , said Reynolds , pointing to another of the miniatures , is my master and very like him .	6536.439394848367
I should not be surprised , said Darcy , if he were to give it up , as soon as any eligible purchase offers .	3177.7790126946315
I thought him very sly ;	9223.28170932791
When is your turn to come ?	12449.746719311834
'Lady Catherine , ' said she , 'you have given me a treasure .	9543.15069891064
I shall never forget her appearance this morning .	4885.772315745848
But no , recollecting herself , that could never be : my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me : I should not have been allowed to invite them .	4062.7946257721687
We passed each other several times .	12988.980445948599
When they all removed to Brighton , therefore , you had no reason , I suppose , to believe them fond of each other .	3897.4742431231775
Her reflections were in general satisfactory .	12533.965706076964
The officers will find women better worth their notice .	8599.720411290422
E2 .	61437.34662756191
Let us sit down .	13129.627300981372
With your good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others !	6897.572123767401
While Sir William was with them , Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig , and shewing him the country ;	7986.288698274573
she felt all the compliment it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother .	4333.208618502657
You have sense , and we all expect you to use it .	5274.933143754879
Their other engagements were few ;	14930.917468748712
Change of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home , may be as useful as anything .	9334.522795122146
Oh yes !	15944.74989990565
I often think , said she , that there is nothing so bad as parting with one's friends .	3946.1928279504646
Mary had neither genius nor taste ;	15053.912500301682
1813 .	40535.86118978839
You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner in such society ;	5986.801225191083
and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character , in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of Elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end .	5170.018005601212
Elizabeth , for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts , now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since her coming away .	5021.019393159104
repeated Bennet .	22426.145255443556
but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment , had they sat in one equally lively ;	6077.86907721822
Oh !	5043.244884590713
She paused , and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse .	6669.053663822194
And to be kept back on such a motive !	8935.587893343807
